We derive revenues primarily from three sources: software licenses, services, and maintenance. Wegenerally determine software license fees based on the number of modules, servers, users and/or sites licensed. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, and consulting services. We bill primarilyunder time and materials arrangements and recognize revenues as we perform services. Maintenance agreements typically are for a one to three year term, usually commencing the time of the initial product license. We generally bill maintenance feesannually in advance under agreements with terms of one to three years, and then recognize the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for software licenses,services and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize the related revenues.  Our cost of revenues for licenses includesamortization of capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits and value added reseller (VAR) commissions. Costs for maintenance and services revenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer supportand consulting, and other personnel-related expenses as well as agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel.  Our selling expenses generally include the salary and commissions we pay to our direct sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs. Our general and administrative expensesgenerally include the salary and benefits we pay to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as office rent, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees.  Industry Background  In response to increasing global competition, companies are continually seekingnew ways to enhance the productivity of their operations. Computer software applications can be an effective tool for companies to re-engineer and streamline their core business processes. ERP applications help companies reduce employee headcountand increase employee utilization through recording, consolidating, and reporting the large quantities of transactional data that our generated through daily operations. Core ERP applications include automation of financials, human resources, andmanufacturing functions. Included in the manufacturing function are supply chain applications that assist companies in managing relationships with external trading partners such as customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.  2 Table of ContentsCompanies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners within theextended enterprise or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, improved customer service, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex network ofrelationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners to forecast demand, source, manufacture and deliver goods and services to the end consumer. Supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying productsor services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that impact the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting.  Today, several market trends are driving organizations to expand collaboration with trading partners along the supply chain. A general shift in marketpower has forced manufacturers and distributors to become more responsive to retailers and consumers, which has increased the demand for improved planning capabilities. At the same time, global economic conditions and competitive pressures areforcing manufacturers to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. As a result, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are increasingly under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to improvemanufacturing efficiency and logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the increasing globalization and complexity of theinteractions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The growth and rapid adoption of the Internet hasenhanced the ability of organizations to integrate their business processes through collaborative planning to synchronize internal assets and production with external demand and supplier capabilities. Global Internet technology adoption and supplychain strategies are converging to create a competitive advantage by reducing the cost of goods sold, improving customer service, building global brands and increasing global supply chain visibility as companies move product to market quicker. Ourcustomers goal is to cost effectively provide the right product in the right place at the right time at a competitive price.  Whereappropriate, our software solutions are designed to leverage the Internet to expand the potential user community and streamline collaboration among the various trading partners in the supply chain. The supply chain planning process focuses on demandforecasting, inventory simulation, global sourcing, distribution, transportation and manufacturing planning and scheduling. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize production scheduling, streamlineglobal sourcing, reduce inventory costs, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service.  The supplychain execution function addresses procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, order fulfillment and distributing products throughout the supply chain. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on the effectivemanagement of warehouse and transportation operations and the need for integration with planning systems and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both thebusiness-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors.  In a report entitled Increase Profitability by Mastering Demand(April 22, 2004), a leading information technology analyst firm, AMR Research, stated that increased demand visibility is achieved across the supply chain through increased collaboration with supply chain partners. With that bettervisibility comes perfect order performance. Inter-enterprise collaboration, a byproduct of the Demand-Driven Supply Network (DDSN), is vital to success in mastering demand in this new business context. With better demand forecast accuracy, companiesaverage 15% lower inventories, 17% stronger perfect order fulfillment, and 35% shorter cash-to-cash cycle times.  In order toeffectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution, and supply chain event management software that provides for integrated communication, optimization andcollaboration among the various constituents throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration synchronizes production plans with demand forecasts, thereby minimizing bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory anddistribution network problems.   3 Table of ContentsIn addition, companies seek integrated planning and supply chain execution systems that further optimizethe flow of products to their customers through enhanced transportation and warehouse management capabilities. Organizations are also demanding solutions that are modular and scaleable to fit the changing needs of the organization and offer rapiddeployment and time-to-benefit and distribution network problems.

Customers can use FlowManufacturing in conjunction with traditional manufacturing or they can use it as the sole manufacturing solution throughout an enterprise. Flow Manufacturing represents the industrys most comprehensive solution designed expressly forcompanies considering the adoption of this approach to manufacturing. The solution is comprised of the following modules:     Line Design     Kanban Management     Demand Smoothing     Product Costing     Engineering Change Control     Method Sheet Management (Work Instructions)  FlowManufacturing Benefits:  e-Business support. To meet e-business demands, we anticipate that many manufacturers will replacetraditional mass production methods with Flow Manufacturing techniques. The benefits of Flow Manufacturing, such as reduced cost and reduced lead-time, offer a more appropriate structure for responding to e-business demands. With Flow Manufacturing,manufacturers build the product in response to customer demand.  Scaleable Implementation. We can scale Flow Manufacturing to handlea single production line up to the requirements of a complex multi-plant, multi-source manufacturing environment. The solution can also co-exist with traditional manufacturing so that manufacturers can use Flow Manufacturing for some portions ofproduction and assembly while maintaining traditional manufacturing for others.  Integration. We can license Flow Manufacturing inconjunction with our e-intelliprise ERP suite, or we can license it to companies that are using the enterprise solutions of other vendors. Industry-standard data formats, interfaces and protocols facilitate this integration.  Rapid Deployment. Flow Manufacturing has a modular design, which we believe streamlines implementation and allows deployment in a relatively shorttime frame. The comprehensive functionality of each module generally permits customers to implement the solutions with nominal modifications. In addition, Flow Manufacturings Windows-based interface and other tools and techniques reducestraining requirements and implementation tasks.  e-APPLICATIONS  e-Applications streamline business processes and create competitive advantage that helps businesses leverage the full value of their existing ERP and legacy systems.

We believe that e-forms offers an effective,easy-to-use communication channel to external trading partners. e-Forms provides a secure, self-service link between non-host users and purchasing, requisitioning, accounts payable, accounts receivable, customer order processing and manufacturingsystems. Using e-mail, fax and XML/FTP gateways, this solutions workflow engine routes documents from host applications. The review, approval and update loop uses HTML formatting and receives instructions interactively.  e-Payables. This module streamlines administrative processes regarding purchases online not using purchase orders, enabling users tocost-effectively transact business from any location at any time. Using the Internet or internal intranets, e-Payables provides a secure interface into an accounts payable system.  e-Receivables. This solution is designed to supply account information online to an enterprises customers. e-Receivables can help improvecash flow, reduce the cost of financing sales and, by automating routine tasks such as customer queries, enable strategic focus on profit creation and reduce time demands on customer service representatives.  Purchase Order Tracking and Vendor Collaboration. Companies that source globally may experience problems communicating with distant suppliers.This module combines some of the features of e-Procurement and e-Forms with the ability to negotiate delivery schedules. The system allows buyers to electronically send purchase orders to suppliers, receive acknowledgments into a secure web site,then communicate and negotiate delivery schedules via a secure web site. It uses e-mail alerts extensively to notify buyers and suppliers of changes to requirements and schedules.  e-Connect. We designed this solution to enable the exchange of XML-enabled data. e-Connect provides the link to extend the ERP back-officesoftware to the Web and to enable users to interact with the ERP software via the web. e-Connect also enables the interactive communication between Web applications, marketplaces, trading exchanges, suppliers, B2B transactions and the back officeERP systems.  e-Process Management.

We account for our backlog in deferred revenues (refer to note 1(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are not reliant on government customers. Integrated System Design  Whilecustomers can use our software applications individually, we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet unique customer requirements. The user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for aparticular business problem. The license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi-module, multiple-user solution incorporating the full range of our products.  Customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support/maintenance agreement. To meet those customers needs, weestablished a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, custom programming, on-site installation, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training. We provide theseservices, frequently referred to as systems integration services, for an additional fee normally under a separate contract, based upon time and materials utilized.  Sales and Marketing  We market our products through direct and indirect sales channels. We conductour principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and have sales and/or support offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Pittsburgh. We manage sales channels outside of North America from our internationaloffices in the United Kingdom and Spain.  Logility has a number of marketing alliances, including those with IBM, SAP and SSA GlobalTechnologies (SSA). Generally, these marketing alliance agreements provide the vendors with non-exclusive rights to market our products and access to our marketing materials and product training. Some highlights of these agreements areas follows:    IBMwe entered into an agreement with IBM on March 17, 2000 pursuant to which we modified our Supply Chain products, with IBMs technical and financialassistance, to operate with IBMs eServer iSeries (AS/400) platform. Also, we agreed to market and support the IBM-compatible supply chain products that resulted from our efforts. IBM may also market our supply chain products and referpotential customers to Logility.     SAP On January 23, 2006, Logility was named a SAP® Business One Partner to provide supply chain solutions for the small and midsize business market in the United States. Logility will integrate itsDemand Solutions application suite with SAP Business One to drive supply chain improvements for small and midsize businesses (SMB). Demand Solutions will extend the core business automation capabilities of SAP Business One and provide criticalsupply chain expertise to help customers predict future demand and make informed decisions to optimize inventory turns, customer service levels and profitability.     SSA Global TechnologiesOn November 17, 2001, Logility granted SSA a worldwide, non-exclusive license to name, package, market, distribute and supply theLogility Voyager Solutions suite as BPCS (Business Planning and Control Software) Collaborative Commerce powered by Logility. In exchange, SSA agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and sell the software. Thisagreement had an original expiration date of April 30, 2004, but is automatically extended for additional one year periods, unless either party terminates the agreement by giving 90 days written notice.   20 Table of ContentsIn addition to these marketing alliances, Logility has developed a network of international agents whoassist in selling our products outside the United States. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. These independent distributors and resellers, locatedin Canada, South America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region, distribute our product lines in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products. With theacquisition of Demand Management, Logility gained access to a global distribution channel consisting of 23 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 70 countries.  We support our sales activities by conducting a variety of marketing programs including public relations, direct marketing, advertising, trade shows,product seminars, industry speakers, user group conferences and ongoing customer communication and industry analysts programs. We also participate in industry conferences such as those organized by the American Production and Inventory ControlSpecialists (APICS) and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSMCP), formerly called the Council of Logistics Management (CLM).  Licenses  Like many business application software firms, our software revenue consists principally of fees generated fromlicensing our software products. In consideration of the payment of license fees, we typically grant nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual licenses, which are primarily business unit, user-specific and geographically restricted. Our standardlicense agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software. In these agreements we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation. The prices for our products are typically functions of the number of modules licensed and the number of servers, users and sites for whichthe solution is designed and deployed.  Customer Service and Support  We provide the following services and support to our customers:  Implementation Support: We offerour customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products. Our consultants help customers define the nature of their project, and subsequently proceed through the implementationprocess. We provide training for all users and managers involved. We first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators, and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation. Additional services beyondimplementation can include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers.  Implementation:General Training Services. We offer our customers post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we typically charge on a daily basis. Customers that purchase implementationservices receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases. Implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months, depending on factors such as the complexity of a customersexisting systems, the number of modules purchased, and the number of end users.  Product Maintenance and Updates: SupportServices. We provide our customers with ongoing product support services. Typically, we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one to three year term, billed annually in advance, at the time of the productlicense with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under these contracts, we provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correctionservices. We provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven-day-a-week, 24-hours-a-day basis through telephone, electronic mail and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance.   21 Table of ContentsResearch and Development  Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technologicaldevelopments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systemsand relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet.  Logilitys current release of Logility Voyager Solutions is version 7.5. This version uses an Internet-based architecture for maximumscalability and messaging functionality that supports the increasingly distributed nature of supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution and collaborative commerce. Logility Voyager Solutions interface with software ofleading ERP vendors such as SAP, Oracle, and SSA Global Technologies.  The current release of Demand Solution One is version 9.1 andthe current release of Demand Solutions Stores is version 4.1. These products are designed to work with a wide variety of MRP, ERP and legacy enterprise applications.  We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements,develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our productsacross distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within amulti-tiered supply chain environment, including the Internet.  Our client/server and Internet-based solutions, which utilize the latesttechnologies, will be important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2006, we employed 92 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities.  Competition  Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspectsof the supply chain, as well as the enterprise application market as a whole. Our existing competitors include:     Large enterprise resource planning (ERP) application software vendors such as SAP and Oracle, which recently acquired PeopleSoft/JD Edwards and Retek, each of which offerssophisticated ERP solutions that currently, or may in the future, incorporate supply chain management modules, advanced planning and scheduling, warehouse management, transportation or collaboration software;     Vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market, including but not limited to, vendors such as i2 Technologies and JDA Software which recently acquired Manugistics;    Other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supplychain management software; and     Internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments.  In addition, our Logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors, including ERP vendors that from time to time jointly market Logilitys products as a complement to their ownsystems. To the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to Logilitys products, their significant installed customer base, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution couldprovide a competitive advantage over Logilitys products.   22 Table of ContentsWe also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter themarket for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships amongthemselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge andrapidly gain significant market share. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.  The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products and related services such ascustomer support, training and implementation services. Other factors important to customers and prospects include:     customer service and satisfaction;     ability to provide relevant customer references;     compliance with industry-specific requirements and standards;     flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements;     ability to generate business benefits;     rapid payback and measurable return on investment;     vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation; and     initial license price, cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership.  Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence, longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, anda larger installed base of customers than we have. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices, payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. In order to be successful in the future, we mustcontinue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations. We may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms. Our competitors may be able to respondmore quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.  We believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive, integrated solutions, our list of referenceable customers, the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers, oursubstantial investment in product development, our deep domain expertise, the ease of use of our software products, our customer support and implementation services, our ability to deploy quickly, and our ability to deliver rapid return oninvestment for our customers.  Proprietary Rights and Licenses  Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality proceduresand contractual provisions, which may afford only limited protection. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we rely on the limited protection afforded bysuch confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenanceand timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We presently have no patents or patent applications pending. The source code for our proprietary software is protected asa trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally copyrights on our products expire 95 years after the year of first publication of each   23 Table of Contentsproduct. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and customers, and control access to and distribution of oursoftware, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks.  We provide our software products to customers under non-exclusive license agreements. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect ourintellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers. Although the license agreements place restrictions on the customers use of our products, unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur. Despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects ofour products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, toprotect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  In the future, we may increasingly be subjectto claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Although we are not aware that any of our productsinfringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third partiesfor infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims initiated by us against third parties, can be time consuming and expensive todefend, prosecute or resolve. Moreover, an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringingtechnology, require a substantial amount of attention from management, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products, any of whichwould have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. To the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that any suchlicenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  We have relicensed, and expect in the future to relicense, certainsoftware from third parties for use in connection with our products. There can be no assurance that these third-party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us oncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. The termination of any such licenses or product offerings, or the failure of the third-party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products, could result in delays in our ability to ship certainof our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources. Any required replacement licenses could prove costly. Further, any such delay, if it becomes extended, could result in a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.  Company Strategy  Theobjective of American Software is to become a leading provider of enterprise-wide ERP and collaborative supply chain solutions to enable small, medium, large and Fortune 1000 companies to optimize their operations associated with the planning,sourcing, manufacture, storage, and distribution of products. Our strategy includes the following key elements:  Leverage and ExpandInstalled Base of Customers. We currently target businesses in the consumer goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, apparel and sewn products, and oil and gas industries. We intend to continue to leverage our installed base ofmore than 1,450 customers to introduce additional   24 Table of Contentsfunctionality, product upgrades, and complementary modules. In addition, we intend to expand sales to new customers in our existing vertical markets and totarget additional vertical markets over time.  Continue to Expand Sales and Marketing. We intend to continue to pursue an increasedshare of the market for ERP and supply chain management software solutions by expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe our competitive advantage includes providing a rapid implementation, easy-to-maintain configuration, and quicktime-to-benefit across the full spectrum of customer operations. Logility intends to continue building a direct sales force that is focused on selected vertical markets, such as consumer goods, retail and manufacturing supply chains, and NewGeneration Computing intends to continue to focus on the Apparel, Sewn Goods, and Furniture industries, adding sales and marketing resources when appropriate.  Expand Indirect Channels to Increase Market Penetration. We believe that key relationships with value-added resellers (VARs) will increase sales and expand market penetration of our products and services.For example, on January 23, 2006, Logility was named a SAP® Business One Partner to provide supply chain solutions for the small and midsize business market in the United States. Logility will integrate its Demand Solutions application suite with SAP Business One to drivesupply chain improvements for small and midsize businesses (SMB). Demand Solutions will extend the core business automation capabilities of SAP Business One and provide critical supply chain expertise to help customers predict future demand and makeinformed decisions to optimize inventory turns, customer service levels and profitability. In addition, the acquisition of Demand Management added 9 domestic and 14 international VARs to our indirect channel in fiscal 2005. This experienced globaldistribution network significantly expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 70 countries.  Maintain Technology Leadership. Logility believes that it is a technology leader in the field of collaborative supply chain optimization solutions and intends to continue to provide innovative, advancedsolutions and services to this market. Logility believes that it was one of the earliest providers of supply chain management software solutions on a client-server platform and on Windows, and the first to introduce a collaborative supply chainplanning solution that operates over the Internet. Logility intends to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards.  Invest Aggressively to Build Market Share. We intend to continue to invest to expand our sales force, research and development efforts, andconsulting infrastructure, balanced with our goal of increasing profitability. We believe these investments are necessary to increase our market share and to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market.  Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that select acquisitions or investments may provideopportunities to broaden our product offering to provide more advanced solutions for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presenceand distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the supply chain management market.  Focus on Integrated Collaborative Planning and Supply Chain Execution Solution. Logility believes it is one of the few providers of trulyintegrated supply chain management software solutions addressing demand and supply planning as well as transportation and warehousing logistics requirements. Logility Voyager Solutions provides a comprehensive suite for supply chain planning,warehouse and transportation management with collaboration at its core, streamlining business processes between both internal and external trading partners. Logility intends to continue to focus its development initiatives on enhancing itsend-to-end solution, expanding its embedded performance management architecture and introducing additional capabilities that complement its integrated solution suite.  Increase Penetration of International Markets. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2006, we generated 9% of our total revenues from international sales, resulting from marketing relationships with anumber of international   25 Table of Contentsdistributors. The acquisition of Demand Management by Logility added 9 domestic and 14 international VARs to its indirect channel in fiscal 2005. Thisexperienced global distribution network significantly expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 70 countries. We intend to further expand our international presence by creatingadditional relationships with distributors in South America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region.  Expand StrategicRelationships. Logility intends to expand the depth and number of strategic relationships with leading enterprise software, systems integrators and service providers to integrate the Logility Voyager Solutions suite into theirservices and products and to create joint marketing opportunities. Logility has a number of marketing alliances, including those with IBM , and SAP. In addition, Logility has developed a network of international agents who assist in the sale andsupport of its products. Logility intends to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance its sales and marketing position.  Continue to Focus on Providing High Quality Customer Service. Providing high quality customer service is a critical element of our strategy. We intend to continue to invest in technology and personnel toaccommodate the needs of our growing customer base. We will continue to seek new ways to improve service to our customers.  ImplementE-Business Strategy. The Company has launched an e-Business initiative that will enable the Company to build on current applications while moving toward total Internet-based value chain management. The Companys e-Business strategy includesproducts and services designed to enable the optimization of the customers supply chain and improve collaboration.  Focus onSmall, Midsized and Large Business Markets. Our broad product portfolio allows us to address the unique business needs and complexity of a wide range of enterprises from small, midsize and large global operations.  There can be no assurance, however, that we and Logility will be successful in implementing the strategy outlined above.  Employees  As of April 30, 2006, we had 321full-time employees, including 92 in product research, development and enhancement, 35 in customer support, 108 in professional services, 46 in marketing, sales and sales support, and 40 in accounting, facilities and administration. We believe thatour continued success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel, who may be in great demand. We believe our employee relations are good. We have never had a workstoppage and no employees are represented under collective bargaining arrangements.   ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  A variety of factors may affect our future resultsand the market price of our stock.  We have included certain forward-looking statements in Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We may also make oral and written forward-looking statements from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and otherwise. Actualresults may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section lists some, but not all,of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto,and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.   26 Table of ContentsWe cannot predict every event and circumstance that may impact our business and, therefore, the risks anduncertainties discussed below may not be the only ones you should consider.  The risks and uncertainties discussed below are in additionto those that apply to most businesses generally. In addition, as we continue to operate our business, we may encounter risks of which we are not aware at this time. These additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future, theimpact of which we cannot estimate at this time.  RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS  Our markets are very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.  The markets for oursolutions are very competitive. The intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased in part as a result of the extended period of economic downturn and uncertainty. We expect this intensity of competition to increase in thefuture. Our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Any significant consolidation among ERP or supply chain software companiescould adversely affect our competitive position. Increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions, lower gross margins, longer sales cycles and the loss of market share. Each of these developments could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.  Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greaterresources than we do, and therefore, we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them.  We directly compete with other supply chainsoftware vendors, including SAP, I2 Technologies, Lawson Software, Inc., Oracle Corporation, QAD Inc., SAP AG and others. Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitiveresources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients. The ERP software market has experienced significant consolidation. This consolidation has included numerous mergers and acquisitions, includingtakeovers such as the Oracle/Peoplesoft transaction. As a result, some prospective buyers are experiencing reluctance in purchasing applications that could have a short lifespan due to an acquisition resulting in the applications life beingabruptly cut short. In addition, increased competition and consolidation in these markets is likely to result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and changes in market share, any one of which could adversely affect us. If customers orprospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors, they may elect to purchase competing products from a larger vendor than us since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products. Furthermore, certain of these larger vendors suchas Oracle Corporation may be capable of bundling their software with their database applications, which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications. When we compete with these larger vendors for new customers, we believe that theselarger businesses often attempt to use their size as a competitive advantage against us. Oracle Corporations purchase of Peoplesoft, Inc., Retek Inc., and Siebel Systems, Inc., and other consolidations in the software industry, havefueled uncertainty among customer prospects.  In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current andpotential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion andsale of their products than we can. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new andexisting competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms. Furthermore, potential customers may consider outsourcing options, including application service providers, data center outsourcing and service bureaus as alternativesto licensing our software products. Any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.   27 Table of ContentsIn addition, we compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors, including:    Internet (on demand) software vendors;     single-industry software vendors;     merging enterprise resource optimization software vendors;     human resource management software vendors;     financial management software vendors;     merchandising software vendors;     services automation software vendors; and     outsourced services providers.  As a result, the marketfor enterprise software applications has been and continues to be intensely competitive. Some competitors are increasingly aggressive with their pricing, payment terms and/or issuance of contractual warranties, implementation terms or guarantees.Third party service companies may offer competing maintenance and implementation services to our customers and thereby reduce our opportunities to provide those services. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existingcompetitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers. We expect competition to persist and intensify, which could negatively impact our operating results and market share. The continuing uncertainty in U.S. and global markets may reduce demand for our software and related services, which may negatively affect our revenues and operatingresults.  Our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software, professional services and maintenance. Regionaland global economic change and uncertainty and political instability in key geographic areas have resulted in companies reducing their spending for technology projects generally and delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products andrelated services. The uncertainty posed by the long-term effects of the war in the Middle East, terrorist activities, related uncertainties and risks, and other geopolitical issues may adversely impact the purchasing decisions of current orpotential customers. Future declines in demand for our products or services could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.  We are dependentupon key personnel, and need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas.  Our future operating results dependsignificantly upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key senior management and technical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, James C. Edenfield. None of our key personnel are bound by long-term employmentagreements. The loss of Mr. Edenfield or one or more other key individuals could have an adverse effect on us.  Our future successalso depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualifiedpersonnel. We may be unable to retain our key managerial and technical employees and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel in the future. The failure to attract,train, retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and sales efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service. In particular, the loss of sales personnel could lead to lost sales opportunities because itcan take several months to hire and train replacement sales personnel. If our competitors increase their use of non-compete agreements, the pool of available sales and technical personnel may further narrow in certain areas, even if the non-competeagreements ultimately prove to be unenforceable. We may grant large numbers of stock options to attract and retain personnel, which could be highly dilutive to our stockholders. The volatility or lack of positive   28 Table of Contentsperformance of our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. The loss of key management and technical personnel or theinability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us.  We periodically have restructured our sales force,which can be disruptive.  We continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force. In recent years, we have restructured or made otheradjustments to our sales force in response to factors such as product changes, geographical coverage and other internal considerations. Change in the structures of the sales force and sales force management can result in temporary lack of focus andreduced productivity that may affect revenues in one or more quarters. Future restructuring of our sales force could occur, and if so we may again experience the adverse transition issues associated with such restructuring.  We may be required to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into an agreement, which could negatively impact ourresults of operations.  We may have to delay recognizing license revenue for a significant period of time based on a variety of factors,including:     whether the license agreement relates to then-unavailable software products;     whether transactions include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or other undeliverable elements;    whether the customer demands services that include significant modifications, customizations or complex interfaces that could delay products delivery or acceptance;    whether the transaction involves acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition or if there are identified product-related issues, such as known defects; and    whether the transaction involves payment terms or fees that depend upon contingencies.  These factors and other specific accounting requirements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for software revenue recognition require that we have very precise terms in our license agreements toallow us to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services. Although we have a standard form of license agreement that we believe meets the criteria under GAAP for current revenue recognition on delivered elements, wenegotiate and revise these terms and conditions in many transactions. Therefore, it is possible that from time to time we may license our software or provide services with terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time ofdelivery or even as work on the project is completed.  We are dependent upon the retail industry for a significant amount of our revenues. Historically, we have a significant portion of our revenues from the license of software products and the sale of collaborativeapplications that address vertical market opportunities with manufacturers and wholesalers that supply retail customers. The success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry, which in turn are subject tointense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure, which is often accompanied by large-scale hardwarepurchases or other capital commitments. As a result, demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns in our customers industries.  We believe the retail industry remains cautious in its level of investment in information technology during the difficult economic cycle of the last fewyears, and the uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist   29 Table of Contentsattacks and any continued conflict in Iraq. We remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions, consolidations and the disappointing results ofretailers in certain markets. The retail industry will be negatively impacted if weak economic conditions or fear of additional terrorist attacks and wars persist for an extended period of time. Weak and uncertain economic conditions have in thepast, and may in the future, negatively impact our revenues, including potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs, elongation of our selling cycles, and reduction in the demand for our products.As a result, it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close. In addition, weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products orservices. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business, our quarterly or annual operating results and our financial condition.  We also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating, and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographic regions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability topay for our products and services. Such consolidation has in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact our revenues, reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We may derive a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter from a limited number of large, non-recurring license sales.  We expect to continue to experience from time to time large, individual license sales, which may cause significant variations in quarterly license fees.We also believe that purchasing our products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of a customers capital resources. Therefore, a downturn in any customers business could result in ordercancellations that could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and quarterly results. Moreover, declines in general economic conditions could precipitate significant reductions in corporate spending for information technology, whichcould result in delays or cancellations of orders for our products.  Our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict quarterly revenue levels andoperating results.  Because license and implementation fees for our software products are substantial and the decision to purchase ourproducts typically involves members of our customers senior management, the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year. Accordingly, the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict, and the delay of an ordercould cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors. Moreover, to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from individual software products andtoward more costly integrated suites of software and services, our sales cycle may lengthen, which could increase the likelihood of delays and cause the effect of a delay to become more pronounced. Delays in sales could cause significant shortfallsin our revenues and operating results for any particular period. Also, it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenues from sales of our products because our existing and prospective customers often take significant timeevaluating our products before licensing them. The period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from nine months to more than one year. During the evaluation period, prospective customers may decide not to purchaseor may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons, including:     reduced demand for enterprise software solutions;     introduction of products by our competitors;     lower prices offered by our competitors;     changes in budgets and purchasing priorities; and     reduced need to upgrade existing systems.  Our existingand prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefits of our products. This may also lead to delays in receiving customers orders.  30 Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our services revenues from a small number of customers. If these customers were todiscontinue the usage of our services or delay their implementation our total revenues would be adversely affected.  We derive asignificant portion of our services revenues, and total revenues, from a small number of customers using our services for product enhancement and other optional services. If these customers were to discontinue or delay the usage of these services,or obtain these services from a competitor, our services revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected. Customers may delay or terminate implementation of our services due to budgetary constraints related to economic uncertainty,dissatisfaction with product quality, the difficulty of prioritizing a surplus of information technology projects, changes in business strategy, personnel or priorities, or for other reasons. Such customers may be less likely to invest in additionalsoftware in the future and to continue to pay for software maintenance. Since our business relies to a large extent upon sales to existing customers and since maintenance and services revenues are key elements of our revenue base, any reduction inthese sales or these maintenance and services payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Services revenues carry lower gross margins than license revenues and an overall increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues could have an adverse impact on our business.  Because service revenues have lower gross margins than license revenues, an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by service revenuescould have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results. As a result, an increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues and a change in the mix between services that are provided byour employees versus services provided by third-party consultants may negatively affect our gross margins.  If our customers elect not to renewmaintenance contracts after the initial maintenance period, and the loss of those customers is not offset by new maintenance customers, our maintenance revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected.  Upon the purchase of a software license, our customers typically enter into a maintenance contract with a term from approximately one to three years. If,after this initial maintenance period, customers elect not to renew their maintenance contracts, and we do not offset the loss of those customers by new maintenance customers as a result of new license fees, our maintenance revenues and totalrevenues would be adversely affected.  We may not be successful in convincing customers to migrate to current or future releases of our products, whichmay lead to reduced services and maintenance revenues and less future business from existing customers.  Our customers may not bewilling to incur the costs or invest the resources necessary to complete upgrades to current or future releases of our products. This may lead to our loss of services and maintenance revenues and future business from customers that continue tooperate prior versions of our products or choose to no longer use our products.  We may change our pricing practices, which could adversely impactoperating margins or customer ordering patterns.  The intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduceour prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to competesuccessfully. For these and other reasons, in the future, we may choose to make changes to our pricing practices. For example, we may (i) offer additional discounts to customers, (ii) increase (or decrease) the use of pricing that involvesperiodic fees based on the number of users of a product, or (iii) change maintenance pricing. Such changes could reduce margins or inhibit our ability to sell our products.   31 Table of ContentsIf accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change or companies we acquire have applied suchstandards differently than we do or have not applied them at all, our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices or we may incur the expense and risks associated with an audit or restatement ofthe acquired companys financial statements.  There are several accounting standards and interpretations covering revenuerecognition for the software industry. These pronouncements include Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104, which explain how the SEC staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied to or interpreted for transactions notaddressed by existing rules. These standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance. We believe that we currently comply with these standards.  The accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of these pronouncements with the objective of providingadditional guidance on their application and with respect to potential interpretations related to so-called multiple element arrangements in which a single contract includes a software license, a maintenance services agreement or otherelements that are bundled together in a total offering to the customer. These discussions and the issuance of new interpretations, once finalized, could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices, whichcould change the timing of recognized revenue. They could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices which could result in increased administrative costs, lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect ourreported revenues and results of operations. In addition, companies we acquire may have historically interpreted software revenue recognition rules differently than we do or may not have been subject to US GAAP as a result of reporting underlocal GAAP in a foreign country. If we discover that companies we have acquired have interpreted and applied software revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by US GAAP, we could be required to devote significant managementresources, and incur the expense associated with an audit, restatement or other examination of the acquired companies financial statements.  Serious harm to our business could result if our encryption technology fails to ensure the security of our customers online transactions.  The secure exchange of confidential information over public networks is a significant concern of consumers engaging in on-line transactions and interaction. Some of our software applications use encryption technologyto provide the security necessary to affect the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in a compromise orbreach of the algorithms that these applications use to protect customer transaction data. If any compromise or breach were to occur, it could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our customers lose confidence in the security of data on the Internet, our revenues could be adversely affected.  Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for our customers. Attempts by experienced computerprogrammers, or hackers, to penetrate client network security or the security of web sites to misappropriate confidential information are currently an industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers and networks across all platforms. Despite effortsto address these risks, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products (or the Internet in general) could lead some customers to seek to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitors products which are notInternet-based applications. Customers may also increase their spending to protect their computer networks from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenues.  32 Table of ContentsWe depend on third-party technology which, if it should become unavailable or if it contains defects, could result inincreased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products.  We license critical third-party software products that weincorporate into our own software products. We are likely to incorporate and include additional third-party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings. If our relations with any of these third-party softwareproviders are impaired, and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may bemore difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance thatthese third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software. If the cost of licensing any of these third-party software productssignificantly increases, our gross margin levels could significantly decrease.  Our future growth depends upon our ability to develop and sustainrelationships with complementary vendors to market and implement our software products, and failure to develop and sustain these relationships could have a material adverse affect on our operating performance and financial condition. We are developing, maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors, such as software companies, consultingfirms, resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships, which couldadversely affect our operating margins. We may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively. Our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and, in many cases, may beterminated by either party without cause. Many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors. There can be no assurance that any organization will continueits involvement with us and our products. The loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.  We may be unable to retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products.  As a software company, we have been required to migrate our products and services from mainframe to customer-server to web-based environments. Inaddition, we have been required to adapt our products to emerging standards for operating systems, databases and other technologies. We will be unable to compete effectively if we are unable to:     maintain and enhance our technological capabilities to correspond to these emerging environments and standards;     develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs; or     anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.  A substantial portion of our research and development resources is devoted to product upgrades that address regulatory and support requirements. Only the remainder of our limited research and development resources isavailable for new products. New products require significant development investment. That investment is further constrained because of the added costs of developing new products that work with multiple operating systems or databases. We faceuncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products. If we do not attract sufficient customer interest in those products, we will not realize a return on ourinvestment and our operating results will be adversely affected.  Our core products face competition from new or revised technologies thatmay render our existing technology less competitive or obsolete, reducing the demand for our products. As a result, we must continually   33 Table of Contentsredesign our products to incorporate these new technologies and to adapt our software products to operate on, and comply with evolving industry standards forhardware and software platforms. Maintaining and upgrading our products to operate on multiple hardware and database platforms reduces our resources for developing new products. Because of the increased costs of developing and supporting softwareproducts across multiple platforms, we may need to reduce the number of those platforms. In addition, conflicting new technologies present us with difficult choices of which new technologies to adopt. If we fail to anticipate the most popularplatforms or fail to respond adequately to technological developments, or experience significant delays in product development or introduction, our business and operating results will be negatively impacted.  In addition, to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition andimplementation of such technologies may require us to make significant capital investments. We may not be able to obtain capital for these purposes and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable technological products. Theloss of revenue and increased costs to us from such changing technologies would adversely affect our business and operating results.  If our productsare not able to deliver quick, demonstrable value to our customers, our business could be seriously harmed.  Enterprises are requiringtheir application software vendors to provide faster times for a return of their investments on their technology investments. We must continue to improve the speed of our implementations and the pace at which our products deliver value or ourcompetitors may gain important strategic advantages over us. If we cannot successfully respond to these market demands, or if our competitors respond more successfully than we do, our business, results of operations and financial condition could bematerially and adversely affected.  If we do not maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments, our license andservices revenue could be adversely affected.  The markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change,evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We continuously evaluate new technologies and implement into our products advanced technology. However, if in our productdevelopment efforts we fail to accurately address, in a timely manner, evolving industry standards, new technology advancements or important third-party interfaces or product architectures, sales of our products and services will suffer. Market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible productlines. We can license our software products for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures. There may be future orexisting relational database platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace and that may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design. In addition, the effort and expense of developing, testing, and maintainingsoftware product lines will increase as more hardware platforms and operating systems achieve market acceptance within our target markets. Moreover, future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business applicationmarketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design. If we do not achieve market acceptance of new user interfaces that we support, or adapt to popular new user interfaces that we do not support, oursales and revenue may be adversely affected. Developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product releaseschedules, which could adversely affect revenues and results of operations.  We currently do not compete in the software on demand orapplication service provider markets.  Some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through hosted ondemand services or application service providers who distribute enterprise software through a hosted subscription service. We do not   34 Table of Contentscurrently have our own on demand hosting program for our products and have had limited success with channel partners who serve as applicationservice providers for customers. If these alternative distribution models gain popularity, we may not be able to compete effectively in this environment.  Our software products and product development are complex, which make it increasingly difficult to innovate, extend our product offerings, and avoid costs related to correction of program errors.  The market for our software products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements andfrequent new product introductions and enhancements. For instance, existing products can become obsolete and unmarketable when vendors introduce products utilizing new technologies or new industry standards emerge. As a result, it is difficult forus to estimate the life cycles of our software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to the market in a timely and cost-effective manner, or that products,capabilities or technologies developed by our competitors will not render our products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to:     continue to enhance and expand our core applications;     continue to sell our products;     continue to successfully integrate third-party products;     enter new markets and achieve market acceptance; and     develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, including developments related to the Internet, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customerrequirements and achieve market acceptance.  Despite testing by us, our software programs, like all software programsgenerally, may contain a number of undetected errors or bugs when we first introduce them or as new versions are released. We do not discover some errors until we have installed the product and our customers have used it. Errors mayresult in the delay or loss of revenues, diversion of software engineering resources, material non-monetary concessions, negative media attention, or increased service or warranty costs as a result of performance or warranty claims could lead tocustomer dissatisfaction, resulting in litigation, damage to our reputation, and impaired demand for our products. Correcting bugs may result in increased costs and reduced acceptance of our software products in the marketplace. The effort andexpense of developing, testing and maintaining software product lines will increase with the increasing number of possible combinations of:     vendor hardware platforms;     operating systems and updated versions;     application software products and updated versions; and     database management system platforms and updated versions  Developing consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our development resources and software product release schedules.  If the open source community expands into enterprise application software, our license fee revenues may decline.  The open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of software developers and individuals who have created a wide varietyof software and have made that software available for use, distribution and modification, often free of charge. Open source software, such as the Linux operating system, has been gaining in popularity among business users. If developers contributeenterprise application software to the open source community, and that software has competitive features and scale to support business   35 Table of Contentsusers in our markets, we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete successfully. Implementation of our products can be complex, time-consuming and expensive; customers may be unable to implement our products successfully and we may become subjectto warranty or product liability claims, which could be costly to resolve and result in negative publicity.  Our products must integratewith the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and may cause delays in the deployment of our products. Our customers may be unable to implement our productssuccessfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products. Although we test each of our new products and product enhancement releases and evaluate and test the products we obtain through acquisitions before introducing them to themarket, there may still be significant errors in existing or future releases of our software products, with the possible result that we may be required to expend significant resources in order to correct such errors or otherwise satisfy customerdemands. In addition, defects in our products or difficulty integrating our products with our customers systems could result in delayed or lost revenues, warranty or other claims against us by customers or third parties, adverse customerreaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services or reduced acceptance of our products and services in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.  Failure to maintain our margins and service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operatingperformance and financial condition.  A significant portion of our revenues is derived from implementation services. If we fail to scopeour implementation projects correctly, our services margins may suffer. Implementation services are predominately billed on an hourly or daily basis (time and materials) and sometimes under fixed price contracts. Implementation services billed on anhourly or daily basis and we generally recognize revenue from those services as work is performed. If we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services, without corresponding cost reductions, orif the percentage of fixed price contracts increases and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts, our operating performance may suffer. The rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors, including thefollowing:     perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services;     complexity of services performed;     competition;     pricing policies of our competitors and of systems integrators;     the use of globally sourced, lower-cost service delivery capabilities within our industry; and     economic, political and market conditions.  An increase in sales ofsoftware products that require customization would result in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract for those products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.  Historically, we have been able to recognize software license revenue upon delivery of our solutions and contract execution. Recently, more of ourcustomers and prospects have been asking for unique capabilities in addition to our core capabilities to give them a competitive edge in the market place. These instances could cause us to recognize more of our software license revenue on a contractaccounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution. The period between initial contact and the completion of the implementation of our products can be lengthy and is subject to a numberof factors (over many of which of which we have little or no control) that may cause significant delays. These factors include the   36 Table of Contentssize and complexity of the overall project. As a result, a shift toward a higher proportion of software license contracts requiring contract accounting wouldhave a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.  We sometimes experience delays in product releases, which can adversely affect our business.  Historically, we have issuedsignificant new releases of our software products periodically, with minor interim releases issued more frequently. As a result of the complexities inherent in our software, major new product enhancements and new products often require longdevelopment and testing periods before they are released. On occasion, we have experienced delays in the scheduled release date of new or enhanced products, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve future scheduled release dates. Thedelay of product releases or enhancements, or the failure of such products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance, could materially affect our business and reputation.  We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years.  Developing and localizing software is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related productopportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from theseinvestments for several years, if at all.  Our past and future acquisitions may not be successful and we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies. We have in the past acquired andinvested, and may continue to acquire or invest, in complementary companies, products and technologies, and enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and investmentspresent many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include:     the risk that the acquired company or assets may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the company or assets were worth;     the difficulty of assimilating the operations and retaining and motivating personnel of the combined companies;     the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;     the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns;     the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses;     adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate;     dilution of existing equity holders caused by capital stock issuances to the stockholders of acquired companies or stock option grants to retain employees of the acquired companies;    difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies;     potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;   37 Table of Contents  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers;     potential assumption of liabilities of our acquisition targets;     significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful; and     issues with product quality, product architecture, legal contingencies, product development issues, or other significant issues that may not be detected through our due diligenceprocess.  Recent changes in the law require the use of the purchase method of accounting in all new business acquisitions.The purchase method of accounting for business combinations may require large write-offs of any in-process research and development costs related to companies being acquired, as well as ongoing amortization costs for other intangible assets valuedin combinations of companies. In addition, we will need to periodically measure goodwill for impairment that may result in large future write-offs. Such write-offs and ongoing amortization charges may have a significant negative impact on operatingmargins and net earnings in the quarter of the combination and for several subsequent years. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such transactions.  There may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions.  We have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale. During weak economic conditions there is an increased risk that some of ourcustomers will file bankruptcy. When our customers file bankruptcy, we may be required to forego collection of pre-petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the 90-day preference period preceding the filing. Accountsreceivable balances related to pre-petition amounts may in some of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees, and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects. Thebankruptcy laws, as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy, may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition amounts, and may force us to disgorge payments made during the 90-day preference period. We also face risk frominternational customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions, in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict. Although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipatedcustomer bankruptcies, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate, and if they are not adequate, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.  Our international operations and sales subject us to risks associated with unexpected activities outside of the United States.  The global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition tothose experienced in locations within the United States. The following factors, among others, could have an adverse impact on our business and earnings:     failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, software localization requirements;    failure to properly comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services;     compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in Europe, Asia and North America, including export requirements, tariffs, import duties and other trade barriers,as well as health and safety requirements;     difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing;     longer collection cycles;     tariffs and other trade barriers;   38 Table of Contents  seasonal reductions in business activities, particularly throughout Europe;     reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;     proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;    anti-American sentiment due to the war with Iraq and other American policies that may be unpopular in certain countries;    increasing political instability, adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries;    difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;    fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets wherepayment for our products and services is made in the local currency;     changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate.     potential labor strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns and work stoppages at U.S. and international ports; and     restrictions on downsizing operations in Europe and expenses and delays associated with any such activities.  It may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance.  We contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities. In the current market, insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive, and when insurance coverage is offered, the deductible for whichwe are responsible is larger. In light of these circumstances, it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels, or if such coverage is available, the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially. This mayresult in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance, which could negatively impact our results of operations.  We have limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights and may potentially infringe third-party intellectual property rights.  We consider certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademarkand trade secret laws; confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties; and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in our license agreements with consultants, vendors, partners and customers and other measures toprotect this information. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. We believe that the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factorssuch as:     knowledge, ability and experience of our employees;     frequent software product enhancements;     customer education; and     timeliness and quality of support services.  Ourcompetitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. The laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be licensed do not protect our software products andintellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.   39 Table of ContentsWe generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, consultants,and vendors. These agreements control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products, obtainand use information that we regard as proprietary, or develop similar technology through reverse engineering or other means. Preventing or detecting unauthorized use of our products is difficult. There can be no assurances that the steps we takewill prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our license agreements will be enforceable. In addition, we may resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity andscope of others proprietary rights, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity in the future. Such litigation could result in significant costs or the diversion of resources. This could materially adversely affect our business,operating results and financial condition.  Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Although we do not believe that ourproducts infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert or prosecute infringement or invalidity claims against us. These assertions could distract management, require us to enter intoroyalty arrangements, and could result in costly and time consuming litigation, including damage awards. Such assertions or defense of such claims may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In addition,such assertions could result in injunctions against us. Injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. If third parties assert such claimsagainst us, we may seek to obtain a license to use such intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms.  We may experience liability claims arising out of the licensing of our software and provision of services.  Our agreements normally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. However, these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal, state, local or foreign laws orordinances. For example, we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance or the provision of services. If a claim against us were to be successful, we may be required to incur significant expense and paysubstantial damages. Even if we prevailed, the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our products and services.  Wealso rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with our internally developed software. Although these third parties generally indemnify us against claims that their technology infringes onthe proprietary rights of others, such indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property. Often such third-party indemnifiers are not well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event that theirtechnology infringes on the proprietary rights of others. As a result, we may face substantial exposure in the event that technology we license from a third-party infringes on another partys proprietary rights. Defending such infringementclaims, regardless of their validity, could result in significant cost and diversion of resources.  Concerns that our products do not adequately protectthe privacy of consumers could inhibit sales of our products.  One of the features of our software applications is the ability todevelop and maintain profiles of customers for use by businesses. Typically, these products capture profile information when customers and employees visit an Internet web site and volunteer information in response to survey questions concerningtheir backgrounds, interests and preferences. Our products augment these profiles over time by collecting usage data. Although we have designed our products to operate with applications that protect user privacy, privacy concerns may neverthelesscause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability. If we cannot adequately address customers privacy concerns, these concerns could seriously harm our business, financial condition andoperating results.   40 Table of ContentsWe face risks associated with the security of our products.  We have included security features in certain of our Internet browser-enabled products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customerdata. Despite these security features, our products may be vulnerable to break-ins and similar problems caused by Internet users. Such break-ins and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through thecomputer systems of our customers. Break-ins include such things as hackers bypassing firewalls and accessing confidential information. Addressing problems caused by such break-ins may have a material adverse effect on our business.  Although our license agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure as a result of the defects listed above, suchprovisions may not be effective. Existing or future Federal, state, or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions could affect their enforceability. To date, we have not experienced any such product liability claims, but there can beno assurance that this will not occur in the future. Because our products are used in essential business applications, a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financialcondition. Additionally, defending such a suit, regardless of its merits, could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management.  We may choose to change our business practices or our earnings will likely be affected as a result of changes in the requirements relating to the recent accounting pronouncement requiring expensing of equity instruments issued toemployees.  Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Achange in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the implementation of a new accounting principle.  We currently account for stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting forStock Issued to Employees and accordingly, we only record compensation expense related to stock options if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant. OnDecember 16, 2004, the FASB published FASB Statement No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment (FAS 123(R)) which was to be effective for public companies in periods beginning after June 15, 2005. On April 14,2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for FAS 123(R). The provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) require us to value equity instruments issued to employees andliability-classified awards at grant date fair value or based upon certain valuation methods that approximate grant date fair value, and to record those values as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We will be requiredto implement FAS 123(R) beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our earnings in fiscal 2007 will likely be significantly reduced as a result of changing our accounting policy in accordance with FAS 123(R). As a result, we could decide toreduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees. This could affect our ability to retain existing employees or attract qualified candidates, and increase the cash compensation we pay to employees. Sucha change could have a material effect on our operating performance.  Growth in our operations could increase demands on our managerial and operationalresources.  If the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers increasedramatically, it may increase demands on our management and operations. Our officers and other key employees will need to implement and improve our operational, customer support and financial control systems and effectively expand, train and manageour employee base.   41 Table of ContentsFurther, we may be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers andother third parties. We may not be able to manage future expansion successfully, and our inability to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.  Because our common stock and the common stock of our subsidiary, Logility, are publicly traded, we and Logility are subject to certain rules andregulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting OversightBoard, the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted recently by Congress, most notably theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention fromrevenue-generating activities to compliance activities.  In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firms audit of that assessment have required, and continue to require,the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available.This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.  If in the future we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of the then current fiscal year(or, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our managements report is fairly stated or they it is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting), wecould lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a negative market reaction  It may becomeincreasingly expensive to obtain and maintain insurance.  We obtain insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities. Inthe current market, insurance coverage has become more restrictive, and when insurance coverage is offered, the deductible for which we are responsible is larger and premiums have increased substantially. As a result, it may become more difficult tomaintain insurance coverage at historical levels, or if such coverage is available, the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially. This may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which wehave traditionally been covered by insurance, which could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition.  RISKS RELATED TOOUR STOCK PRICE  We could experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results that could adversely impact our stock price.  It is difficult to predict our revenues and operating results, which have varied widely from quarter to quarter in the past. We expect they will continueto vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We base our expense levels, operating costs and hiring plans on projections of future revenues, and it is difficult for us to rapidlyadjust when actual results do not match our projections. A failure to meet expectations of revenues could adversely affect the price of our stock. License revenues in any quarter depend substantially on the combined contracting activity of theAmerican Software group of companies and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue   42 Table of Contentsrecognition policies. Our contracting activity is difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons, including the following:     we complete a significant portion of our license agreements within the last few weeks of each quarter;     our sales cycle is relatively long and variable because of the complex and mission-critical nature of our products;     the size of our license transactions can vary significantly;     the possibility of adverse global political conditions and economic downturns, both domestic and international, characterized by decreased product demand, price erosion,technological shifts, work slowdowns and layoffs, may substantially reduce customer demand and contracting activity;     customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system evaluations and implementation due to changes in their strategic priorities, projectobjectives, budgetary constraints, internal purchasing processes or company management;     customer evaluations and purchasing processes vary from company to company, and a customers internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and timeconsuming, even after selection of a vendor; and     the number, timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and by our competitors may affect purchase decisions. Variances or slowdowns in our licensing activity in prior quarters may affect current and future consulting, training andmaintenance revenues since these revenues typically follow license fee revenues. Our ability to maintain or increase services revenues primarily depends on our ability to increase the number and size of our licensing agreements. In addition, we baseour budgeted operating costs and hiring plans primarily on our projections of future revenues. Because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term, if our actual revenues fall below projections in any particular quarter, our business,operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Our stock price is volatile and there is a risk of litigation. The trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors suchas the following:     revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community;     reduced investor confidence in equity markets, due in part to corporate collapses in recent years;     speculation in the press or analyst community;     wide fluctuations in stock prices, particularly with respect to the stock prices for other technology companies;     announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;     new products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors;     developments with respect to our copyrights or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;     changes in interest rates;     changes in investors beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors;     changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other software companies;   43 Table of Contents  changes in management;     sales of common stock by our controlling stockholders, directors and executive officers;     rumors or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination methods;    conditions and trends in the software industry generally;     the announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;     adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;     general market conditions;     domestic or international terrorism and other factors; and     the other factors described in these Risk Factors
.  Fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed inthe future, there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock. Defending against such suits could result in substantial cost and divert managements attention and resources. In addition, anysettlement or adverse determination of such lawsuits could subject us to significant liability.  Our principal shareholders may control our managementdecisions.  James C. Edenfield, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas L. Newberry, Chairman of the Board of Directors, own100% of our outstanding Class B common stock between them, giving them the right to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. Mr. Edenfield and Dr. Newberry have reported in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that theyconstitute a group, for voting purposes. Current directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 7.4% of our Class A common stock. Mr. Edenfield, Dr. Newberry and members of their immediate familiescurrently constitute four of the eight members of the Board and, thus, have significant influence in directing the actions of the Board of Directors and all other matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the approval of mergers andother business combinations.  Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.  Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of ourcommon stock to decline. Current directors and executive officers of the Company as a group beneficially own approximately 7.4% of our Class A common stock as of June 30, 2006. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the publicmarket by these persons, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.  Both the Company and our subsidiary, Logility, are controlled companies within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on,exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.  Because the Company is controlled by its Class B shareholders who act as agroup, and the Company controls a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Logility, both the Company and Logility are controlled companies within the meaning of the rules governing companies with stock quoted onThe NASDAQ National Market. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a controlled company and is exempt from certain corporate governancerequirements, including requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of   44 Table of Contentsindependent directors, (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors orby a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely ofindependent directors. The Companys and Logilitys Boards of Directors do not have a majority of independent directors, and their compensation committees are not required to consist entirely of independent directors. Neither the CompanyBoard nor the Logility Board is required to have a nominating committee, and they have not chosen to establish nominating committees. According, the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions for the Company and for Logility are notsubject to the same corporate governance requirements as non-controlled companies with stock quoted on The NASDAQ National Market.   "
