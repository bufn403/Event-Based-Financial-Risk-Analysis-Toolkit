BUSINESS  When used in this report, unless otherwise indicated, “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” and “Kodak” refer to the consolidated company on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Kodak is a global manufacturer focused on commercial print and advanced materials and chemicals. With 79,000 patents earned over 130 years of research and development (""R&D""), Kodak believes in the power of technology and science to enhance what the world sees and creates. Kodak's innovative, award-winning products, combined with its customer-first approach, make us the partner of choice for commercial printers worldwide. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship, including industry leadership in developing sustainable solutions for print. The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSKodak’s operations are classified into three reportable segments: Print, Advanced Materials and Chemicals, and Brand. The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park (""EBP"") operations. PrintThe Print segment is comprised of five lines of business: the Prepress Solutions business, the PROSPER business, the Software business, the Electrophotographic Printing Solutions business and the Versamark business.  Print segment products include digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions, high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology, production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components, software and services.  The Print segment serves a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging/labels. Print products are sold to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers and channel partners.  Key competitors are Fuji, EC03, HP, Canon, Ricoh and Screen. Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below. This segment is experiencing challenges from higher raw material and other supply chain costs and competitive pricing pressures. Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities and challenges related to the Print segment. • Prepress Solutions:   • The Prepress Solutions business provides digital offset plate offerings and CTP imaging solutions.   • The goal of Prepress Solutions is to pursue a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm. Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The offset printing process transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.         3     Table of Contents  • The Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. Instead of the traditional process in which a plate is run through processing equipment containing a solution of developer, chemicals and water to set the image, KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates enable printers to set the image on the platesetter, then go directly to press. Processing variability is eliminated, so process-free plate users benefit from more consistent and stable plates.  The solution is designed to be a much more environmentally friendly approach that could eliminate all processing chemicals, water and excess energy and waste from the plate-making process. These plates are designed to deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.   • On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China. The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement for HuaGuang to help Kodak fulfill customer demand; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology, including its Sonora Process Free plates technology, to HuaGuang with the intent of expanding the plates market in China. The term of the supply agreement expires in the third quarter of 2024.  • PROSPER:   • The PROSPER business product offerings include PROSPER press systems and PROSPER components, based on KODAK’s Continuous Inkjet Technologies KODAK Stream and ULTRASTREAM, along with KODACHROME and KODAK EKTACOLOR Inks and KODAK OPTIMAX Primers. Examples include the PROSPER 7000 Turbo Press and the PROSPER ULTRA 520 Press, which is powered by ULTRASTREAM, Kodak’s 4th generation inkjet technology, which Kodak believes delivers exceptional quality at the fastest speeds, even on the most demanding jobs with heavy ink coverage on glossy and coated papers.    •In addition to Kodak-branded presses, PROSPER print head components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner products and systems. Applications include publishing, commercial print, direct mail, packaging, and décor. The modular and scalable design of print heads powered by our ULTRASTREAM inkjet technology facilitates integration in print widths from 104 – 2500 mm (4” – 98”) for applications on paper, film, plastic, and other substrates, expanding the footprint of inkjet printing to take on the challenges of a new age of digital printing.  •Sales of PROSPER presses and components result in recurring revenue from sales of KODACHROME and KODAK EKTACOLOR Inks and KODAK OPTIMAX Primers and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage. Kodak also generates revenue through the sale of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service.  •  Software:    •  The Software business offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak products and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output. Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries. Kodak added its cloud-based PRINERGY On Demand Platform to its PRINERGY offerings in 2022.    •  The Software business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency.         4     Table of Contents  •  Electrophotographic Printing Solutions:   • NEXFINITY printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products.   • Kodak ceased manufacturing of NEXFINITY printers effective December 2022.  Kodak will continue to offer ink and other consumables as well as provide service to its installed base of printers.   •  Versamark:    •  The KODAK VERSAMARK products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER business. Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press Systems. Users of KODAK VERSAMARK products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak. Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.  Net sales for the Prepress business accounted for 56%, 59% and 57% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Advanced Materials and Chemicals The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment is comprised of four lines of business: the Industrial Film and Chemicals business, the Motion Picture business, the Advanced Materials and Functional Printing business and the IP Licensing and Analytical Services business. Kodak’s Advanced Materials and Chemicals products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. Kodak Alaris, a professional and consumer still photographic film and chemicals customer, represented approximately 34% of total Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment revenues in 2023 and 32% in both 2022 and 2021. Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below. The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment includes the Kodak Research Laboratories which conduct research, develop new product or new business opportunities such as Kodak's growth initiatives of printed electronics, light blocking treatment for fabrics and diagnostic test reagents and file patent applications for its inventions and innovations.  The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment also manages licensing of its intellectual property to third parties and is a supporting participant for any licensing of Kodak intellectual property to a third party.  Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.  •  Industrial Film and Chemicals:    •  Offers professional and consumer still photographic film, as well as industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards.    •  Includes related component businesses: Specialty Chemicals; Solvent Recovery; and Polyester Film. Specialty Chemicals include unregulated key starting materials (“KSMs”) for pharmaceuticals. Kodak intends to continue organic expansion of its KSM production and is exploring opportunities to further expand its pharmaceutical offerings.  Specialty Chemicals also includes materials for batteries (e.g., electric vehicles (""EV"") and others) and specific functional materials for personal care products.    •  Offers specialty inks and dispersions to third parties.    •  Offers coating and product commercialization services: offerings include both pilot-scale and production scale roll-to-roll coating capabilities utilizing Kodak’s assets and know-how to commercialize and manufacture third-party products.  This includes the growth initiative for coated substrates for components used in cell and battery pack assembly.         5     Table of Contents  •  Motion Picture:    •  Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers.    •  Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offer onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe.   •  Advanced Materials and Functional Printing:    •  Advanced Materials develops solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories. There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category, one of which is light blocking particles for black out window treatments.  The commercialization of the black out window treatments is complete including a coated textile production facility in Eastman Business Park.  A second application is a specialized functional film being manufactured for use by a 3D printing customer.  A third application is the process development work for launching Kodak’s diagnostic test reagents as preparation for the opening of a cGMP facility within an existing building at Eastman Business Park to manufacture regulated pharmaceutical materials for healthcare applications.    •  Functional Printing concentrates on contract manufacturing, development partnerships, and/or licensing opportunities in very high-resolution micro-3D printing solutions such as printed electronics and printed transparent antennas. Development partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak’s efforts to further develop such technologies into products. Also, a portfolio of products is offered to enable others to utilize functional printing.   •  IP Licensing and Analytical Services:    •  Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses. While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses. Kodak also provides a wide range of analytical services to external clients at competitive rates.  Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities related to Advanced Materials and Chemicals growth initiatives. Net sales for Industrial Film and Chemicals business accounted for 18%, 15% and 14% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. BrandThe Brand segment includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties. Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including digital, instant print and 35mm film cameras, printing and scanning consumer use devices, eyewear, batteries and apparel. Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their own products and use their own distribution channels.        6     Table of Contents RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available. Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing largely based on prevailing market prices for aluminum. Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices. The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers. While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components, other components and specialty chemicals included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks. Refer to Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" and the Executive Overview section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for a discussion of the impact of the economic environment and other global events for additional information. SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSPrinting equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products. Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; key press components and toners for color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; and security materials.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance. In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well, such as color negative films, processing and print films, and manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry. Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent. Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates along with know-how and trade secrets. There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Kodak is subject to a wide variety of increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control. A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to Kodak’s operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on operations, cash flows or financial condition, Kodak does not currently anticipate material expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Kodak is focused on developing and delivering products and technologies that can drive sustainability and profitability by increasing operational efficiency, minimizing resource use, reducing costs over time and empowering customers to meet their own sustainability objectives. The opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of its products and services is especially great for print products, as commercial printing has historically been a significant source of waste and pollution. Kodak continues to develop in-house life cycle assessment and carbon footprint capabilities, which will help identify where the environmental footprint of Kodak’s products can be further reduced.        7     Table of Contents HUMAN CAPITALAs of the end of 2023, Kodak employed approximately 4,000 employees across 34 countries. Kodak’s success depends on identifying, attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas within Kodak. Outside the U.S. there are employees in certain countries that are represented by unions or similar organizations, such as works councils, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Kodak utilizes temporary staffing programs to develop a pipeline of talent and provide additional support during peak periods. This includes working closely with local schools to provide apprentice and intern programs.  Less than 2% of its workforce is temporary. Diversity, Equity and InclusionKodak seeks to create an inclusive and creative environment globally. Kodak strives to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in its talent practices, and invest in and engage with its communities. Kodak conducts diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. Kodak has achieved a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for over two decades and is included on its list of “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality”. Health, Wellness and SafetyKodak is dedicated to driving continuous safety improvement across its operations. Kodak’s approach includes identifying and mitigating risk, targeted training, information sharing on safe work practices, and thorough analysis of incidents and near misses, implementing preventative measures and performing reviews to ensure the hazard has been eliminated. AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.

The risk factors described below, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in our securities risky. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Summary of Risk Factors
 The following is a summary of the risk factors Kodak faces. The list is not exhaustive, and investors should read this “Risk Factors
” section in full. Some of the risks Kodak faces include:        8     Table of Contents Summary of Risks Related to Kodak’s Business and Operations   ●  Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global economic and geopolitical conditions, including wars and other hostilities, medical epidemics, inflation, rising interest rates, and slowdowns in customer demand.    ●  The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate our business.     ●  If Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which we are focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, Kodak’s financial performance could be adversely affected.     ●  If Kodak is unable to successfully or timely implement cost structure reductions, Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.     ●  The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.    ●  If Kodak cannot effectively

that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.  ●If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.  ●Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.  ●Failure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted.   ●  If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.     ●  Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.     ●  Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition.     ●  Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.          9     Table of Contents   ●  Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.     ●  Kodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations.     ●  An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.   Summary of Risks Related to Kodak’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets   ●  The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow to be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.     ●  The availability of letters of credit under the Amended and Restated Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (""Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement"") is limited by the amount of cash on deposit with the administrative agent.     ●  Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.     ●  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.     ●  The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.   Summary of Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks   ●  Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.    ● Our business and financial condition can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.   ●  Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.     ●  Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     ●  If Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.    ●  Kodak may have additional tax liabilities.     ●  Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.     ●  Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our trade name and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.          10     Table of Contents Summary of Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock    ●  The conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.     ●  The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.    ●  The resale of the Company’s common stock may adversely affect the price of our common stock.    ●  The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.    ●  The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.  Risks Related to Kodak’s Business and Operations Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global economic and geopolitical conditions, including the impact of wars and other hostilities, medical epidemics, inflation, rising interest rates, and slowdowns in customer demand. Worsening global economic conditions, including those associated with the war in Ukraine, the conflicts involving Israel, medical epidemics, heightened levels of inflation and rising interest rates, could have material adverse impacts on Kodak’s business, cash flows, employees, suppliers, customers, and others’ ability to conduct business, including increased operational costs, extended business shutdowns, reduced operations, restrictions or interruptions in shipping, manufacturing or installing products, reduced consumer demand and the reduced ability of our customers to make payments. Accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers’ ability to pay, and our liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. Due to the global economic impact of the war in Ukraine, the conflicts involving Israel, medical epidemics, heightened levels of inflation and rising interest rates, we have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased cost of energy, shipping, raw materials and labor, limited availability of raw materials and component products, delays in shipping and transportation and a decline in customer demand. Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have significantly increased, and could continue to increase. Ongoing disruptions in our supply chain could affect our ability to continue to meet customer demand for our products and services.  Continued or worsening operational and global economic conditions could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The extent to which the global economic conditions affect our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.  This includes new information which may emerge concerning the continued impact of the war in Ukraine and the conflicts involving Israel, any escalation thereof, and the impact of the international response thereto.  For additional discussion regarding known impacts of the war in Ukraine, the conflicts involving Israel and the global economic environment, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations“ in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.        11     Table of Contents The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate our business.  Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing Kodak’s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Kodak has not consistently generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with financing and monetization transactions over the past several years. Kodak's businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow. It may take Kodak longer than planned to generate consistent positive cash flow from operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations for an extended period in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations, our ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited. Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances:   •  Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;   •  Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;   •  Kodak will meet all conditions associated with borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement;   •  Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth or operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan;   •  Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or   •  Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs.  Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the senior secured first lien term loans (the “Term Loans”) borrowed under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated June 30, 2023, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Lenders”), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as Administrative Agent (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), the 4.0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and the 5.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, collateral requirements, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements. If Kodak cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce our ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs.        12     Table of Contents If Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which we are focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, Kodak’s financial performance could be adversely affected.  Kodak has focused our investments in print, advanced materials, and chemicals. These investment areas include digital printing using commercial inkjet, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals (including pharmaceutical and reagent products), coated materials used in electric vehicle/energy storage batteries and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, Kodak’s strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that Kodak’s ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing our investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, Kodak’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected. If Kodak is unable to successfully or timely implement cost structure reductions, Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.  Kodak continues to rationalize our workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with our business initiatives. There are no assurances that workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures will be successful or the cost savings or other beneficial results will be consistent with expectations. The extent of change across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to diminished results, compliance issues, and harm to our reputation. If workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures are not effectively managed, Kodak may also experience lost sales, harm to our business and customer relationships, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees or other retention issues, product delays and increased costs. Finally, the timing and implementation of workforce reductions may require compliance with laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact Kodak’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business. In order to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees across the Company. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, is critical to our future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. Given that our business is highly technical and specialized, it would be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key employees. Kodak may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect Kodak’s business and results of operations.        13     Table of Contents If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate or rapidly respond to technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.  Kodak generally sells our products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Kodak’s success depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To do so, Kodak must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. Kodak’s customers may decide to outsource their imaging and printing needs or may purchase imaging and printing services from other suppliers in order to meet their needs. In addition, it is difficult to always successfully anticipate the products and services our customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If Kodak does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to our current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of our competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to our competitors, which could adversely affect our product roadmaps and associated revenue streams. Kodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities. If our investment in research and product development is inadequate, our response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services. Kodak’s investment in new products and services may not achieve expected returns.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, manufacturing capability, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting our revenue. That may mean Kodak does not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue. If Kodak does not manage product reliability, yield and quality, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.  In developing, commercializing, manufacturing and servicing our products and services, Kodak must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.        14     Table of Contents Aging manufacturing facilities and equipment could lead to failures of equipment and systems and require capital investment. Kodak’s manufacturing facilities are aged, and without significant updates to equipment and systems, will be more prone to failure. Capital improvements to manufacturing facilities are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology.  The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base. If Kodak’s equipment and systems experience a critical failure, we could experience an interruption of operations, manufacturing delays, increased costs associated with repairs or redesigns of systems and products, loss of sales and customers and damage to Kodak’s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Kodak fails to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.  Kodak uses a variety of distribution methods to sell and deliver our products and services, including direct sales, third-party resellers, channel partners and distributors. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels across customer segments for our products and services is complex. Since each distribution method has distinct risks and financial implications, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and earnings. If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.  A key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, some of Kodak’s businesses and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all. Kodak also licenses third parties to use our trademarks. In an effort to preserve our trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of our trademarks and requires our licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be diluted and our reputation harmed by our licensees’ activities. Also, failure by Kodak and our licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of our trademark rights.  Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of our licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue. In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct our business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios. Third parties may claim Kodak and our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.        15     Table of Contents Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like Kodak. Even if we believe the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business:   •  claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources;   •  claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products;   •  even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and   •  if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, Kodak’s revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.  Finally, Kodak uses open-source software in connection with some of our products and services. Companies which incorporate open-source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source software and/or compliance with open-source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. Some open-source software licenses require users who distribute open-source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition. Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.  To effectively manage our global business, Kodak depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.  Attacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Therefore, the system controls and security measures Kodak and other third parties use to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents may not be sufficient to anticipate and identify these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks, breaches or defects in our systems or those of third parties could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s business and reputation. The speed to closure of significant cyber security incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies, which is outside of our control. Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to our customers and operates services used by our customers and hosted by Kodak. A breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers’ operations or data privacy, which could expose Kodak to liability and reputational harm. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by cyber-attacks or data security incidents in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of customers’ business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, any of which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Kodak is implementing improvements to IT systems to more effectively manage our global business and implement our strategic plans. If Kodak is unable to successfully manage the development, improvement and transition of IT systems, anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements may be delayed or diminished, and we may experience cost overruns, disruption in our operations, or other business or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.16Table of Contents Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.  From time to time, Kodak may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to successfully pursue strategic transactions, Kodak must identify suitable sellers, buyers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. Strategic transactions may involve the following risks and challenges that could negatively impact our results of operations:   •  the need to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;   •  the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our business;   •  potential loss of key employees;   •  difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond our control;   •  wrong, inaccurate, or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated;   •  potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas;   •  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;   •  competition for strategic transactions, which may increase transaction costs and the ability to identify opportunities;   •  management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and   •  the possibility we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.  There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which we undertake or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins and profitability.         If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.  Kodak’s products and brand have worldwide recognition. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of our brand, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers, distributors, channel partners, consumers and investors. Any harm to the reputation of Kodak or our brand could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial condition. The value of Kodak’s brand is reflected, in part, in our Brand segment, which licenses the Kodak brand for use by third parties in a wide range of products. Consumers and the public may view the products and activities of brand licensees as the products and activities of Kodak. The measures Kodak undertakes to research and manage licensee relationships and assess the quality of their products may not be sufficient to protect against legal proceedings and reputational harm in the event that licensed products and services do not meet consumer expectations for quality and safety. Other factors that could dilute or damage the reputation of Kodak and our brand include the failure of products and services to meet customer expectations, litigation and government investigations, negative or inaccurate comments in the media, including social media, and failure to meet and manage customer and industry expectations regarding the impact of our business on matters of social responsibility and environmental sustainability.        16     Table of Contents Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.  The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may:   •  foresee the course of market developments more accurately than Kodak does;   •  sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services;   •  have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost;   •  have better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost;   •  develop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers;   •  adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements; or   •  have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms.  As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels which would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue, gross margins and cash flow. Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition.  Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages or outages, internet, systems and telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, failure of critical infrastructure, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, including war and protests, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could cause disruptions to Kodak’s operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers and have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition.        17     Table of Contents Certain of Kodak’s critical business functions, including our manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak’s employees to physically work at our or our customers’ locations due to disruptions in service could harm Kodak’s operations, perhaps significantly. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, both Kodak and our customers could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of customers’ business, and unfavorable impact to business reputation, as a result of which there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.  Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services, many of which are unique, to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations. To the extent we rely on third parties, we face the risks that those third parties may not be able to:   •  Obtain supplies and materials necessary to deliver goods or services to Kodak;   •  Mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions;   •  Develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products;   •  Maintain an adequate control environment; and   •  Quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products.  Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service and supply as a result of unexpected demand, product obsolescence, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of our products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce our contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, interruption of IT services, risks related to the duration and termination of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials, non-competitive pricing due to tariffs, and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. Hardware, applications and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party suppliers may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be available or established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition. Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity. There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.        18     Table of Contents Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.  As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all of our segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Kodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations.  Kodak’s business is subject to additional costs and risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:   •  support of multiple languages;   •  recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;   •  compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;   •  complexity of managing international operations;   •  exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;   •  commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.;   •  multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;   •  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;   •  limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash and the potential obligation to move cash to locations limiting or restricting repatriation;   •  limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;   •  complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and   •  political or economic instability.  As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact. An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.  The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.        19     Table of Contents Risks Related to Kodak’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow to be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.  The Company has obligations for borrowed money or in connection with letters of credit under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the cash collateralized Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement (together, the “Credit Agreements”). The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in our securities. These include the following:  •  Kodak may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt Kodak may have incurred;   •  We could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, collateral requirements, refinancing or other purposes;   •  We will have to use a significant part of our cash flow or cash balances to make payments on our debt and Series B Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and   •  Adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.  The Company cannot be sure cash generated from our businesses will be as high as we expect, or our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our businesses or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect Kodak’s ability to fund our operations. The availability of letters of credit under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement is limited by the amount of cash on deposit. Availability under the Company’s Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement is based on cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 104% of the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at any given time (the “L/C Cash Collateral”). If L/C Cash Collateral is not maintained to support the 104% of the $31 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement, the Company would be required to place additional cash on deposit with the administrative agent within one business day of a demand. Additional cash would also be required to be deposited if Kodak desires to have additional letters of credit issued. Additional L/C Cash Collateral would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs. Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.  Kodak may desire to raise additional capital, including to pursue additional growth opportunities, strategic transactions or additional reorganization initiatives or refinance or redeem outstanding debt or preferred stock. Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or the current volatility and tightening in the financial and credit markets, Kodak’s access to the capital markets may be limited.  Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:   •  Covenants in the Credit Agreements;   •  Obtaining a consent from the holders of Series B and C Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series B and C Preferred Stock;         20     Table of Contents   •  Investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which we operate;   •  Our financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of our subsidiaries;   •  Our levels of debt and redemption obligations;   •  Our ability to generate positive cash flow;   •  Our ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales;   •  Our requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;   •  Our current non-investment grade credit rating;   •  Our long-term business prospects; and   •  General economic and capital market conditions.  Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to capitalize on growth or efficiency opportunities or refinancings we would otherwise like to pursue. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.  A breach of any of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreements could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any default or event of default occurs under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement, the administrative agent under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the agent under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, such holders may declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If applicable, the administrative agent under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement and the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.  The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances our credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies. Our credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. In carrying out our commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business.        21     Table of Contents Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Legal proceedings and governmental investigations associated with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announcement or in general could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. On July 28, 2020, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (the “DFC”) announced (the “DFC Announcement”) the signing of a non-binding letter of interest to provide a subsidiary of the Company with a potential $765 million loan (the “DFC Loan”) to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, an initiative that would manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients for essential generic drugs (the “DFC Pharmaceutical Project”). The DFC Announcement and circumstances surrounding it prompted congressional investigations, an SEC investigation and a New York Attorney General’s investigation. In addition, lawsuits have been filed or threatened alleging various securities law violations and breaches of fiduciary duties based on circumstances surrounding the DFC Announcement. For further information on these investigations and lawsuits, see Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Financial Statements. Legal proceedings in general, and securities, class action and patent infringement litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. The investigations and lawsuits associated with the DFC announcement have diverted, and may continue to divert, the attention of Kodak’s employees, management and board of directors. In addition, the response to the DFC related investigations and lawsuits has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased legal expense and related costs. Kodak’s insurance, to the extent maintained, is not expected to cover all costs associated with the investigations and legal proceedings. We are unable to predict how much longer the legal proceedings and investigations to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any governmental investigation or legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or stock price. Our business and financial condition can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners. Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Such laws govern payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree.        22     Table of Contents Kodak has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including worldwide system screening of all customers, suppliers and vendors, banking entities, sales orders, and purchase orders.  Kodak periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of our policies and procedures, including sanctioned parties listings used in screening its master and transactional data as well as export license and license exception determination routines. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, agents or business partners will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately deemed responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant losses as a victim and legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.  If Kodak is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.  Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. Examples of data privacy laws include (but are not limited to) the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and ePrivacy laws, California’s Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other U.S. state privacy laws, China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”). These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. Additionally, the application of existing and new laws in the areas of cloud services and artificial intelligence is evolving, and we may face challenges monitoring and complying with these requirements.  Failure to comply with existing and newly enacted laws and regulations that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. We may also face risk (including loss of substantial business) if our customers and other stakeholders are not confident that our products and service can be used in a manner that is compliant with applicable data protection laws. Recent developments in the regulation of cross-border data transfers from the European Economic Area and countries with similar regimes, including enforcement decisions and regulatory guidance issued by key supervisory authorities, creates uncertainty as to our and our customers’ ability to use platforms and processing services located in the U.S. and other non-adequate jurisdictions. While existing data transfer mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses, remain valid, Kodak’s use of these transfer mechanisms is subject to legal, regulatory and political pressure. Kodak anticipates spending additional time and expense to enable continued cross-border transfers as needed to operate our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. This environment demands Kodak continuously improve our design and coordination of privacy and security controls (including within our products, websites and business processes) and contractual arrangements across our businesses and geographies. While Kodak has taken steps to comply with applicable data protection laws and the regulations and guidance published by applicable regulators, our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance may not be sufficient or fully successful. Despite Kodak’s security controls over personal data, Kodak, may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of our products. Changes to such laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, limit the sale of certain of our products in certain jurisdictions or require modifications to our products that may be costly, time consuming or infeasible.        23     Table of Contents Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak’s properties may impact our ability to further develop or sell such properties. If Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities. Kodak is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”. The existence of a material weakness in Kodak’s internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s business, financial condition, cash flow results of operations or the trading price of Kodak’s stock. Kodak may have additional tax liabilities.  We earn our income in both in the U.S. and abroad and, as such, are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions can impact these tax laws.  Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how Kodak is taxed on its global earnings.  In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted in the U.S. and introduced a 15% alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations (“CAMT”).  This became effective January 1, 2023. There is no impact on our provision for income taxes from the CAMT for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") has led efforts to devise, and to permanently implement, a two-pillar solution to global tax challenges.  These pillars focus on global profit allocations and provide for a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15%.   A number of countries have enacted or are proposing to enact legislation that aligns with the directives set forth in the two-pillar solution; many of which are effective for the 2024 year.  These changes could increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate and cash flow.   Management reviews regularly the adequacy of the provisions for taxes as they relate to Kodak’s income and transactions. In order to assess uncertain tax positions, Kodak applies a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition.   Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.  Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.        24     Table of Contents In past years, Kodak has experienced variability in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including variability in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and benefits. There can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting cost increases. Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our trade name and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Kodak tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, if there are significant changes in the discount rate or royalty rates, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock  The conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.  The 1,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 9.5238 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock and the 1,138,443 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 10 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock. The outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are expected to increase as a result of the payment of dividends. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Convertible Securities”), the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the conversion of all Convertible Securities would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock. If Convertible Securities are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Securities will be a dilution to dividends and distributions. Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Securities or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock owns a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities and has nominated one member of the Company’s Board. An affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s Board and holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will have such right in the event dividends are in arrears.  As a result, these parties may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board. The holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock holds approximately 13% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, this holder may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.        25     Table of Contents The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock had the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), which right has expired; however, the individual nominated by the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to this right continues to serve as a member of the Board. If dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one additional director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been paid or declared. This nomination right expires if the holder ceases to directly or indirectly hold at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or the common stock received upon the conversion of such shares and is exclusive to the initial holder and does not transfer with the Series C Preferred Stock. Also, an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Board until the date on which the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least $200 million of the original principal amount of the Term Loans.  Also, if dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside. As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holder of Series C Preferred Stock or an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders or nominated in the future by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would enable such holders and lenders to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board. The Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of our outstanding securities. The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In compliance with certain agreements to which the Company is a party, we have registered the resale of an aggregate of up to 41,333,435 shares of common stock that are either outstanding or issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock. The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the certain agreements to which the Company is subject, certain of the counterparties to such agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of our common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected. The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes. Holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock collectively have a significant influence over matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of such securities collectively would be able to cause a significant change in the ownership of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions in securities of the Company which have already occurred or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially. Certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s outstanding securities not involving these holders, could also cause such an “ownership change”. For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 17, “Income Taxes”. The interests of the holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of the Company’s common stock experienced extreme volatility in the context of the DFC Announcement and has declined significantly since that time. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations, sales of large blocks of our common stock and developments concerning the investigations, lawsuits and claims relating to the DFC Announcement, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.        26     Table of Contents      "

BUSINESS  When used in this report, unless otherwise indicated, “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” and “Kodak” refer to the consolidated company on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Kodak is a global manufacturer focused on commercial print and advanced materials and chemicals. Kodak provides industry-leading hardware, software, consumables and services primarily to customers in commercial print, packaging, publishing, manufacturing and entertainment. With 31,000 patents earned over 130 years of R&D, we believe in the power of technology and science to enhance what the world sees and creates. Our innovative, award-winning products, combined with our customer-first approach, allow us to attract customers worldwide. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship, including industry leadership in developing sustainable solutions for print. The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSKodak’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Traditional Printing, Digital Printing, Advanced Materials and Chemicals and Brand. The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park (""EBP"") operations. Traditional Printing The Traditional Printing segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions. The Traditional Printing segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging. This segment is experiencing challenges from higher raw material and other supply chain costs, digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures. Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities and challenges related to Traditional Printing. The goal of Prepress Solutions is to pursue a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm. Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates. The Traditional Printing products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers and channel partners. Kodak’s primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa. Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which may strengthen demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions. Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. Instead of the traditional process in which a plate is run through processing equipment containing a solution of developer, chemicals and water to set the image, KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates enable printers to set the image on the platesetter, then go directly to press. There’s also no processing variability, so process-free plate users benefit from more consistent and stable plates.  It’s designed to be a much more environmentally friendly approach that could eliminate all processing chemicals, water and excess energy and waste from the plate-making process. These plates are designed to deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.        3     Table of Contents Net sales for Traditional Printing accounted for 59%, 57% and 58% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Traditional Printing segment also provides service and support related to these products. On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China. The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement for HuaGuang to help Kodak fulfill customer demand; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology, including its Sonora Process Free plates technology, to HuaGuang with the intent of expanding the plates market in China.  As part of the arrangement, Kodak established an escrow in China to secure minimum payments required under the supply agreement. The escrow balance as of December 31, 2022 approximated $5 million. Digital Printing The Digital Printing segment contains PROSPER, Software, Electrophotographic Printing Solutions and Versamark.  Digital Printing products include high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology, production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components, software and services. Digital Printing products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. The markets that the Digital Printing segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels. Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh and Screen. Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below. • Prosper:   • The PROSPER business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging on a variety of substrates. PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage. The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service.   • The focus of the PROSPER business is on developing innovative solutions for customers which includes Kodak’s next generation inkjet platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in OEM products and systems as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.   •  Software:    •  The Software business offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak products and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output. Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with over 15,000 systems installed in some of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world. Kodak added its cloud-based PRINERGY On Demand Platform to its PRINERGY offerings in 2022.    •  The Software business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency.         4     Table of Contents  •  Electrophotographic Printing Solutions:   • NEXFINITY printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products.   • The ASCEND printer is a new electrophotographic press aimed at the retail, point of purchase and packaging markets. ASCEND printers enable customers to print and embellish on heavyweight stocks and are designed for customers looking to create short-run packaging, displays and signage.    • Kodak has ceased manufacturing of NEXFINITY and ASCEND printers effective December 2022.  Kodak will continue to offer ink and other consumables as well as provide service to its installed base of printers.   •  Versamark:    •  The KODAK VERSAMARK products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER business. Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press Systems. Users of KODAK VERSAMARK products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak. Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.  Net sales for Digital Printing accounted for 19%, 22% and 23% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Advanced Materials and Chemicals The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment is comprised of three lines of business: Industrial Film and Chemicals, Motion Picture and Advanced Materials and Functional Printing. Kodak Services for Business (“KSB”), which provided business process outsourcing services, was sold to Swiss Post Solutions in December 2020. Kodak’s Advanced Materials and Chemicals products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. Kodak Alaris, a professional and consumer still photographic film and chemicals customer, represented approximately 32% of total Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment revenues in both 2022 and 2021 and 30% in 2020. Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below. The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment includes the Kodak Research Laboratories which conduct research, develop new product or new business opportunities such as Kodak's growth initiatives of printed electronics, light blocking treatment for fabrics and diagnostic test reagents and file patent applications for its inventions and innovations.  The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment also manages licensing of its intellectual property to third parties and is a supporting participant for any licensing of Kodak intellectual property to a third party.  Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.  •  Industrial Film and Chemicals:    •  Offers professional and consumer still photographic film, as well as industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards.         5     Table of Contents   •  Includes related component businesses: Specialty Chemicals; Solvent Recovery; and Polyester Film. Specialty Chemicals include unregulated key starting materials (“KSMs”) for pharmaceuticals. Kodak intends to continue organic expansion of its KSM production and is exploring opportunities to further expand its pharmaceutical offerings.  Specialty Chemicals also includes specialty materials for batteries (e.g., electric vehicles (""EV"") and others) and specific functional materials for personal care products.    •  Offers specialty inks and dispersions to third parties.    •  Offers coating and product commercialization services: offerings include both pilot-scale and production scale roll-to-roll coating capabilities utilizing Kodak’s assets and know-how to commercialize and manufacture third-party products.   •  Motion Picture:    •  Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers.    •  Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offer onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe.   •  Advanced Materials and Functional Printing:    •  Advanced Materials develops solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories. There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category. Currently, the primary focus is on light blocking particles (Kodalux) for the textile market. In addition, a specialty material is manufactured by this group for use by a 3D printing customer.    •  Functional Printing concentrates on contract manufacturing, development partnerships, and/or licensing opportunities in very high-resolution micro-3D printing solutions such as printed electronics and printed transparent antennas. Development partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak’s efforts to further develop such technologies into products. Also, a portfolio of products is offered to enable others to utilize functional printing.   •  IP Licensing and Analytical Services:    •  Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses. While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses. Kodak also provides a wide range of analytical services to external clients at competitive rates.  Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities related to Advanced Materials and Chemicals growth initiatives. Net sales for Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 15%, 14% and 13% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. BrandThe Brand segment includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties. Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including digital, instant print and 35mm film cameras, printing and scanning consumer use devices, batteries, apparel and eyewear. Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their products and use their own distribution channels.         6     Table of Contents RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available. Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based on prevailing market prices for aluminum. Lithographic aluminum is experiencing significantly increased prices and demand. Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices. The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers. While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components, other components and specialty chemicals included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks. Refer to the Executive Overview section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events for additional information. SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSPrinting equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products. Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; and embedded information. Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance. In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well, such as color negative films, processing and print films and manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry. Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent. Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates. There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Kodak is subject to a wide variety of increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control. A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to Kodak’s operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on operations, cash flows or financial condition, Kodak does not currently anticipate material expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Kodak is focused on developing and delivering products and technologies that can drive sustainability performance by increasing operational efficiency, minimizing resource use, reducing costs over time and empowering customers to meet their own sustainability objectives. The opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of its products and services is especially great for print products, as commercial printing has historically been a significant source of waste and pollution. Kodak is developing in-house life cycle assessment and carbon foot printing capabilities, which will help identify where the environmental footprint of Kodak’s products can be further reduced.        7     Table of Contents HUMAN CAPITALAs of January 1, 2023, Kodak employed approximately 4,200 employees across 35 countries. Kodak’s success greatly depends on identifying, attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas within Kodak. Outside the U.S. there are employees in certain countries that are represented by unions or similar organizations, such as works councils, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements . Kodak utilizes temporary staffing programs to develop a pipeline of talent and provide additional support during peak periods. This includes working closely with local schools to provide apprentice and intern programs. Approximately 2% of its workforce is temporary. Diversity, Equality and InclusionKodak is focused on creating an inclusive and creative environment globally. Kodak strives to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in its talent practices, and invest in and engage with its communities. Kodak conducts diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. Kodak has achieved a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for over two decades and is included on its list of “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality”. Health, Wellness and SafetyKodak is dedicated to driving continuous safety improvement across its operations. Kodak’s approach includes identifying and mitigating risk, targeted training, information sharing on safe work practices, and thorough analysis of incidents and near misses. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, Kodak has taken actions consistent with government mandates and continues to track active cases. The Executive Leadership Team reviews the impact of and responds to COVID-10 on a regular basis. Kodak will continue to emphasize the health and safety of its employees going forward. AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

 Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.     ●  If Kodak fails to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.     ●  Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.     ●  Failure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted.     ●  If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.     ●  If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.     ●  Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.     ●  Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition.          9     Table of Contents   ●  Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.     ●  Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.     ●  Kodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations.     ●  An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.   Summary of Risks Related to Kodak’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets   ●  The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.     ●  The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash.     ●  Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.     ●  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.     ●  The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.   Summary of Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks   ●  Legal proceedings and governmental investigations associated with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announcement or in general could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.    ●  Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.     ●  Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.     ●  Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     ●  If Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.    ●  Kodak may have additional tax liabilities.          10     Table of Contents   ●  Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.     ●  Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.   Summary of Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock    ●  The conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.     ●  The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock owns a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes each have the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.    ●  The Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of our outstanding securities. The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.    ●  The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.    ●  The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.  Risks Related to Kodak’s Business and Operations Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global economic and geopolitical conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, inflation, rising interest rates, and slowdowns in customer demand.        11     Table of Contents Worsening global economic conditions, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and  rising interest rates, could have material adverse impacts on Kodak’s business, cash flows, employees, suppliers, customers, and others’ ability to conduct business, including increased operational costs, extended business shutdowns, reduced operations, restrictions or interruptions in shipping, manufacturing or installing products, reduced consumer demand and the reduced ability of our customers to make payments. Accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers’ ability to pay, and our liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. Due to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, we have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased cost of energy, shipping, raw materials and labor, limited availability of raw materials and component products, delays in shipping and transportation and a decline in customer demand. Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have significantly increased, and could continue to increase. Ongoing disruptions in our supply chain could affect our ability to continue to meet customer demand for our products and services.  Continued or worsening operational and global economic conditions could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The extent to which the global economic conditions affect our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and variants, the actions taken in response to the pandemic, the continued impact of the war in Ukraine, any escalation thereof, and the impact of the international response thereto. For additional discussion regarding known impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the global economic environment, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations“ in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate our business.  Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing Kodak’s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with financing and monetization transactions over the past several years. Kodak's businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow. It may take Kodak longer than planned to generate positive cash flow from operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations for an extended period in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations, our ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited. Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances:   •  Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;   •  Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;   •  Kodak will meet all conditions associated with borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement;   •  Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth or operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan;   •  Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or   •  Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs.  Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the senior secured first lien term loans (the “Term Loans”) borrowed under the Credit Agreement, dated February 26, 2021, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Lenders”), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as Administrative Agent (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), the 5.0% unsecured convertible notes held by the Term Loan Lenders (the “2021 Convertible Notes”), the 4.0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and the 5.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, collateral requirements, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements.        12     Table of Contents If Kodak cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce our ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs. If Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which we are focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, Kodak’s financial performance could be adversely affected.  Kodak has focused our investments in print, advanced materials, and chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals (including pharmaceutical products), coated materials used in electric vehicle/energy storage batteries and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, Kodak’s strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that Kodak’s ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing our investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, Kodak’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected. If Kodak is unable to successfully or timely implement cost structure reductions, Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.  Kodak continues to rationalize our workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with our business initiatives. There are no assurances that workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures will be successful or the cost savings or other beneficial results will be consistent with expectations. The extent of change across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to diminished results, compliance issues, and harm to our reputation. If workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures are not effectively managed, Kodak may also experience lost sales, harm to our business and customer relationships, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees or other retention issues, product delays and increased costs. Finally, the timing and implementation of workforce reductions may require compliance with laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact Kodak’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business. In order to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees across the Company. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, is critical to our future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. Given that our business is highly technical and specialized, it would be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key employees. Kodak may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect Kodak’s business and results of operations.        13     Table of Contents If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate or rapidly respond to technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.  Kodak generally sells our products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Kodak’s success depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To do so, Kodak must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. Kodak’s customers may decide to outsource their imaging and printing needs or may purchase imaging and printing services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If Kodak does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to our current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of our competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to our competitors, which could adversely affect our product roadmaps and associated revenue streams. Kodak has reduced the scope of our corporate-focused research and development activities. If our investment in research and product development is inadequate, our response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services. Kodak’s investment in new products and services may not achieve expected returns.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting our revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue. If Kodak does not manage product reliability, yield and quality, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.  In developing, commercializing, manufacturing and servicing our products and services, Kodak must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.        14     Table of Contents Aging manufacturing facilities and equipment could lead to failures of equipment and systems. Kodak’s manufacturing facilities are aged, and without significant updates to equipment and systems, will be more prone to failure. Capital improvements to manufacturing facilities are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology.  The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base. If Kodak’s equipment and systems experience a critical failure, we could experience an interruption of operations, manufacturing delays, increased costs associated with repairs or redesigns of systems and products, loss of sales and customers and damage to Kodak’s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.  To effectively manage our global business, Kodak depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.  Attacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Therefore, the system controls and security measures Kodak and other third parties use to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents may not be sufficient to anticipate and identify these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks, breaches or defects in our systems or those of third parties could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s business and reputation. The speed to closure of significant cyber security incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies, which is outside of our control. Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to our customers and operates services used by our customers and hosted by Kodak. A breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers’ operations or data privacy, which could expose Kodak to liability and reputational harm. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by cyber-attacks or data security incidents in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of customers’ business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, any of which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Kodak fails to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.  Kodak uses a variety of distribution methods to sell and deliver our products and services, including direct sales, third-party resellers, channel partners and distributors. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels across customer segments for our products and services is complex. Since each distribution method has distinct risks and financial implications, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.        15     Table of Contents Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.  From time to time, Kodak may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to successfully pursue strategic transactions, Kodak must identify suitable sellers, buyers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. Strategic transactions may involve the following risks and challenges that could negatively impact our results of operations:   •  the need to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;   •  the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our business;   •  potential loss of key employees;   •  difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond our control;   •  wrong, inaccurate, or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated;   •  potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas;   •  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;   •  competition for strategic transactions, which may increase transaction costs and the ability to identify opportunities;   •  management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and   •  the possibility we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.  There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which we undertake or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins and profitability. Failure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted.  Kodak is implementing improvements to IT systems to more effectively manage our global business and implement our strategic plans. If Kodak is unable to successfully manage the development, improvement and transition of IT systems, anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements may be delayed or diminished, and we may experience cost overruns, disruption in our operations, or other business or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition. If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.  A key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights.        16     Table of Contents Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, some of Kodak’s businesses and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all. Kodak also licenses third parties to use our trademarks. In an effort to preserve our trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of our trademarks and requires our licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be diluted and our reputation harmed by our licensees’ activities. Also, failure by Kodak and our licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of our trademark rights.  Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of our licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue. In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct our business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios. Third parties may claim Kodak and our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like Kodak. Even if we believe the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business:   •  claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources;   •  claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products;   •  even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and   •  if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, Kodak’s revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.         17     Table of Contents Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of our products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition. If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.  Kodak’s products and brand have worldwide recognition. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of our brand, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers, distributors, channel partners, consumers and investors. Any harm to the reputation of Kodak or our brand could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial condition. The value of Kodak’s brand is reflected, in part, in our Brand segment, which licenses the Kodak brand for use by third parties in a wide range of products. Consumers and the public may view the products and activities of brand licensees as the products and activities of Kodak. The measures Kodak undertakes to research and manage licensee relationships and assess the quality of their products may not be sufficient to protect against legal proceedings and reputational harm in the event that licensed products and services do not meet consumer expectations for quality and safety. Other factors that could dilute or damage the reputation of Kodak and our brand include the failure of products and services to meet customer expectations, litigation and government investigations, negative or inaccurate comments in the media, including social media, and failure to meet and manage customer and industry expectations regarding the impact of our business on matters of social responsibility and environmental sustainability. Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.  The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may:   •  foresee the course of market developments more accurately than Kodak does;   •  sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services;   •  have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost;   •  have better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost;   •  develop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers;   •  adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements; or   •  have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms.  As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels which would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue, gross margins and cash flow. Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition.  Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages or outages, internet, systems and telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, failure of critical infrastructure, medical epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political or economic instability, including war and protests, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could cause disruptions to Kodak’s operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers and have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition.        18     Table of Contents Certain of Kodak’s critical business functions, including our manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak’s employees to physically work at our or our customers’ locations due to disruptions in service could harm Kodak’s operations, perhaps significantly. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, both Kodak and our customers could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of customers’ business, and unfavorable impact to business reputation, as a result of which there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.  Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations. To the extent we rely on third parties, we face the risks that those third parties may not be able to:   •  Obtain supplies and materials necessary to deliver goods or services to Kodak;   •  Mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions;   •  Develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products;   •  Maintain an adequate control environment; and   •  Quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products.  Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service and supply as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of our products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce our contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, interruption of IT services, risks related to the duration and termination of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials, non-competitive pricing due to tariffs, and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. Hardware, applications and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party suppliers may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be available or established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition. Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity. There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.        19     Table of Contents Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.  As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all of our segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Kodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations.  Kodak’s business is subject to additional costs and risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:   •  support of multiple languages;   •  recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;   •  compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;   •  complexity of managing international operations;   •  exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;   •  commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.;   •  multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;   •  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;   •  limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash and the potential obligation to move cash to locations limiting or restricting repatriation;   •  limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;   •  complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and   •  political or economic instability.  As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact. An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.  The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.        20     Table of Contents Risks Related to Kodak’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.  The Company has obligations for borrowed money or in connection with letters of credit under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”), the cash collateralized Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the “LC Credit Agreement”), and the 2021 Convertible Notes (together, the “Credit Agreements”). The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in our securities. These include the following:  •  Kodak may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt Kodak may have incurred;   •  We could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, collateral requirements, refinancing or other purposes;   •  We will have to use a significant part of our cash flow or cash balances to make payments on our debt and Series B Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and   •  adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.  The Company cannot be sure cash generated from our businesses will be as high as we expect, or our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our businesses or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect Kodak’s ability to fund our operations. The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash.  Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Equipment (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) less specified reserves as described in Note 9, “Debt and Finance Leases” to the consolidated financial statements. With the exception of the years ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2022, Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have been declining over the last several years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter. Availability under the Company’s LC Credit Agreement is based on cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 103% of the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at any given time (the “LC Cash Collateral”). If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $58 million of letters of credit outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement and the $11.25 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, or if LC Cash Collateral is not maintained to support the 103% of the $43 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement. Additional LC Cash Collateral would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs. If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, that would increase operational complexities for the Company. An event of default would occur under these circumstances if the Company is unable to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.        21     Table of Contents Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.  Kodak may desire to raise additional capital, including to pursue additional growth opportunities, strategic transactions or additional reorganization initiatives or refinance or redeem outstanding debt or preferred stock. Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or the current volatility and tightening in the financial and credit markets, Kodak’s access to the capital markets may be limited.  Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:   •  Covenants in the Credit Agreements;   •  Obtaining a consent from the holders of Series B and C Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series B and C Preferred Stock;   •  Investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which we operate;   •  Our financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of our subsidiaries;   •  Our levels of debt and redemption obligations;   •  Our ability to generate positive cash flow;   •  Our ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales;   •  Our requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;   •  Our current non-investment grade credit rating;   •  Our long-term business prospects; and   •  General economic and capital market conditions.  Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to capitalize on growth or efficiency opportunities or refinancings we would otherwise like to pursue. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.  A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements, including the Minimum US Liquidity requirements in the ABL Credit Agreement and the LC Credit Agreement, could result in an event of default under these facilities. The maturity for our 2023 Amended ABL Credit Agreement is June 12, 2024. If we are unable to extend the maturity date or refinance this facility, we would need to have sufficient cash, securities or other collateral to post in place of the letters of credit supported by these facilities. If the 2023 Amended ABL Credit Agreement is not extended or refinanced by February 26, 2024, we may need to address a $9 million reduction in commitments that would take effect on that date. If any default or event of default occurs under the LC Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and 2021 Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If applicable, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement, ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the 2021 Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.        22     Table of Contents The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.  The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances our credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies. Our credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. In carrying out our commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business. Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced. In particular, given the Company’s current credit ratings we may be required to post additional collateral to secure workers' compensation-related obligations. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Legal proceedings and governmental investigations associated with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announcement or in general could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. On July 28, 2020, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (the “DFC”) announced (the “DFC Announcement”) the signing of a non-binding letter of interest to provide a subsidiary of the Company with a potential $765 million loan (the “DFC Loan”) to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, an initiative that would manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients for essential generic drugs (the “DFC Pharmaceutical Project”). The DFC Announcement and circumstances surrounding it prompted congressional investigations, an SEC investigation and a New York Attorney General’s investigation. In addition, lawsuits have been filed or threatened alleging various securities law violations and breaches of fiduciary duties based on circumstances surrounding the DFC Announcement. For further information on these investigations and lawsuits, see Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Financial Statements. Legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. The investigations and lawsuits associated with the DFC announcement have diverted, and may continue to divert, the attention of Kodak’s employees, management and board of directors. In addition, the response to the DFC related investigations and lawsuits has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased legal expense and related costs. Kodak’s insurance, to the extent maintained, is not expected to cover all costs associated with the investigations and legal proceedings. We are unable to predict how much longer the legal proceedings and investigations to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any governmental investigation or legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or stock price. Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.  Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.        23     Table of Contents Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Kodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and Kodak periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of our policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak’s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operation or financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.  Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. More recent examples of data privacy laws include (but are not limited to) the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and ePrivacy laws, California’s Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”). Recently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws and regulations in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Recent developments in the regulation of cross-border data transfers from the European Economic Area and countries with similar regimes, including enforcement decisions and regulatory guidance issued by key supervisory authorities, creates uncertainty as to our and our customers’ ability to use platforms and processing services located in the U.S. and other non-adequate jurisdictions. While existing data transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain valid, Kodak’s use of these transfer mechanisms is subject to legal, regulatory and political pressure. Kodak anticipates spending additional time and expense to enable continued cross-border transfers as needed to operate our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. This environment demands Kodak continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across our businesses and geographies. While Kodak has taken steps to comply with the GDPR, other applicable data protection laws, and the regulations and guidance published by applicable regulators, our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance may not be fully successful. Despite Kodak’s security controls over personal data, Kodak, may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of our products. Changes to such laws and regulations could limit the sale of certain of our products in certain jurisdictions or require modifications to our products that may be costly, time consuming or infeasible.        24     Table of Contents Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak’s properties may impact our ability to further develop or sell such properties. If Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities. Kodak is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”. The existence of a material weakness in Kodak’s internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s business, financial condition, cash flow results of operations or the trading price of Kodak’s stock. Kodak may have additional tax liabilities.  Kodak is subject to income and other taxes in the United States and many other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in these jurisdictions. We believe that the positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and we believe we have provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit. We adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. Determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates, and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable. We may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.  Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In past years, Kodak has experienced variability in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including variability in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and benefits. There can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting cost increases.        25     Table of Contents Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows or market capitalization decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock  The conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.  The 1,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 9.5238 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, the 1,096,797 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 10 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, and the 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 100 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Convertible Notes. The outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Convertible Notes are expected to increase as a result of the payment of dividends and interest in kind at a rate of 5.0% per annum. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or 2021 Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Securities”), the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2022, the conversion of all Convertible Securities would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 23% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock. If Convertible Securities are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Securities will be a dilution to dividends and distributions. Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Securities or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock owns a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes each have the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board. The holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock holds approximately 12% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, this holder may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock also has the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). This nomination right expires upon the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holder ceasing to directly or indirectly hold at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or the common stock received upon the conversion of such shares and is exclusive to the initial holder and does not transfer with the Series C Preferred Stock.        26     Table of Contents Also, an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Board until the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Term Loans or until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, whichever is earlier. Until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, at any time that the director nominated by the affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders is not serving on the Board, such affiliate will have the right to designate a non-voting observer to the Board. Also, if dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside. As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holder of Series C Preferred Stock or an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders or nominated in the future by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would enable such holders and lenders to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board. The Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of our outstanding securities. The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In compliance with certain agreements to which the Company is a party, we have registered the resale of an aggregate of up to 44,490,032 shares of common stock that are either outstanding or issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock or convertible notes. The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the certain agreements to which the Company is subject, certain of the counterparties to such agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of our common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected. The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes. Holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock collectively have a significant influence over matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of such securities collectively would be able to cause a significant change in the ownership of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions in securities of the Company which have already occurred or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially. Certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s outstanding securities not involving these holders, could also cause such an “ownership change”. For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 18, “Income Taxes”. The interests of the holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of the Company’s common stock experienced extreme volatility in the context of the DFC Announcement and has declined significantly since that time. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations, sales of large blocks of our common stock and developments concerning the investigations, lawsuits and claims relating to the DFC Announcement, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.         27     Table of Contents        "

Kodak provides industry-leading hardware, software, consumables and services primarily to customers in commercial print, packaging, publishing, manufacturing and entertainment. With 31,000 patents earned over 130 years of R&D, we believe in the power of technology and science to enhance what the world sees and creates. Our innovative, award-winning products, combined with our customer-first approach, allow us to attract customers worldwide. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship, including industry leadership in developing sustainable solutions for print.The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSKodak’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Traditional Printing, Digital Printing, Advanced Materials and Chemicals and Brand.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park operations.  Traditional Printing The Traditional Printing segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions.  The Traditional Printing segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.   This segment is experiencing challenges from higher raw material and other supply chain costs, digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures. Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of increases in manufacturing costs, including aluminum prices, through a combination of surcharges and price increases, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives.  In addition Kodak seeks to offset the impact of long-term market dynamics on pricing and volume pressures through innovations in Kodak product lines. The goal of Prepress Solutions is to pursue a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.  The Traditional Printing products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers and channel partners. Kodak’s primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which may strengthen demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.   Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates.  Instead of the traditional process in which a plate is run through processing equipment containing a solution of developer, chemicals and water to set the image, KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates enable printers to set the image on the platesetter, then go directly to press.  There’s also no processing variability, so process-free plate users benefit from more consistent and stable plates.It’s designed to be a much more environmentally friendly approach that could eliminate all processing chemicals, water and excess energy and waste from the plate-making process.  These plates are designed to deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.3  Net sales for Traditional Printing accounted for 57%, 58% and 59% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Traditional Printing segment also provides service and support related to these products.On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China.  The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement for HuaGuang to help Kodak fulfill customer demand and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology, including its Sonora Process Free plates technology, to HuaGuang with the intent of expanding the plates market in China.  Upon the establishment of the relationship, Kodak received net cash proceeds of $30 million, of which $13 million was received in the United States.  As part of the arrangement, Kodak established an escrow in China to secure minimum payments required under the supply agreement.  The escrow balance as of December 31, 2021 approximated $4 million.  Digital Printing The Digital Printing segment contains Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, Prosper, Versamark and Software.  Digital Printing products include high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology, production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components, software and services.  Digital Printing products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. The markets that the Digital Printing segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels.  Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh and Screen.  Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below.•Electrophotographic Printing Solutions:  •NEXFINITY printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products.  •The ASCEND printer is a new electrophotographic press aimed at the retail, point of purchase and packaging markets.  ASCEND printers enable customers to print and embellish on heavyweight stocks and are designed for customers looking to create sort-run packaging, displays and signage.  The ASCEND printers are anticipated to be available mid-2022.  •Prosper:  •The Prosper business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging on a variety of substrates.  PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage.  The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service.  •The focus of the Prosper business is on developing innovative solutions for customers which includes Kodak’s next generation inkjet platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in OEM products and systems as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.    •Versamark:  •The KODAK VERSAMARK Products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER business.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press Systems.  Users of KODAK VERSAMARK products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak.  Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.4 •Software:  •The Software business offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak products and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output.  Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with over 15,000 systems installed in some of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world.  Kodak plans to expand the PRINERGY offering with its cloud-based PRINERGY On Demand Platform in early 2022.  •The Software business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency. Net sales for Digital Printing accounted for 22%, 23% and 24% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Advanced Materials and Chemicals The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment is comprised of three lines of business: Industrial Film and Chemicals, Motion Picture and Advanced Materials and Functional Printing.  Kodak Services for Business (“KSB”), which provided business process outsourcing services, was sold to Swiss Post Solutions in December 2020 and Kodakit, which was a platform that connected businesses with professional photographers, was discontinued in October 2019.   Kodak’s Advanced Materials and Chemicals products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  Kodak Alaris, a professional and consumer still photographic film and chemicals customer, represented approximately 32%, 30% and 20% of total Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below. The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment includes the Kodak Research Laboratories which conduct research, develop new product or new business opportunities and file patent applications for its inventions and innovations.   The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment also manages licensing of its intellectual property to third parties and is a supporting participant for any licensing of Kodak intellectual property to a third party.  Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.    •Industrial Film and Chemicals:  •Offers professional and consumer still photographic film, as well as industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards.  •Includes related component businesses: Specialty Chemicals; Solvent Recovery; and Polyester Film.  Specialty Chemicals include unregulated key starting materials (“KSMs”) for pharmaceuticals.  Kodak intends to continue organic expansion of its KSM production and is exploring opportunities to further expand its pharmaceutical offerings.   •Offers specialty inks and dispersions to third parties.  •Offers coating and product commercialization services: offerings include both pilot-scale and production scale roll-to-roll coating capabilities utilizing Kodak’s assets and know-how to commercialize and manufacture third party products.  •Includes Consumer Inkjet Solutions.  Starting in 2013, Kodak stopped manufacturing consumer inkjet printers and focused on the sale of ink to its installed printer base.  Kodak’s final build of ink inventory was depleted in the second quarter of 2020.5 •Motion Picture:  •Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers.  •Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offer onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe. •Advanced Materials and Functional Printing:  •Advanced Materials develops solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories.  There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category.  Currently, the primary focus is on light blocking particles (Kodalux) for the textile market. In addition, a specialty material is manufactured by this group for use by a 3D printing customer.  •Functional Printing concentrates on contract manufacturing, development partnerships, and/or licensing opportunities in very high-resolution 3D printing solutions such as printed electronics.  Development partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak’s efforts to further develop such technologies into products.  Also, a portfolio of products is offered to enable others to utilize functional printing.  •IP Licensing and Analytical Services:  •Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses.  While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment still carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses. Kodak also provides a wide range of analytical services to external clients at competitive rates.Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities related to Advanced Materials and Chemicals growth initiatives.Net sales for Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 14%, 13% and 11% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. BrandThe Brand segment includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties.  Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including digital, instant print and 35mm film cameras, printing and scanning consumer use devices, batteries, apparel and eyewear.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their products and use their own distribution channels. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak included the Flexographic Packaging business.  Refer to Note 28, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based on prevailing market prices for aluminum.  Lithographic aluminum is experiencing significantly increased prices and demand.  Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers.  While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components, other components and specialty chemicals included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.  Refer to the Executive Overview section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events for additional information. 6  SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSPrinting equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance. In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well, such as manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry. Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Kodak is subject to a wide variety of increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.  It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.  A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to Kodak’s operations, cash flows or financial position.  Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on operations, cash flows or financial condition, Kodak does not currently anticipate material expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Kodak is focused on developing and delivering products and technologies that can drive sustainability performance by increasing operational efficiency, minimizing resource use, reducing costs over time and empowering customers to meet their own sustainability objectives. The opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of its products and services is especially great for print products, as commercial printing has historically been a significant source of waste and pollution.  Kodak is partnering with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Pollution Prevention Institute to develop in-house life cycle assessment and carbon foot printing capabilities, which will help identify where the environmental footprint of Kodak’s products can be further reduced.   HUMAN CAPITALAs of January 1, 2022, Kodak employed approximately 4,200 employees across 35 countries.  Kodak’s success greatly depends on identifying, attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas within Kodak.   Kodak utilizes temporary staffing programs to develop a pipeline of talent and provide additional support during peak periods.  This includes working closely with local schools to provide apprentice and intern programs.  Approximately 2% of its workforce is temporary.   7 Diversity, Equity and InclusionKodak is focused on creating an inclusive and creative environment globally.  Kodak strives to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in its talent practices, and invest in and engage with its communities.  Kodak conducts diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.Kodak has achieved a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for over two decades and is included on its list of “Best Places to Work for LGBTO+ Equality”. Health, Wellness and SafetyKodak is dedicated to driving continuous safety improvement across its operations. Kodak’s approach includes identifying and mitigating risk, targeted training, information sharing on safe work practices, and thorough analysis of incidents and near misses. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy.  In response to the pandemic, Kodak has taken actions consistent with government mandates and continues to track active cases.  The Executive Leadership Team reviews the actions and status of cases on a regular basis.  Kodak will continue to emphasize the health and safety of its employees going forward.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to Company, About Us, Investor Center, Financials and then SEC Filings.ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks and uncertainties. The risk factors described below, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in our securities risky.  You should consider carefully these risks and uncertainties in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes.Risks Related to Kodak’s Business and OperationsKodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has had, or another global health crisis could have material adverse impacts on Kodak’s employees, suppliers, customers, and others’ ability to conduct business. The negative effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have, and may continue to have, material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets in which we operate.The pandemic and actions undertaken in response to the pandemic by Kodak, governmental bodies or other groups may have a material adverse effect on our business or our suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions or interruptions in shipping, manufacturing or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments. We have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased cost of raw materials and labor, the availability of raw materials and component products, delays in shipping and transportation and slow recovery of customer demand. Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have significantly increased, and will likely continue to increase. Ongoing disruptions in our supply chain could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and services.  Adverse operational and economic circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response to the pandemic. For additional discussion regarding known impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations“ in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.8 The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate our business. Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing Kodak’s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with financing and monetization transactions over the past several years.  Kodak’s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses.It may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.  If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations for an extended period in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations, our ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances:  •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs. Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the senior secured first lien term loans (the “Term Loans”) borrowed under the Credit Agreement, dated February 26, 2021, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Lenders”), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as Administrative Agent (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), the 5.0% unsecured convertible notes held by the Term Loan Lenders (the “2021 Convertible Notes”), the 4.0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and the 5.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements. If Kodak cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce our ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs. If Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which we are focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, Kodak’s financial performance could be adversely affected. Kodak has focused our investments in print, advanced materials, and chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet and electrophotography, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals (including pharmaceutical products), coated materials used in electric vehicle/energy storage batteries and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, Kodak’s strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that Kodak’s ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing our investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, Kodak’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.9 If Kodak is unable to successfully or timely implement cost structure reductions, Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. Kodak continues to rationalize our workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with our business initiatives. There are no assurances that workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures will be successful or the cost savings or other beneficial results will be consistent with expectations. The extent of change across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to diminished results, compliance issues, and harm to our reputation. If workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures are not effectively managed, Kodak may also experience lost sales, harm to our business and customer relationships, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees or other retention issues, product delays and increased costs.Finally, the timing and implementation of workforce reductions may require compliance with laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact Kodak’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.In order to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees across the Company. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, is critical to our future.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations.  Given that our business is highly technical and specialized, it would be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key employees. Kodak may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect Kodak’s business and results of operations.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate or rapidly respond to technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. Kodak generally sells our products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Kodak’s success depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To do so, Kodak must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve.  Kodak’s customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If Kodak does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to our current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of our competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to our competitors, which could adversely affect our product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.Kodak has reduced the scope of our corporate-focused research and development activities.  If our investment in research and product development is inadequate, our response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.10 Kodak’s investment in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting our revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.  New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue.If Kodak does not manage product reliability, yield and quality, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed. In developing, commercializing and manufacturing our products and services, Kodak must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products.Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines.Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.Aging manufacturing facilities and equipment could lead to failures of equipment and systems.Kodak’s manufacturing facilities are aged, and without significant updates to equipment and systems, will be more prone to failure.  Capital improvements to manufacturing facilities are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology.  The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base. If Kodak’s equipment and systems experience a critical failure, we could experience an interruption of operations, manufacturing delays, increased costs associated with repairs or redesigns of systems and products, loss of sales and customers and damage to Kodak’s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If Kodak fails to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted. Kodak uses a variety of distribution methods to sell and deliver our products and services, including direct sales, third-party resellers, channel partners and distributors. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels across customer segments for our products and services is complex. Since each distribution method has distinct risks and financial implications, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.   Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition. To effectively manage our global business, Kodak depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.11 Attacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Therefore, the system controls and security measures Kodak and other third parties use to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents may not be sufficient to anticipate and identify these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks, breaches or defects in our systems could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s business and reputation.Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to our customers, and operates services used by our customers and hosted by Kodak. A breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers’ operations or data privacy, which could expose Kodak to liability and reputational harm.Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results. From time to time, Kodak may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives.In order to successfully pursue strategic transactions, Kodak must identify suitable sellers, buyers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses.  Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. Strategic transactions may involve the following risks and challenges that could negatively impact our results of operations: •the need to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our business; •potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control; •wrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; •competition for strategic transactions, which may increase transaction costs and the ability to identify opportunities; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which we undertake or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction.  If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins and profitability. Failure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Kodak is focused on improvements to IT systems to more effectively manage our global business and implement our strategic plans. If Kodak is unable to successfully manage the development, improvement and transition of IT systems, anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements may be delayed or diminished, and we may experience cost overruns, disruption in our operations, or other business or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations, business and financial condition.12 If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted. A key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States.Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position.  Also, some of Kodak’s business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use our trademarks. In an effort to preserve our trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of our trademarks and requires our licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be diluted and our reputation harmed by our licensees’ activities.  Also, failure by Kodak and our licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of our trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of our licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct our business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if we believe the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business: •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products; •even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, Kodak’s revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.13 Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of our products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.Impacts of the war in Ukraine are likely to have an adverse impact on the global economy, our business, financial condition and results of operations.   The war in Ukraine, actions taken by Russia, Ukraine and the international community responses, have caused, and will likely continue to cause, decreased availability of components and raw materials, increases in shipping, energy and raw material costs and increased transit times. While we do not believe that we or our suppliers obtain components or materials directly from Russian sources, Russia is a significant source of aluminum and electronic components to various suppliers that may impact our ability to secure these materials from our direct suppliers.  Energy costs are a significant component of the cost of producing aluminum, and our aluminum suppliers are based in Europe and may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs resulting from the war in Ukraine.  Any escalation of the war in Ukraine, continued transit delays, decreased availability of components and raw materials, increases in shipping, energy and raw material costs associated with the war in Ukraine and compliance with associated economic sanctions could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity. The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events.  Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on our results of operations and liquidity.In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events, and our liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect our ability to meet our anticipated cash needs, impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Following an implementation period after the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and as of 1 January 2021 the UK is no longer a member of the EU single market and customs union. The uncertainty concerning Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries. This uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with the Company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside Kodak’s control but may cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. Kodak’s products and brand have worldwide recognition. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of our brand, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers, distributors, channel partners, consumers and investors. Any harm to the reputation of Kodak or our brand could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial condition. The value of Kodak’s brand is reflected, in part, in our Brand segment, which licenses the Kodak brand for use by third parties in wide range of products. Consumers and the public may view the products and activities of brand licensees as the products and activities of Kodak. The measures Kodak undertakes to research and manage licensee relationships and assess the quality of their products may not be sufficient to protect against legal proceedings and reputational harm in the event that licensed products and services do not meet consumer expectations for quality and safety. Other factors that could dilute or damage the reputation of Kodak and our brand include the failure of products and services to meet customer expectations, litigation and government investigations, negative or inaccurate comments in the media, including social media, and failure to meet and manage customer and industry expectations regarding the impact of our business on matters of social responsibility and environmental sustainability. 14 Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share. The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may:  •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than Kodak does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than we can obtain.As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels which would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue, gross margins and cash flow.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition. Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages or outages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, failure of critical infrastructure, medical epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political or economic instability, including war and protests, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could cause disruptions to Kodak’s operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers and have material adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition. Certain of Kodak’s critical business functions, including our manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak’s employees to physically work at our or our customers’ locations due to disruptions in service could harm Kodak’s operations, perhaps significantly.  The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent we rely on third-parties, we face the risks that those third parties may not be able to:  •••Obtain supplies and materials necessary to deliver goods or services to Kodak Mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions;Develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products; •Maintain an adequate control environment; and •Quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products.15 Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service and supply as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of our products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce our contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers.Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, interruption of IT services, risks related to the duration and termination of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials, non-competitive pricing due to tariffs, and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be available or established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition.Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity.  There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all of our segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan.  Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on Kodak’s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Kodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations. Kodak’s business is subject to additional costs and risks associated with doing business internationally, such as: •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;16  •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position. The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services.  We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources.  Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted. Risks Related to Kodak’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThe Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.  The Company has obligations for borrowed money or in connection with letters of credit under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”), the cash collateralized Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the “LC Credit Agreement”), and the 2021 Convertible Notes (together, the “Credit Agreements”).  The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in our securities. These include the following: •Kodak may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt Kodak may have incurred; •We could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes;  •We will have to use a significant part of our cash flow or cash balances to make payments on our debt and Series B Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.The Company cannot be sure cash generated from our businesses will be as high as we expect, or our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our businesses or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect Kodak’s ability to fund our operations. The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash.  Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment less specified reserves as described in Note 8, “Debt and Finance Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  With the exception of 2020 to 2021 with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have been declining over the last several years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.   Availability under the Company’s LC Credit Agreement is based on cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 103% of the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at any given time (the “LC Cash Collateral”).  17  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $46 million of letters of credit outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement and the $11.25 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement,  or if LC Cash Collateral is not maintained to support the 103% of the $44 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.   Additional LC Cash Collateral would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs. If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, that would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur under these circumstances if the Company is unable to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement. Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.  Kodak may desire to raise additional capital, including to pursue additional growth opportunities, strategic transactions or additional reorganization initiatives or refinance or redeem outstanding debt or preferred stock.  Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, Kodak’s access to the capital markets may be limited. Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: •Covenants in the Credit Agreements; •Obtaining a consent from the holders of Series B and C Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series B and C Preferred Stock; •Investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which we operate; •Our financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of our subsidiaries; •Our levels of debt and redemption obligations; •Our ability to generate positive cash flow; •Our ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales; •Our requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •Our current non-investment grade credit rating; •Our long-term business prospects; and •General economic and capital market conditions.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to capitalize on growth or efficiency opportunities or refinancings we would otherwise like to pursue. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.  A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements could result in an event of default under these facilities.  18 If any default or event of default occurs under the LC Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, the agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and 2021 Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  If applicable, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement, ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the 2021 Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.  The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances our credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future.  In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies.   Our credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. In carrying out our commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business.  Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  In particular, given the Company’s current credit ratings we would be required, if requested, to provide up to $3 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance RisksLegal proceedings and governmental investigations associated with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announcement or in general could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.On July 28, 2020, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (the “DFC”) announced (the “DFC Announcement”) the signing of a non-binding letter of interest to provide a subsidiary of the Company with a potential $765 million loan (the “DFC Loan”) to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, an initiative that would manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients for essential generic drugs (the “DFC Pharmaceutical Project”).  The DFC Announcement and circumstances surrounding it prompted congressional investigations, an SEC investigation and a New York Attorney General’s investigation.  In addition, lawsuits have been filed or threatened alleging various securities law violations and breaches of fiduciary duties based on circumstances surrounding the DFC Announcement. For further information on these investigations and lawsuits, see Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Financial Statements. 19 Legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. The investigations and lawsuits associated with the DFC announcement have diverted, and may continue to divert, the attention of Kodak’s employees, management and board of directors. In addition, the response to the DFC related investigations and lawsuits has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased legal expense and related costs. Kodak’s insurance, to the extent maintained, is not expected to cover all costs associated with the investigations and legal proceedings. We are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings and investigations to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any governmental investigation or legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or stock price. Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences. Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Kodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and Kodak periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of our policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak’s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s results of operation or financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition. Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. More recent examples of data privacy laws include the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), California’s Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”).Recently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.  Recent developments in the regulation of cross-border data transfers from the European Economic Area and countries with similar regimes, including enforcement decisions and regulatory guidance issued by key supervisory authorities, creates uncertainty as to our and our customers’ ability to use platforms and processing services located in the U.S. and other non-adequate jurisdictions. While existing data transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain valid, Kodak’s use of these transfer mechanisms is subject to legal, regulatory and political pressure. Kodak anticipates spending additional time and expense to enable continued cross-border transfers as needed to operate our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.20  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across our businesses and geographies. While Kodak has taken steps to comply with the GDPR, other applicable data protection laws, and the regulations and guidance published by applicable regulators, our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance may not be fully successful.  Despite Kodak’s security controls over personal data, Kodak, may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of our products.Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak’s properties may impact our ability to further develop or sell such properties. If Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities. Kodak is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”.  The existence of a material weakness in Kodak’s internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s business, financial condition, cash flow results of operations or the trading price of Kodak’s stock.Kodak may have additional tax liabilities. Kodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak’s worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.Management’s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow. Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.21 In past years, Kodak has experienced variability in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including variability in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and benefits. There can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting cost increases. Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock The conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock. The 1,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 9.5238 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, the 1,043,629 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 10 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, and the 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 100 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Convertible Notes.  The outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Convertible Notes are expected to increase as a result of the payment of dividends and interest in kind at a rate of 5.0% per annum.  As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or 2021 Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Securities”), the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2021, the conversion of all Convertible Securities would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 22% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion.  Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Convertible Securities are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Securities will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Securities or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock owns a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes each have the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.The holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock holds approximately 11% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, this holder may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.22 The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock also has the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).  This nomination right expires upon the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holder ceasing to directly or indirectly hold at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or the common stock received upon the conversion of such shares and is exclusive to the initial holder and does not transfer with the Series C Preferred Stock.Also, an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Board until the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Term Loans or until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, whichever is earlier.  Until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, at any time that the director nominated by the affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders is not serving on the Board, such affiliate will have the right to designate a non-voting observer to the Board.Also, if dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside. As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holder of Series C Preferred Stock or an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders or nominated in the future by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would enable such holders and lenders to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board.The Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of our outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.In compliance with certain agreements to which the Company is a party, we have registered the resale of an aggregate of up to 44,490,032 shares of common stock that are either outstanding or issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock or convertible notes.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the certain agreements to which the Company is subject, certain of the counterparties to such agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of our common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.Holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock collectively have a significant influence over matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of such securities collectively would be able to cause a significant change in the ownership of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them.  If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions in securities of the Company which have already occurred or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  Certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s outstanding securities not involving these holders, could also cause such an “ownership change”.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 17, “Income Taxes”.  The interests of the holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.  The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated substantially, experienced extreme volatility in the context of the DFC Announcement and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations, sales of large blocks of our common stock and developments concerning the investigations, lawsuits and claims relating to the DFC Announcement, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.23 "

Kodak provides industry-leading hardware, software, consumables and services primarily to customers in commercial print, packaging, publishing, manufacturing and entertainment. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship and ongoing leadership in developing sustainable solutions. Kodak’s broad portfolio of superior products, responsive support and world-class R&D make Kodak solutions a smart investment for customers looking to improve their profitability and drive growth. The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSKodak has four reportable segments:  Traditional Printing, Digital Printing, Advanced Materials and Chemicals and Brand.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park operations.  Traditional Printing  The Traditional Printing segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions.  The Traditional Printing segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.   While this segment is experiencing challenges from digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion.  Additionally, Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of market dynamics on pricing and volume pressures and of increases in manufacturing costs, including aluminum prices, through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives.    Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.  The Traditional Printing products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.   Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, the plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices. Net sales for Traditional Printing accounted for 58% and 59% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Traditional Printing segment also provides service and support related to these products.On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China.  The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement from HuaGuang to Kodak; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology to HuaGuang to sell into the plates market in China.  3For further information on the relationship with HuaGuang, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”) and Note 16, “Other Operating (Income) Expense, net” in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Digital Printing The Digital Printing segment contains Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, Prosper, Versamark and Software.  Digital Printing products include high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology, production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components, software and services.  Digital Printing products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. The markets that the Digital Printing segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels.  Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh, and Screen.•Electrophotographic Printing Solutions:  •NEXFINITY printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products.  •DIGIMASTER printers use monochrome electrophotographic printing technology for transactional printing, short-run books, corporate documentation, manuals and direct mail.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing Digimaster printers but continues to sell consumables into the installed base.   •Prosper:  •The Prosper business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging.  PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage.  The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service.  •The focus of the Prosper business is on developing the next generation platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in OEMs products and systems as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.  The Prosper business closed on the first sale of a writing system for use in a packaging application in December of 2019 with Uteco Group.  Uteco Group is integrating Ultrastream in a packaging press solution.  •The Prosper business includes Kodak Print Services.  Kodak Print Services prints the Jersey Evening Post as well as the majority of U.K. national newspapers for distribution in both Jersey and Guernsey islands.  The business is used to demonstrate the value of the Kodak Prosper presses to customers around the world. •Versamark:  •The KODAK VERSAMARK Products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER business.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press Systems.  Users of KODAK VERSAMARK products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak.  Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail. •Software:  •The Software business offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak products and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output.  Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with over 15,000 systems installed in some of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world. 4 •The Software business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency. Net sales for Digital Printing accounted for 23% and 24% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Advanced Materials and Chemicals  The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment is comprised of four lines of business: Industrial Film and Chemicals, Motion Picture, Advanced Materials and Functional Printing and Kodak Services for Business (“KSB”).  Kodak’s Advanced Materials and Chemicals products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  Kodak Alaris, a professional and consumer still photographic film and chemicals customer, represented approximately 30% and 20% of total Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment includes the Kodak Research Laboratories which conduct research, develop new product or new business opportunities and file patent applications for its inventions and innovations.  The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment also manages licensing of its intellectual property to third parties and is a supporting participant for any licensing of Kodak intellectual property to a third party.  Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.    •Industrial Film and Chemicals:  •Offers industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards, as well as professional and consumer still photographic film.  •Includes related component businesses: Polyester Film; Solvent Recovery; and Specialty Chemicals.  Specialty Chemicals include unregulated key starting materials (“KSMs”) for pharmaceuticals.  Kodak intends to continue organic expansion of its KSM production and is exploring opportunities to further expand its pharmaceutical offerings.   •Offers specialty inks and dispersions to third parties.  •Offers Coating and Product Commercialization Services: Offerings include both pilot-scale and production scale roll-to-roll coating capabilities utilizing Kodak’s assets and know-how to commercialize and manufacture 3rd party products.  •Includes Consumer Inkjet Solutions.  Starting in 2013, Kodak stopped manufacturing consumer inkjet printers and focused on the sale of ink to its installed printer base.  Kodak’s final build of ink inventory was depleted in the second quarter of 2020.5•Motion Picture  •Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers.  •Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offer onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe. •Advanced Materials  •Advanced Materials develops solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories.  There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category.  Currently, the primary focus is on light blocking particles (Kodalux) for the textile market. In addition, a specialty material is manufactured by this group for use by a 3D printing customer. •Functional Printing:  •Functional Printing concentrates on contract manufacturing, development partnerships, and/or licensing opportunities in very high-resolution 3D printing solutions such as printed electronics.  Development partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak’s efforts to further develop such technologies into products.  Also, a portfolio of products is offered to enable others to utilize functional printing.  •IP Licensing and Analytical Services:  •Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses.  While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment still carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses. Kodak also provides a wide range of analytical services to external clients at market rates. •Kodak Services for Business:  •KSB provides business process outsourcing services, scan and capture solutions, records conversion services, workflow solutions, content management, and print and managed media services that assist customers with solutions that meet their business requirements.  During 2020, KSB operated exclusively in Asia, primarily in China and Hong Kong.  •KSB was sold to Swiss Post Solutions in December 2020. •Kodakit  •Kodakit was a platform that connected businesses with professional photographers to cater to their photography needs. Customers included global hotels and online travel agencies, real estate companies, marketplaces, advertising agencies and global brands.  •In October 2019, Kodak decided to discontinue the operation of Kodakit.Net sales for Motion Picture and Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 15% and 14% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brand The Brand segment includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties.  Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including digital, instant print and 35mm film cameras, printing and scanning consumer use devices, batteries, apparel and eyewear.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their products and use their own distribution channels. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak include the Flexographic Packaging business.  Refer to Note 29, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.6 RAW MATERIALS The raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to eighteen months prior.  Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers.  While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.  Also, tariffs imposed in the U.S. have the practical effect of reducing to a single source the potential suppliers of lithographic aluminum coils for U.S. production purposes. SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS Printing equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance. In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well; such as, manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry. Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”). It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control. Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2020, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 4,500 people globally, of whom approximately 1,900 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.7ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in its securities risky.  You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies Kodak’s assessment of the most significant factors which may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position, stock price or future financial performance.  Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.Risks Related to Kodak’s BusinessIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.Kodak’s business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. In addition, Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships.Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak’s business.The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business. The positive cash flow from operations generated by Kodak in 2019 were derived from working capital improvements and individual transactions which occurred during the year and are not expected to be recurring.  Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with monetization transactions over the past several years.  The Traditional Printing segment, Kodak’s largest segment, has had, and is expected to continue to have, declining revenues.  Kodak’s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses.  It may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.  If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations for an extended period in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations with proceeds from monetization transactions, its ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.8Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the senior secured first lien term loans (the “Term Loans”) borrowed under the Credit Agreement, dated February 26, 2021, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Lenders”), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as Administrative Agent (the “Credit Agreement”), the 5.0% unsecured convertible notes held by the Term Loan Lenders (the “Convertible Notes”), the 4.0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and the 5.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements. Its film manufacturing facilities are aged and without significant updates to equipment and systems will be more prone to failure.  Capital improvements are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology.  The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. There are no assurances:  •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.If Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs. If Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which it is focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, its financial performance could be adversely affected. Kodak has focused its investments in print, advanced materials, and chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet and electrophotography, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals (including pharmaceutical products) and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or that its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing its investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.Due to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position. As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. In the case of aluminum and other raw materials and components imported by Kodak, tariffs imposed from time to time may give rise to future cost increases.  Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity.The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, including as a result of the global outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19.  Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity.9In particular, if the coronavirus has a significant impact on the printing industry it could adversely impact the demand for Kodak’s products.  Certain known consequences to Kodak from the COVID-19 pandemic are disclosed in the financial statements contained in this Form 10-K and under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Kodak’s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of this filing, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope and duration of the pandemic and the restrictions and other actions implemented to fight it, among others.  Direct and indirect effects from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of Kodak’s business operations and its results of operations and financial position, particularly if such effects have an extended duration. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets.In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.Following an implementation period after the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and as of 1 January 2021 the UK is no longer a member of the EU single market and customs union. However, in December 2020 the UK reached a deal with the EU on certain key points, notably trade so that no duty is paid on goods moving between the UK and the EU.  Additional border checks have been introduced for goods leaving and entering the UK and these have resulted in some delays early in 2021. New export / import documentation required has resulted in some incremental costs.The uncertainty concerning Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries. This uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with the Company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside Kodak’s control but may cause it to adjust its strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.If Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products or do so in a timely manner, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer. Kodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards.Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to: •identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; •commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time; •differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings; •price its products and services competitively; •anticipate its competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; •work successfully alongside its partners; and •control product quality in its manufacturing processes.As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, UltraStream technology, new generations of Sonora offset plates, and small particle technology) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. In connection with new products, Kodak will face risks relating to talent acquisition, construction, obtaining regulatory approvals, cost overruns, delays, product development and market development, among others.  If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed.In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services it must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines.10Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results.Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak’s products are critical to its business.  Kodak’s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering.  One aspect of Kodak’s business is licensing others to use Kodak’s brand in connection with the sale of such licensees’ products and services, and activities by such licensees may be perceived by the market as being activities of Kodak.The success of Kodak’s brand can suffer if its or its licensees’ marketing plans, product initiatives or activities do not have the desired impact on the brand’s image or ability to attract customers.  Kodak’s results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak, its licensees or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the brand.  Kodak takes measures to research licensees prior to entering into agreements, assesses the quality of licensee products, and maintains strict requirements to govern licensees use of the brand.  Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its corporate values and commitments that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak’s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share. The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may:  •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than it does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position. The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price invoices for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.   11The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm its business.In order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate or rapidly respond to technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. Kodak serves imaging/print needs for business markets, including graphic communications, packaging, enterprise services, and printed electronics. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.Kodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities.  If its investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.Kodak makes investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.  New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue.Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to: •develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products; •maintain an adequate control environment; •quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products; •obtain supplies and materials necessary to deliver goods or services to Kodak; or •mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions.Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service and supply as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers.12Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, excess supply, interruption of IT services, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials, non-competitive pricing due to tariffs, and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be available or established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with its suppliers could adversely affect its liquidity.  There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with its financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and its supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of its key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on its sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19 has resulted in travel restrictions, disruptions to suppliers’ performance and delivery, as well as the temporary shutdown of many businesses.Certain of Kodak’s critical business functions, including its manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak’s employees to physically work at its or its customers locations due to government restrictions, health concerns or illness may disrupt its operations, perhaps significantly.  Kodak has experienced some disruptions in its manufacturing and logistics operations due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The full extent to which the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact Kodak’s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of this filing, including new information which may emerge concerning the coronavirus and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Complications from the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business operations and our results of operations and financial position.In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to Kodak’s operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. Kodak has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany.The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results. As part of Kodak’s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives.  In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable sellers, buyers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses.  Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which it undertakes or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the benefits sought to be achieved from such strategic transactions.  If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.13Kodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay. Kodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including: •the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business; •potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control; •wrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in its expenses and working capital requirements; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.Any of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about its workforce, its customers, or other third parties could disrupt its business, harm its reputation, cause it to lose customers, and expose it to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation. To effectively manage Kodak’s global business, it depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running its business.Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about its business, including intellectual property and confidential information of its customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks or defects in its systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to its business or its reputation.Kodak has system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect its IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of its operations or disclosure of confidential information, but it may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these threats to its internal information systems or those of its third-party providers.  A breach of Kodak’s security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of its information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its business.Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to its customers, and operates services used by its customers and hosted by Kodak, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of its security or reliability measures, or those of its third-party service providers, could negatively impact its customers’ operations or data privacy.Attacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. Kodak has programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, Kodak may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences. Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.14Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Kodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and it periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of its policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that its employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of its policies for which it may be ultimately responsible, or that its policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak’s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage its reputation and have a materially adverse effect on its results of operation or financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition. Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in its role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. More recent examples of data privacy laws include the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD).Recently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to its business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on its ability to obtain and process information and allegations by its customers and clients that it has not performed its contractual obligations. At the same time, the risk of cyber-attacks is relevant to the requirements regarding storage, transfer, sharing and handling of personal information.  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across its businesses and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted. A key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States.Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.  Also, some of Kodak’s business and some of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks and require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted and its reputation harmed by its licensees’ activities.  Also, failure by Kodak and its licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees.15There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business: •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products; •even if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow. Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect its results of operations. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also determined the fair value of its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company’s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values. 16Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations. Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak’s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  If Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.Kodak uses a variety of distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including direct sales, third-party resellers and distributors. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels across customer segments for its products and services is complex. Since each distribution method has distinct risks and financial implications, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue and earnings.Kodak’s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets. Because Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as: •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.There can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products.Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak’s properties may impact its ability to further develop or sell such properties.Kodak may have additional tax liabilities. Kodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak’s worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the course of its business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.17Management’s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.Kodak’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters. Kodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, remediations and proceedings concerning commercial, tax, tort, customs, employment, health and safety and intellectual property matters, licensee activities, and compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. On July 28, 2020, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (the “DFC”) announced (the “DFC Announcement”) the signing of a non-binding letter of interest to provide a subsidiary of the Company with a potential $765 million loan (the “DFC Loan”) to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, an initiative that would manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients for essential generic drugs (the “DFC Pharmaceutical Project”).  The DFC Announcement and circumstances surrounding it prompted congressional investigations, an SEC investigation and a New York Attorney General’s investigation.  A number of lawsuits have been filed or threatened alleging various securities law violations and breaches of fiduciary duties based on circumstances surrounding the DFC Announcement.  If the findings of the ongoing investigations are unfavorable or the Company is not successful in defending the lawsuits associated with the DFC Announcement, Kodak’s reputation could be damaged, its existing business could be adversely affected, and it may incur significant costs which may not be fully covered by insurance.Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries.As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain.  Kodak filed its most recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report for the reporting period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 on May 29, 2020.  As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country.  Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business.In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, it may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities. A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the cash collateralized Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the “LC Credit Agreement”), Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”), Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Convertible Notes, (together, the “Credit Agreements”) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any default or event of default occurs under the LC Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, the agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  If applicable, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement, ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.18On March 6, 2020 Kodak obtained a waiver from the agent and lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to any event of default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement that may be deemed to have occurred in relation to the going concern explanatory paragraph contained in the audit report on Kodak’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The additional liquidity provided by the financing transactions which closed on February 26, 2021, the extension of the maturity date of the ABL Credit Agreement, and the repurchase and exchange of the Series A Preferred Stock alleviated the substantial doubt about Kodak’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date its financial statements are issued (March 16, 2021) and therefore a waiver from the agent and lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement was not required for the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.  For more information on the reporting covenants under the Credit Agreements and the potential impact of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity.”The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral. The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future.  In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies.  Its credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.In carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  In particular, given the Company’s current credit ratings it would be required, if requested, to provide up to $3 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash. Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment less specified reserves as described in Note 9, “Debt and Finance Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past four years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.  Availability under the Company’s LC Credit Agreement is based on cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 103% of the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at any given time (the “LC Cash Collateral”).  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $42 million of letters of credit outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement and the $11 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement,  or if LC Cash Collateral is not maintained to support the 103% of the $49 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.  Additional LC Cash Collateral would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs.If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur under these circumstances if the Company is unable to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations. The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and its other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following: •it may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred; •it could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes; •it will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt and Series B Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.19The Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects, or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.Kodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to it and/or may be limited. Kodak may desire to raise additional capital, including to pursue additional growth opportunities, strategic transactions or additional reorganization initiatives or refinance or redeem outstanding debt or preferred stock.  Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets may be limited.Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: •covenants in the Credit Agreements; •obtaining a consent from the holders of Series B and C Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series B and C Preferred Stock; •investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates; •its financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of its subsidiaries; •its levels of debt and redemption obligations; •its ability to generate positive cash flow; •its ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales; •its requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •its current non-investment grade credit rating; •its long-term business prospects; and •general economic and capital market conditions.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit its ability to capitalize on growth or efficiency opportunities or refinancings it would otherwise like to pursue.Risks Related to the Company’s Common StockThe conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock. The 1,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 9.5238 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, the 750,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock (expected to increase to 1,000,000 outstanding shares) are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 10 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, and the Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 100 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes.  The outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes are expected to increase as a result of the payment of dividends and interest in kind at a rate of 5.0% per annum.  As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Securities”), the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of February 26, 2021 after giving effect to the issuance of the Convertible Securities, the conversion of all Convertible Securities would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 22% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion.  Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Convertible Securities are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Securities will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Securities or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock own a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes each have the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.The holder of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. 20Assuming the issuance of all shares of Series C Preferred Stock under contract to be issued, the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock would hold approximately 11% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, this holder may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock also has the right to nominate one member for election to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).  This nomination right expires upon the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holder ceasing to directly or indirectly hold at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or the common stock received upon the conversion of such shares, and is exclusive to the initial holder and does not transfer with the Series C Preferred Stock.Also, an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Board until the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Term Loans or until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, whichever is earlier.  Until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, at any time that the director nominated by the affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders is not serving on the Board, such affiliate will have the right to designate a non-voting observer to the Board.Also, if dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside. As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holder of Series C Preferred Stock or an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders or nominated in the future by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would enable such holders and lenders to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board.The Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock.In compliance with a Registration Rights Agreement to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of approximately 16.5 million shares of outstanding common stock.  The Company is also a party to Registration Rights Agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to register for resale the approximately 22 million shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Securities.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, certain of the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.Holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock collectively have a significant influence over matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of such securities collectively would be able to cause a significant change in the ownership of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them.  If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions in securities of the Company which have already occurred or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  Certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s outstanding securities not involving these holders, could also cause such an “ownership change”.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 18, “Income Taxes”.  The interests of the holders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company’s common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated substantially, experienced extreme volatility in the context of the DFC Announcement and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, its strategic initiatives (including the potential DFC Loan and any announcement concerning any initiatives concerning pharmaceuticals), its sales and profitability, quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations, sales of large blocks of its common stock and developments concerning the investigations, lawsuits and claims relating to the DFC Announcement, among other factors, could cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially"

Kodak provides industry-leading hardware, software, consumables and services primarily to customers in commercial print, packaging, publishing, manufacturing and entertainment. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship and ongoing leadership in developing sustainable solutions. Its broad portfolio of superior products, responsive support and world-class R&D make Kodak solutions a smart investment for customers looking to improve their profitability and drive growth. Kodak’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which assumes Kodak will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSKodak has six reportable segments:  Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Kodak Software, Brand, Film and Imaging, Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology and Eastman Business Park.  Print SystemsThe Print Systems segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, which offers high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology.  The Print Systems segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.  While the businesses in this segment are experiencing pricing pressure, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion.Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as Computer to Plate (“CTP”) equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates. Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of increases in aluminum prices through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives.  In January 2019, Kodak received exemptions on U.S. tariffs on aluminum. The Print Systems products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.  •Prepress Solutions: •Digital offset plates, which includes KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, the plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices. •CTP output devices that are used by customers to transfer images onto aluminum offset printing plates and provide consistent and high-quality imaging for offset press applications. CTP products provide high resolution, consistency and stability in thermal imaging. Kodak also offers a lower cost CTP system using TH5 imaging technology, which provides a highly efficient and cost-effective imaging solution at a lower price point. •Net sales for Prepress Solutions accounted for 59% and 58% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.3•Electrophotographic Printing Solutions: •NEXPRESS printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products. •DIGIMASTER printers use monochrome electrophotographic printing technology for transactional printing, short-run books, corporate documentation, manuals and direct mail. •Net sales for Electrophotographic Printing Solutions accounted for 9% and 10% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.The Print Systems segment also provides service and support related to these products.On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China.  The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement from HuaGuang to Kodak; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology to HuaGuang to sell into the plates market in China.  For further information on the relationship with HuaGuang, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”) and Note 30, “Assets Held for Sale” in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Enterprise Inkjet SystemsThe Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment contains the Prosper business and the Versamark business. The Enterprise Inkjet Systems products include production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components and services.  Enterprise Inkjet Systems products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that the Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels.  Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh, and Screen.   •Prosper: •The Prosper business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging.  PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage.  The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service. •The focus of the Prosper business is on developing the next generation platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in OEMs as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.  The Prosper business closed on the first sale of a writing system for use in a packaging application in December of 2019 with Uteco Group.  Uteco Group is integrating Ultrastream in a packaging press solution. •The Prosper business includes Kodak Print Services.  Kodak Print Services prints the Jersey Evening Post as well as the majority of U.K. national newspapers for distribution in both Jersey and Guernsey islands.  The business is used to demonstrate the value of the Kodak Prosper presses to customers around the world. •Versamark: •The KODAK VERSAMARK Products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER business.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press Systems.  Users of KODAK VERSAMARK products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak.  Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.Net sales for Enterprise Inkjet Systems accounted for 10% of Kodak’s total net revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.   Kodak Software The Kodak Software segment is comprised of the Software business.  The Software business offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak products and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output.4Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with over 15,000 systems installed in some of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world.  The Software business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency. Products and services are sold directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that Kodak Software serves are highly competitive.  Key customer segments each face competitive market pressure in pricing and new product introduction.  Primary competitors include Heidelberg, Agfa, Fuji, and Esko. Brand, Film and Imaging The Brand, Film and Imaging segment is comprised of five lines of business: Consumer Products, Industrial Film and Chemicals, Motion Picture, Kodak Services for Business (“KSB”) and Kodakit.  Kodak’s Brand, Film and Imaging products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their products and use their own distribution channels.  One Industrial Film and Chemicals customer of professional and consumer still photographic film and chemicals represented approximately 20% of total Brand, Film and Imaging segment revenues in 2019. •Consumer Products: •Includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties.  Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including batteries, digital and instant print cameras and camera accessories, printers, and LED lighting.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. •Consumer Inkjet Solutions, which involves the sale of ink to an existing installed base of consumer inkjet printers. •3rd party sales of specialty inks and dispersions. •Industrial Film and Chemicals: •Offers industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards, as well as professional and consumer still photographic film. •Includes related component businesses: Polyester Film; Solvent Recovery; and Specialty Chemicals. •Motion Picture: •Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers. •Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offering onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe. •Kodak Services for Business:   •KSB assists organizations with challenges and opportunities created by the worldwide digital transformation. It provides business process outsourcing services, scan and capture solutions, records conversion services, workflow solutions, content management, and print and managed media services that assist customers with solutions that meet their business requirements.   KSB has expertise in the capture, archiving, retrieval and delivery of documents including in depth knowledge of handling legacy media.  KSB serves enterprise customers primarily in the banking, insurance and government sectors.  Sales in KSB are project-based and can vary from year to year depending on the nature and number of projects in existence that year.  •Kodakit:   •Kodakit is a platform that connects businesses with professional photographers to cater to their photography needs. Customers include global hotels and online travel agencies, real estate companies, marketplaces, advertising agencies and global brands. 5 •In October 2019, Kodak decided to discontinue the operation of Kodakit.Net sales for Motion Picture and Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 14% and 12% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Advanced Materials and 3D Printing TechnologyThe Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment contains the Kodak Research Laboratories and associated new business opportunities and intellectual property licensing not directly related to other business divisions.  Kodak conducts research and files patent applications with fundamental inventions from the Kodak Research Laboratories.  Additionally, Kodak continues to file new patent applications in areas aligned with its core businesses.  Via these core business patent applications along with the research inventions, Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.  Product solutions in Advanced Materials and 3D Printing are in the process of being commercialized, and there are new business opportunities with identified markets and customers.The Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment will also pursue partnership opportunities to commercialize functional materials and printed electronics technologies.  These partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak efforts to further develop such technologies into products. The Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment also provides a wide range of analytical services to external clients at market rates.   •Advanced Materials:  •Advanced Materials is developing solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories.  There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category.  Currently, the primary focus is on light blocking particles for the textile market. •3D Printing:  •3D Printing concentrates on partnership and/or licensing opportunities in micro 3D printing solutions such as printed electronics.  In addition, for macro 3D printing AM3D manufactures and sells a specialty material to a 3D printing customer. •IP Licensing:  •Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses.  While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment still carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses.Eastman Business ParkThe Eastman Business Park segment includes the operations of the Eastman Business Park, a more than 1,200-acre technology center and industrial complex in Rochester, New York and the leasing activities related to that space. A large portion of this facility is used in Kodak’s own manufacturing and other operations, while the remaining portion is occupied by external tenants or available for rent to external tenants.  Two tenants represented approximately 40% of total Eastman Business Park segment revenues in 2019.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak include the Flexographic Packaging business.  Refer to Note 29, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.6RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to eighteen months prior.  Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials from a broad range of suppliers.  While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSEquipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”). It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control. Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2019, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 4,922 people globally, of whom approximately 2,116 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.7ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in its securities risky.  You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies Kodak’s assessment of the most significant factors which may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position, stock price or future financial performance.  Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.Risks Related to Kodak’s BusinessIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected. Kodak’s business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. In addition, Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships.Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak’s business.The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business. The positive cash flow from operations generated by Kodak in 2019 were derived from working capital improvements and individual transactions which occurred during the year and are not expected to be recurring.  Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with monetization transactions over the past several years and, based on forecasted cash flows, there are uncertainties regarding its ability to meet commitments in the U.S. as they come due.  The Print segment is its largest segment and has had declining revenues and segment earnings which are expected to continue to decline. Kodak’s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses.  It may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.  If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations with proceeds from monetization transactions, its ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the 5% Secured Convertible Notes (the “Convertible Notes”) and the 5.50% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements. Its film manufacturing facilities are aged and without significant updates to equipment and systems will be more prone to failure.  Capital improvements are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology.  The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. There are no assurances:  •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.8If Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs. If Kodak is unable to successfully develop, fund and commercialize products in certain businesses upon which it is focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, its financial performance could be adversely affected. Kodak has focused its investments in Print, Advanced Materials, and Chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet and electrophotography, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals, and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or that its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing its investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.Due to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. In the case of aluminum and other raw materials and components imported by Kodak, tariffs imposed from time to time may give rise to future cost increases.  Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity. The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, including as a result of the global outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19.  Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity.  In particular, if the coronavirus has a significant impact on the printing industry it could adversely impact the demand for Kodak’s products.  There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, including as a result of the coronavirus, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) held a referendum in which voters opted for the country’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, Consistent with the outcome of this referendum, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020.  Thus, the UK is no longer a member of the EU; however, the UK will continue to be subject to EU rules and remain a member of the single market and customs union during an implementation period. The implementation period runs to December 31, 2020 but may be extended for up to two years. The UK government is negotiating with the EU on trade and other terms for such exit. Leaving without any agreement on such terms would lead to disruption to UK/EU trade. However, Kodak has put appropriate plans in place for continuity of supply and purchase of products, although there is likely to be some limited cost impact associated with these plans.The uncertainty concerning Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries. This uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with the Company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside Kodak’s control but may cause it to adjust its strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  9If Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products or do so in a timely manner, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.Kodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards.Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to: •identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; •commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time; •differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings; •price its products and services competitively; •anticipate its competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; •work successfully alongside its partners; and •control product quality in its manufacturing processes.As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, UltraStream technology, new generations of Sonora offset plates, and small particle technology) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed. In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services it must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak’s products are critical to its business.  Kodak’s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering.  One aspect of Kodak’s business is licensing others to use Kodak’s brand in connection with the sale of such licensees’ products and services, and activities by such licensees may be perceived by the market as being activities of Kodak.  The success of Kodak’s brand can suffer if its or its licensees’ marketing plans, product initiatives or activities do not have the desired impact on the brand’s image or ability to attract customers.  Kodak’s results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak, its licensees or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the brand.  Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its corporate values and commitments that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak’s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.Increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may: 10 •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than it does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position. The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm its business. In order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. Kodak serves imaging/print needs for business markets, including graphic communications, packaging, enterprise services, and printed electronics. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.Kodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities.  If its investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.    11Kodak makes investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.  New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue.Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to: •develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products; •maintain an adequate control environment; •quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products; •obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or •mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions.Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with its suppliers could adversely affect its liquidity.  There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with its financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and its supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of its key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on its sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19 emanating from China in December 2019 and spreading throughout many regions of the world has resulted in travel restrictions to and from affected regions, disruptions to suppliers’ performance and delivery, in some cases whether or not based in affected regions, as well as the temporary shutdown of many businesses in affected regions. Kodak has manufacturing, service and sales operations in affected regions, including China, Germany and Italy, and regularly imports and exports products into and out of the affected regions. Kodak also relies on: •certain third-party suppliers and vendors in affected regions for goods and services to support its global business operations; •customers whose need for Kodak products is based on manufacturing operations in affected regions; •suppliers, some of which are based in affected regions, to transport products into and out of affected regions; •companies operating outside affected regions who obtain critical raw materials or components from affected regions to supply Kodak; •the shooting, production and release of motion picture films in or dependent on affected regions; and •royalties from brand licensees that source products from or sell products in affected regions.12Certain of Kodak’s critical business functions, including its manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak’s employees to physically work at its or its customers locations due to government restrictions, health concerns or illness may disrupt its operations, perhaps significantly.  Kodak has already experienced some disruptions in its manufacturing and logistics operations due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The full extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts Kodak’s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of this filing, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Complications from the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business operations and our results of operations and financial position, particularly if such complications have an extended duration.In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. Kodak has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results. As part of Kodak’s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives.  In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses.  Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which it undertakes or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the benefits sought to be achieved from such strategic transactions.  If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.Kodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay. Kodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including: •the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business; •potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control; •wrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in its expenses and working capital requirements; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.Any of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.13Cyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak’s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about its workforce, its customers, or other third parties could disrupt its business, harm its reputation, cause it to lose customers, and expose it to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation. To effectively manage Kodak’s global business, it depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running its business.Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about its business, including intellectual property and confidential information of its customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks or defects in its systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to its business or its reputation.  Kodak has system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect its IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of its operations or disclosure of confidential information, but it may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these threats to its internal information systems or those of its third-party providers.  A breach of Kodak’s security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of its information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its business.Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to its customers, and operates services used by its customers and hosted by Kodak, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of its security or reliability measures, or those of its third-party service providers, could negatively impact its customers’ operations or data privacy.Attacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. It has programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, Kodak may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences. Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Kodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and it periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of its policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that its employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of its policies for which it may be ultimately responsible, or that its policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak’s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage its reputation and have a materially adverse effect on its results of operation or financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition. Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in its role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018 for all European Union (“EU”) member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those previously in place and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020 and many other states are in various stages of implementing privacy legislation. The CCPA provides California residents with specific privacy rights including a new private right of action for certain data breaches. 14Recently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to its business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on its ability to obtain and process information and allegations by its customers and clients that it has not performed its contractual obligations. At the same time, the risk of cyber-attacks is relevant to the requirements regarding storage, transfer, sharing and handling of personal information.  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across its businesses and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted. A key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States.Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.  Also, some of Kodak’s business and some of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks and require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted and its reputation harmed by its licensees’ activities.  Also, failure by Kodak and its licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business: •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products; •even if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. 15Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow. Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect its results of operations.Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also determined the fair value of its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company’s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations. Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak’s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  If Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.Kodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels with various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.  16Kodak’s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets. Because Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as: •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.There can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products.  Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak’s properties may impact its ability to further develop or sell such properties.Kodak may have additional tax liabilities. Kodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak’s worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the course of its business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.  Management’s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.Kodak’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters.Kodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, remediations and proceedings concerning:  commercial, tax, tort, customs, employment, health and safety and intellectual property matters, licensee activities, and compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries. 17As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain.  Kodak filed its most recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report for the reporting period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 on May 31, 2019.  As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country.  Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, it may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the ABL Credit Agreement or the Convertible Notes could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any default or event of default occurs under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  If applicable, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.On March 6, 2020 Kodak obtained a waiver from the agent and lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to any event of default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement that may be deemed to occur in relation to the going concern explanatory paragraph contained in the audit report on Kodak’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that Kodak will be able to obtain such a waiver if a going concern explanatory paragraph is contained in the audit report with respect to Kodak’s annual financial statements for future years.  In the absence of such a waiver, the agent or lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement may take the position that such explanatory paragraph constitutes a default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement.  For more information on the reporting covenants under the Credit Agreements and the potential impact of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report refer to Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity.”Kodak may require additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to it and/or may be limited. Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets is limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time or unattractive cost.  The Company has issued approximately $80 million and $85 million of letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The maturity date of the ABL Credit Agreement is May 26, 2021.  Upon the earlier of the maturity date or the termination of the revolving credit commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement, the obligations thereunder will become due and the Company will need to provide alternate collateral in place of the letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Agreement.Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: •covenants in the ABL Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes; •obtaining a consent from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock; •investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates; •its financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of its subsidiaries; •its levels of debt and redemption obligations, including the maturity of the Convertible Notes on November 1, 2021, unless extended in accordance with their terms, and the mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on November 15, 2021; •its ability to generate positive cash flow; •its ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales; •its requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •its credit ratings;18 •its long-term business prospects; and •general economic and capital market conditions.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital is likely to limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In particular, Kodak does not have committed refinancing or the liquidity to meet the debt obligations under the Convertible Notes and ABL Credit Agreement or the redemption obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms, and there are no assurances Kodak will be able to amend, extend, refinance or repay the loans under the Convertible Notes, the redemption obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock or, as necessary, its obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement before they become due.  If Kodak is unable to amend, extend or refinance the obligations under the Convertible Notes, ABL Credit Agreement or Series A Preferred Stock before they become due, its ability to continue as a going concern would likely be impaired.The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral. The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future.  In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies.  Its credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.In carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations, including any mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock, or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with a higher or investment grade rating or stronger financial condition. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  In particular, given the Company’s current credit ratings it would be required, if requested, to provide up to $13 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash. Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment and Eligible Cash less specified reserves as described in Note 9, “Debt and Finance Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past four years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $80 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $15 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement,  the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.  Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs.If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur under these circumstances if neither of these alternatives were achieved. The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.The Company’s indebtedness under the Convertible Notes and ABL Credit Agreement and its other obligations including the potential mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following: •it may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Convertible Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred; •it could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, refinancing or other purposes; •it will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt or Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.19The Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects, or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.Risks Related to the Company’s Common StockThe conversion of the Convertible Notes or the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 314.9785 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, and the 2,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 5.7471 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock.  As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock, the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2020, the conversion of all Convertible Notes would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 42% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion, the conversion of all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion, and the conversion of all Convertible Notes and all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 50% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion.  Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Notes and Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Convertible Notes or shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Notes or shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes own a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities and have the right to nominate two members to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These holders currently hold approximately 30% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. These holders also hold all of the Convertible Notes.  If the holders converted all of the Convertible Notes, the holders would hold approximately 56% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis and such conversion may constitute a change in control of the Company.  As a result, these holders may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.  The Company and these holders are parties to a Shareholder Agreement that contains certain restrictions on disposition or acquisition of Company securities and other actions by these holders, some of which restrictions will expire on April 17, 2020.Further, for as long as they hold any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate for election (collectively and not individually) at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders a number of directors to the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) commensurate with their ownership percentage of common stock on an as-converted basis. Two of the Company’s current Board members were nominated by these current holders, who also have the right to fill vacancies on the Board created by one of their nominees ceasing to serve on the Board. The nomination and other rights regarding the Board granted to the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not transferrable to any other person. Also, whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more dividend periods, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting with holders of all other classes of preferred stock of the Company whose voting rights are then exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors at the Company’s next annual meeting and all subsequent meetings until all accumulated dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock have been paid or set aside (during which time the number of directors the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate under the Purchase Agreement will be reduced by two). As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock or elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would enable such current holders or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board. As of February 1, 2020, the Company is in arrears for four dividend payments.20The Company has registered the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock. In compliance with two Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of 20,723,050 shares of outstanding common stock, 2,000,000 shares of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, and 11,494,200 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.  The Company is also a party to a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which it is obligated under defined circumstances to register for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities registered for resale or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company’s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.The Company has registered the resale of securities representing approximately 59% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and, if it is required to register the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes, the Company will have registered the resale of securities representing approximately 74% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes.   Although the holders of the subject securities consist of several unaffiliated groups, these holders collectively have a controlling influence over all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of subject securities collectively would be able to cause a change of control of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions including the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes, the conversion of such securities, the redemption, refinancing, extension or amendment of the Series A Preferred Stock, or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 18, “Income Taxes”.  The interests of the holders of the securities registered for resale may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, its strategic initiatives, its sales and profitability, and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations and sales of large blocks of its common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially"

Kodak also offers brand licensing and intellectual property opportunities, provides products and services for motion pictures and other commercial films, and sells ink to its existing installed consumer inkjet printer base.Kodak’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which assumes Kodak will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSKodak has six reportable segments:  Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Software and Solutions, Consumer and Film, Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology and Eastman Business Park.  Print SystemsThe Print Systems segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, which offers high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology.  The Print Systems segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.  While the businesses in this segment are experiencing pricing pressure, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion.Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as Computer to Plate (“CTP”) equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates. Prices for aluminum have risen over the past year, in part due to strong global demand and more recently due to the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of high aluminum prices through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives.  In January 2019, Kodak received exemptions on U.S. tariffs for aluminum. The Print Systems products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.  •Prepress Solutions: •Digital offset plates, which includes KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, the plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.3 •CTP output devices that are used by customers to transfer images onto aluminum offset printing plates and provide consistent and high-quality imaging for offset press applications. CTP products provide high resolution, consistency and stability in thermal imaging. Kodak also offers a lower cost CTP system using TH5 imaging technology, which provides a highly efficient and cost-effective imaging solution at a lower price point. •Net sales for Prepress Solutions accounted for 58% of Kodak’s total net revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.•Electrophotographic Printing Solutions: •NEXPRESS printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products. •DIGIMASTER printers use monochrome electrophotographic printing technology for transactional printing, short-run books, corporate documentation, manuals and direct mail. •Net sales for Electrophotographic Printing Solutions accounted for 10% of Kodak’s total net revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.The Print Systems segment also provides service and support related to these products.Enterprise Inkjet SystemsThe Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment contains the Prosper business and the Versamark business. The Enterprise Inkjet Systems products include production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components and services.  Enterprise Inkjet Systems products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that the Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels.  Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh, and Screen.   •Prosper: •The Prosper business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging.  PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage.  The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service. •The focus of the Prosper business is on developing the next generation platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in original equipment manufacturers (OEM) as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.  The Prosper business secured its first agreement in the fourth quarter of 2018 with an industry OEM, who will integrate Ultrastream in a packaging press solution. •The Prosper business includes Kodak Print Services.  Kodak Print Services prints the Jersey Evening Post as well as the majority of U.K. national newspapers for distribution in both Jersey and Guernsey islands.  The business is used to demonstrate the value of the Kodak Prosper presses to customers around the world. •Versamark: •The KODAK VERSAMARK Products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER Press.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press systems.  Users of KODAK VERSAMARK Products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak.  Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.Net sales for Enterprise Inkjet Systems accounted for 10% of Kodak’s total net revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.   Software and SolutionsThe Software and Solutions segment is comprised of Unified Workflow Solutions and Kodak Technology Solutions, which includes enterprise services and solutions.  Unified Workflow Solutions is an established product line whereas Kodak Technology Solutions includes Kodak Services for Business (“KSB”) and Kodakit.  Sales in Kodak Technology Solutions are project-based and can vary from year to year depending on the nature and number of projects in existence that year.  4•Unified Workflow Solutions:  •Unified Workflow Solutions offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak systems and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output.  Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process.  Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with systems sold to many of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world.  The Unified Workflow Solutions business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency.  Products and services are sold directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that Unified Workflow Solutions serves are highly competitive.  Key customer segments each face competitive market pressure in pricing and new product introduction.  Primary competitors include Heidelberg, Agfa, Fuji, and Esko. •Kodak Technology Solutions:  •KSB assists organizations with challenges and opportunities created by the worldwide digital transformation.

Prolonged trade disputes with increasing tariffs could have incremental negative impacts on material costs. •Consumer Products: •Includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties.  Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including batteries, digital and instant print cameras and camera accessories, printers, and LED lighting.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. •Consumer Inkjet Solutions, which involves the sale of ink to an existing installed base of consumer inkjet printers. •3rd party sales of specialty inks and dispersions. •Kodak developed consumer products. •Industrial Film and Chemicals: •Offers industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards, as well as professional and consumer still photographic film •Includes related component businesses: Polyester Film; Solvent Recovery; and Specialty Chemicals. •Motion Picture: •Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers. •Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offering onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe.5Net sales for Motion Picture and Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 12% and 11% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Advanced Materials and 3D Printing TechnologyThe Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment contains the Kodak Research Laboratories and associated new business opportunities and intellectual property licensing not directly related to other business divisions.  Kodak conducts research and files patent applications with fundamental inventions from the Kodak Research Laboratories.  Additionally, Kodak continues to file new patent applications in areas aligned with its core businesses.  Via these core business patent applications along with the research inventions, Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.  Because product solutions in Advanced Materials and 3D Printing are in the process of being commercialized or are new business opportunities, a higher-level of investment has been required.  Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology significantly reduced the level of this investment in the fourth quarter of 2017, concentrating on opportunities that are commercialized or nearly commercialized with identified markets and customers. The Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment will also pursue partnership opportunities to commercialize materials and printed electronics technologies.  These partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak efforts to further develop such technologies into products.  Further, the Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment provides a wide range of analytical services and non-recurring engineering services to external clients at market rates for such services.   •Advanced Materials:  •Advanced Materials is developing solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories.  There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category, but the singular focus now is light blocking particles for the textile market. •3D Printing:  •3D Printing concentrates on partnership and/or licensing opportunities in printed electronics (micro 3D printing) and materials production for macro 3D printing companies. •IP Licensing:  •Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses.  While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment still carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses.Eastman Business ParkThe Eastman Business Park segment includes the operations of the Eastman Business Park, a more than 1,200-acre technology center and industrial complex in Rochester, New York and the leasing activities related to that space. A large portion of this facility is used in Kodak’s own manufacturing and other operations, while the remaining portion is occupied by external tenants or available for rent to external tenants.  Three tenants represented approximately 50% of total Eastman Business Park segment revenues in 2018.  A tenant that represented approximately 20% of segment revenues for the year ending December 31, 2018 did not renew its lease upon expiration in the third quarter of 2018.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak include the Flexographic Packaging business.  Refer to Note 27, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.6RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to one year prior.   Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials from a broad range of suppliers.  Most electronic components, raw materials and other components are generally available from multiple sources.  However, certain key electronic components, raw materials and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSEquipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as flexographic and lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2018, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 5,400 people globally, of whom approximately 2,300 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.7ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies Kodak’s assessment of the most significant factors which may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.Risks Related to Kodak’s BusinessIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.Kodak’s business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. In addition, Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak’s business. If Kodak cannot successfully manage and complete the divestiture of the Flexographic Packaging Division, the Company’s strategic objectives and financial condition could be adversely impacted, as well as Kodak’s ability to meet debt obligations including compliance with debt covenants and other commitments as they become due.  On November 11, 2018, Kodak entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Flexographic Packaging Division to Montagu Private Equity LLP.  The transaction is expected to close as early as April 8, 2019, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.  The net proceeds from the transaction will be used by Kodak to reduce outstanding term debt. The Company expects that the remaining outstanding term debt will be refinanced and/or repaid using cash proceeds from capital-raising activities.  Successfully executing and completing the divestiture transaction may be costly, difficult, and time consuming, and may require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business obligations. The divestiture transaction may not close within the expected timeframe, which could impact Kodak’s ability to meet debt obligations and compliance with debt covenants. We could also experience greater dis-synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated. Kodak makes no assurances regarding the likelihood, certainty or timing of consummating any asset sales, including the Flexographic Packaging Division, refinancing of the Company’s existing debt, or regarding the sufficiency of any such actions to meet Kodak’s debt obligations, including compliance with debt covenants, and to eliminate substantial doubt about Kodak’s ability to continue as a going concern.The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business.Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows over the past five years and, based on forecasted cash flows, there are uncertainties regarding its ability to meet commitments in the U.S. as they come due.  The Print Systems segment is its largest segment and has had declining revenues and segment earnings which are expected to continue to decline.  Kodak expects to close the sale of its Flexographic Packaging Division which has been growing.  Kodak’s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses.  It may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.  If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations with proceeds from the sale of businesses or assets or other monetization transactions, its ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.8Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on its indebtedness and Series A Preferred Stock, or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. There are no assurances:  •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to generate expected levels of operational EBITDA; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.If Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs.  In addition, if it were able to incur additional debt, the risks associated with the Company’s substantial leverage, including the risk it will be unable to service its debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund its liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements, could significantly increase.Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results. As part of Kodak’s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives.  In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses, particularly following the sale of the Flexographic Packaging Division. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which it undertakes or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the benefits sought to be achieved from such strategic transactions.  If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.If Kodak is unable to successfully develop, fund and commercialize products in certain businesses upon which it is focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, its financial performance could be adversely affected.Kodak has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging, advanced materials and 3D printing, and software and services.  Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for it to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or that its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If it is unsuccessful in growing Kodak’s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.Kodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay.Kodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:  •the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business; •potential loss of key employees;9 •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control; •wrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in its expenses and working capital requirements; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.Any of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.Due to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. In the case of aluminum, recently imposed tariffs may give rise to future cost increases.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity.The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) held a referendum in which voters opted for the country’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit and, accordingly, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on April 12, 2019 (unless delayed). The UK government has been negotiating with the EU on terms for such exit but no agreement has yet been reached. Leaving without any agreement on terms would lead to disruption to UK/EU trade. However, we have put appropriate plans in place for continuity of supply and purchase of products, although there is likely to be some limited cost impact associated with these plans. The prospect of Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries. This uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with our company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside of our control but may cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.If Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products or do so in a timely manner, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.Kodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to: 10  •identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; •commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time; •differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings; •price its products and services competitively; •anticipate its competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; •work successfully alongside its partners; and •control product quality in its manufacturing processes.As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, UltraStream technology, small particle technology and Ultra NX) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed.In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services it must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak’s products are critical to its business.  Kodak’s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering.  One aspect of Kodak’s business is licensing others to use Kodak’s brand in connection with the sale of such licensees’ products and services, and activities by such licensees may be perceived by the market as being activities of Kodak.  The success of Kodak’s brand can suffer if its or its licensees’ marketing plans, product initiatives or activities do not have the desired impact on the brand’s image or ability to attract customers.  Kodak’s results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak, its licensees or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the brand.  Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its corporate values and commitments that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak’s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.The competitive pressures it faces could harm Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may:  •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than it does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.11As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position.The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.The loss of one or more of Kodak’s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm its business.In order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.Kodak serves imaging needs for business markets, including packaging, graphic communications, enterprise services, and printed electronics. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.Kodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities.  If its investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services. Kodak makes sizeable investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue.  12Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to:  •develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products; •maintain an adequate control environment; •quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products; •obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or •mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions.Suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Any significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with its suppliers could adversely affect its liquidity.  There is a risk that Kodak’s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with its financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak’s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and its supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of its key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on its sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. It has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. Kodak could be adversely impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion, insider threats or otherwise, or other significant disruption of its IT networks and related systems or of those it operates for certain of its customers.To effectively manage Kodak’s global business, it depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak’s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running its business.Kodak’s IT systems contain critical information about its business, including intellectual property and confidential information of its customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks or defects in its systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to its business or its reputation.  Kodak has system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect its IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of its operations or disclosure of confidential information, but it may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these threats to its internal information systems or those of its third-party providers.  A breach of Kodak’s security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of its information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its business.13Kodak also provides IT-based products and services to its customers, and operates services used by its customers and hosted by Kodak, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of its security or reliability measures, or those of its third-party service providers, could negatively impact its customers’ operations or data privacy.Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. It has programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, Kodak may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak’s business.  Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Kodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and it is continuously in the process of reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of its policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that its employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of its policies for which it may be ultimately responsible, or that its policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak’s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage its reputation and have a materially adverse effect on its results of operation or financial condition. Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak’s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in its role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018 for all European Union (“EU”) member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those previously in place and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. This change, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to its business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on its ability to obtain and process information and allegations by its customers and clients that it has not performed its contractual obligations. At the same time, the risk of cyber-attacks is relevant to the requirements regarding storage, transfer, sharing and handling of personal information.  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across its businesses and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.    14If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.A key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.  Also, much of Kodak’s business and many of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks and require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted and its reputation harmed by its licensees’ activities.  Also, failure by Kodak and its licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue. In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business: •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products; •even if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.15Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect its results of operations.Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also determined the fair value of its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company’s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations.Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak’s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  If Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.Kodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels with various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.Kodak’s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets.Because Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:  •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;16 •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.There can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products.  Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York Empire State Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company’s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park or from discharges to the Genesee River through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The settlement agreement was implemented on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company’s environmental obligations may impact its ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park.Kodak may have additional tax liabilities. Kodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak’s worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the course of its business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) may continue to require the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. Many aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the 2017 Tax Act, and as Kodak gathers more information and performs more analysis, Kodak’s results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.  Management’s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.Kodak’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters.Kodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, remediations and proceedings concerning:  commercial, tax, tort, customs, employment, health and safety and intellectual property matters, licensee activities, and compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.17Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain.  Kodak filed its most recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report for the reporting period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 on May 31, 2018.  As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country.  Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, it may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”) or the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement” and, together with the Term Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any default or event of default occurs and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.The lenders under the Term Credit Agreement may take the position that the going concern explanatory paragraph contained in the audit report on Kodak’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not satisfy the reporting covenant under the Term Credit Agreement.  Under the Term Credit Agreement, if notice of a failure to comply with the reporting covenant is given to Kodak by the lenders, an event of default would occur thereunder if such failure is not cured within thirty days after such notice is given, unless such event of default is waived by the requisite lenders.  On March 31, 2019 Kodak obtained a waiver from the agent and lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to any event of default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement that may be deemed to occur in relation to the going concern explanatory paragraph in the audit report. Such waiver does not waive any cross-default that may occur in the event of the occurrence of an event of default under the Term Credit Agreement, as described above.  For more information on the reporting covenants under the Credit Agreements and the potential impact of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity.”The combination of covenant requirements in the Term Credit Agreement and Kodak’s on-going investment in growth businesses, a decline in Strategic Other Business or an accelerated decline in its Planned Declining Business or continuing softness and volatility of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, could make it difficult for the Company to satisfy the leverage covenants under the Term Credit Agreement on an on-going basis.The Company is obligated to comply with a number of financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements.  Kodak intends to conduct its operations in a manner which will result in continued compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenants under the Term Credit Agreement; however, compliance for future quarters may depend on Kodak undertaking one or more non-operational transactions, such as a monetization of assets, a debt refinancing, the raising of equity capital, or a similar transaction. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance and does not make alternate arrangements with its term lenders, an event of default would occur under the Credit Agreements which, among other remedies, would entitle the lenders or their agents to declare the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreements to be immediately due and payable.We may require additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets is limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time or unattractive cost. The loans made under the Term Credit Agreement become due on the earlier to occur of (i) the maturity date of September 3, 2019 or (ii) the acceleration of such loans following the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement).  The Company has issued approximately $85 million and $96 million of letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  18Should the Company not repay, refinance or extend the maturity of the loans under the existing Term Credit Agreement prior to June 5, 2019, the termination date will occur under the ABL Credit Agreement on such date unless the ABL Credit Agreement has been previously amended.  Upon the occurrence of the termination date under the ABL Credit Agreement, the obligations thereunder will become due and the Company will need to provide alternate collateral in place of the letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Agreement.Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:  •covenants in the Credit Agreements; •obtaining a consent from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock; •investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates; •its financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; •its levels of debt and redemption obligations, including the mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on November 15, 2021; •its ability to complete the sale of its Flexographic Packaging Division;  •its ability to consummate other asset sales or monetization transactions; •its ability to generate positive cash flow; •its requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •its credit ratings; •its cash flow; •its long-term business prospects; and •general economic and capital market conditions.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital is likely to limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In particular, Kodak does not have committed refinancing or the liquidity to meet the debt obligations under the Term Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms, and there are no assurances Kodak will be able to amend, extend, refinance or repay the loans under the Term Credit Agreement or, as necessary, its obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement before they become due.  If Kodak is unable to amend, extend or refinance the Term Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement before they become due, its ability to continue as a going concern would likely be impaired.The current non-investment grade status and Kodak’s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. Its credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.In carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations, including any mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock, or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with a higher or investment grade rating or stronger financial condition. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  In particular, given the Company’s current credit ratings it would be required, if requested, to provide up to $13 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash.Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment and Eligible Cash less specified reserves as described in Note 9, “Debt and Capital Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past four years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $85 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $18.75 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.  Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash, would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs and could not be used in determining the Net Secured Leverage Ratio under the Term Credit Agreement.  19If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur under these circumstances if neither of these alternatives were achieved. The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to pay interest, dividends and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and its other obligations including the potential mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following:  •it may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred; •it could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, refinancing or other purposes; •it will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt or Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on it.The Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.Risks Related to the Company’s Common StockThe conversion of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.The 2,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 5.7471 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of March 1, 2018, the conversion of all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Series A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock own a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities and have the right to nominate two members to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These holders currently hold approximately 30% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, these holders may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.  The Company and these holders are parties to a Shareholder Agreement that contains certain restrictions on disposition or acquisition of Company securities and other actions by these holders, some of which restrictions will expire on April 17, 2020.Further, for as long as they hold any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate for election (collectively and not individually) at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders a number of directors to the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) commensurate with their ownership percentage of common stock on an as-converted basis. Two of the Company’s current Board members were nominated by these current holders, who also have the right to fill vacancies on the Board created by one of their nominees ceasing to serve on the Board. The nomination and other rights regarding the Board granted to the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not transferrable to any other person. 20Also, whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more dividend periods, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting with holders of all other classes of preferred stock of the Company whose voting rights are then exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors at the Company’s next annual meeting and all subsequent meetings until all accumulated dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock have been paid or set aside (during which time the number of directors the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate under the Purchase Agreement will be reduced by two). As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock or elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would enable such current holders or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board. As of April 1, 2019, the Company is in arrears for two dividend payments.The Company has registered the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock.In compliance with two Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of 20,723,050 shares of outstanding common stock, 2,000,000 shares of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, 11,494,200 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, and 863,804 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities registered for resale could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.The Company has registered the resale of securities representing approximately 60% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or the exercise of the warrants corresponding to shares of common stock registered for resale.  Although the holders of the subject securities consist of several unaffiliated groups, these holders collectively have a controlling influence over all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of subject securities collectively would be able to cause a change of control of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions including the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 17, “Income Taxes”.  The interests of the holders of the securities registered for resale may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.The Company’s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, its strategic initiatives, its sales and profitability, and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations and sales of large blocks of its common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially.The market price of the Company’s common stock may be affected by the volatility of blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.The trading price of the Company’s common stock has been dramatically affected by the announcement of the license granted by Kodak to WENN Digital, Inc. (“WENN”) to use Kodak’s brand in connection with WENN’s KODAKOne blockchain-based image rights management platform and Kodak-branded cryptocurrency.  Kodak may, in the future, have other involvement relating to blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, either directly or as a licensor.  Kodak cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will continue to be affected by blockchain or cryptocurrency markets and any volatility in such markets"

Kodak also offers brand licensing and intellectual property opportunities, provides products and services for motion pictures and other commercial films, and sells ink to its existing installed consumer inkjet printer base.The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSKodak has seven reportable segments:  Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Flexographic Packaging, Software and Solutions, Consumer and Film, Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology and Eastman Business Park.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other which primarily represents the RED utilities variable interest entity until deconsolidation in December 2016 (refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).Information on Kodak's revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area as well as revenues and earnings by reportable segment for each of the past three years are shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.Print SystemsThe Print Systems segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, which offers high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner based technology.  The Print Systems segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.  While the businesses in this segment are experiencing pricing pressure, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion.Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as Computer to Plate (“CTP”) equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.The Print Systems products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.  •Prepress Solutions: •Digital offset plates, which includes KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, the plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices. •CTP output devices that are used by customers to transfer images onto aluminum offset printing plates and provide consistent and high-quality imaging for offset press applications. CTP products provide high resolution, consistency and stability in thermal imaging. Kodak also offers a lower cost CTP system using TH5 imaging technology, which provides a highly efficient and cost-effective imaging solution at a lower price point. •Net sales for Prepress Solutions accounted for 53%, 52% and 51% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.3•Electrophotographic Printing Solutions: •NEXPRESS printers produce high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications, such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products. •DIGIMASTER printers use monochrome electrophotographic printing technology for transactional printing, short-run books, corporate documentation, manuals and direct mail. •Net sales for Electrophotographic Printing Solutions accounted for 9%, 9% and 10% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Print Systems segment also provides service and support related to these products.Enterprise Inkjet SystemsThe Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment contains the Prosper business and the Versamark business. The Enterprise Inkjet Systems products include production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components and services.  Enterprise Inkjet Systems products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that the Enterprise Inkjet Systems segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels.  Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh, and Screen.   •Prosper:  •The Prosper business product offerings, including the PROSPER Press systems and PROSPER Components, feature ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. This includes the PROSPER 6000 Press, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail and packaging.  PROSPER System Components are integrated into original equipment manufacturer partner products and systems. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and, therefore, the amount of ink usage.  The business model is further supplemented by consumption of other consumables including refurbished jetting modules and service.  •The focus of the Prosper business is on developing the next generation platform, Ultrastream, with solutions that place writing systems in original equipment manufacturers as well as direct sale press products that widens its reach into applications for packaging and décor and expands the substrate range to include plastics.  Product development is currently in the stage of shipping evaluation kits to potential partners with commercialization expected in 2019.   •The Prosper business includes Kodak Print Services.  Kodak Print Services prints the Jersey Evening Post as well as the majority of U.K. national newspapers for distribution in both Jersey and Guernsey islands.  The business is used to demonstrate the value of the Kodak Prosper presses to customers around the world. 4•Versamark: •The KODAK VERSAMARK Products are the predecessor products to the PROSPER Press.  Kodak has ceased manufacturing VERSAMARK Press systems.  Users of KODAK VERSAMARK Products continue to purchase ink and other consumables as well as service from Kodak.  Applications of the VERSAMARK products include publishing, transactional, commercial print and direct mail.  Flexographic PackagingThe Flexographic Packaging segment includes flexographic imaging equipment, printing plates, consumables and related services, which enable graphic customization of a wide variety of packaging materials.  Flexographic Packaging seeks to provide innovative printing techniques to customers for both premium marketing applications and manufacturing applications. Flexographic Packaging products are sold directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The industry is highly competitive.  The most significant competitors are Esko-Graphics BVBA and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. for imaging equipment and Asahi Kasei Corporation, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Flint Group S.A., Fuji, MacDermid Incorporated, Toray Industries, Inc. and Toyobo Co., Ltd. for consumables. Competition is based on quality, technology, performance, price, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products and services, and service and support.•FLEXCEL NX:  •The FLEXCEL NX System, a fully-integrated digital flexographic plate imaging solution, enables prepress service providers and printers to create printing plates that provide high quality flexographic printing and enhance the efficiency of customers’ printing processes.   •Other Packaging  •The FLEXCEL SR Plates portfolio comprises a full range of analog flexographic plates designed for trade shops and packaging printers that have not yet transitioned to digital technology. Kodak also manufactures and sells DITR Film, a no-process alternative to conventional graphic arts film and a wide range of analog and digital letterpress plates. Also included under this category are equipment service and the legacy APPROVAL proofing business.  Software and SolutionsThe Software and Solutions segment is comprised of Unified Workflow Solutions and Kodak Technology Solutions, which includes enterprise services and solutions.  Unified Workflow Solutions is an established product line.  Kodak Technology Solutions includes document management and managed print services businesses and Kodakit.  Sales in Kodak Technology Solutions are project-based and can vary from year to year depending on the nature and number of projects in existence that year.  •Unified Workflow Solutions  •Unified Workflow Solutions offers a leading suite of solutions for print production workflow, including the PRINERGY workflow production software, by providing customer value through automation, web integration and integration with other Kodak systems and third-party offerings. Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output.  Production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process.  Kodak believes it is a leader in production workflow solutions for the commercial print and packaging industries with over 15,000 systems installed in some of the largest printing and packaging establishments around the world.  The Unified Workflow Solutions business includes digital front-end controllers which manage the delivery of personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency.  Products and services are sold directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  The markets that Unified Workflow Solutions serves are highly competitive.  Key customer segments each face competitive market pressure in pricing and new product introduction.  Primary competitors include Heidelberg, Agfa, Fuji, and Esko. •Kodak Technology Solutions  •Kodak Technology Solutions assists organizations with challenges and opportunities created by the worldwide digital transformation. It provides print and managed media services that assist customers with solutions for their printing requirements and document management services, including expertise in the capture, archiving, retrieval and delivery of documents. Kodak Technology Solutions serves enterprise customers primarily in the government and financial services sectors.  Digitization and document management services are provided by a variety of players, both global and local, in a market that varies significantly in terms of quality and pricing of services provided.  Kodakit is a platform that connects businesses with professional photographers to cater to their photography needs.  Customers include global hotels and online travel agencies, real estate companies, marketplaces, advertising agencies and global brands.5Consumer and FilmThe Consumer and Film segment is comprised of three lines of business, Consumer Products, Industrial Film and Chemicals, and Motion Picture.  Kodak’s Consumer and Film products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.  Brand licensees use the Kodak brand on their products and use their own distribution channels.  Two Industrial Film and Chemicals customers represent approximately 30 percent of total Consumer and Film segment revenues.•Consumer Products:  •Includes licensing of the Kodak brand to third parties.  Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of products including batteries, digital and instant print cameras and camera accessories, printers, and LED lighting.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of brand licenses to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments. •Consumer Inkjet Solutions, which involves the sale of ink to an existing installed base of consumer inkjet printers. •Kodak developed consumer products, including the Super 8 camera. •Industrial Film and Chemicals:  •Offers industrial film, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards, as well as professional and consumer still photographic film. •Includes related component businesses: Polyester Film; Solvent Recovery; and Specialty Chemicals, Inks and Dispersions. •Motion Picture:  •Includes the motion picture film business serving the entertainment industry. Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, external laboratories and independent filmmakers. •Kodak motion picture film processing laboratories offering onsite processing services at strategic locations in the U.S. and Europe.Net sales for Motion Picture and Industrial Film and Chemicals accounted for 10% of Kodak’s total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.Advanced Materials and 3D Printing TechnologyThe Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment contains the Kodak Research Laboratories and associated new business opportunities and intellectual property licensing not directly related to other business divisions.  Kodak conducts research and files patent applications with fundamental inventions from the Kodak Research Laboratories.  Additionally, Kodak continues to file new patent applications in areas aligned with its core businesses.  Via these core business patent applications along with the research inventions, Kodak maintains a large worldwide portfolio of pending applications and issued patents.  Because product solutions in Advanced Materials and 3D Printing are in the process of being commercialized or are new business opportunities, a higher-level of investment has been required.  Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology significantly reduced the level of this investment in the fourth quarter of 2017, concentrating on opportunities that are commercialized or nearly commercialized with identified markets and customers. Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment will also pursue partnership opportunities to commercialize materials and printed electronics technologies.  These partnerships may include non-recurring engineering payments for Kodak efforts to further develop such technologies into products.  Further, Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology segment provides a wide range of analytical services and non-recurring engineering services to external clients at market rates for such services.   •Advanced Materials:  •Advanced Materials is developing solutions for component smart materials based on the materials science inventions and innovations from the research laboratories.  There are multiple applications that Kodak contemplates addressing in this category, but the singular focus now is light blocking particles for the textile market. •3D Printing:  •3D Printing concentrates on partnership and/or licensing opportunities in printed electronics (micro 3D printing) and materials production for macro 3D printing companies.   6•IP Licensing:  •Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and its ongoing businesses.  While revenues from these licensing activities tend to be unpredictable in nature, this segment still carries the potential for revenue generation from intellectual property licensing and new materials businesses.Eastman Business ParkThe Eastman Business Park segment includes the operations of the Eastman Business Park, a more than 1,200-acre technology center and industrial complex in Rochester, New York and the leasing activities related to that space. A large portion of this facility is used in Kodak’s own manufacturing and other operations, while the remaining portion is occupied by external tenants or available for rent to external tenants.  Three tenants represent approximately 50% of total Eastman Business Park segment revenues.  A tenant that represented approximately 30% of segment revenues for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, and 35% of segment revenues for the year ending December 31, 2015 notified Kodak that it does not plan to renew its lease upon expiration in the third quarter of 2018.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak include the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging businesses (“PI/DI Business”).  Refer to Note 25, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREAFinancial information by geographic area for the past three years is shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied, and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to one year prior.   Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials from a broad range of suppliers.  Polymer and resin raw materials are used in the manufacture of flexographic printing plates and films.  Most electronic components, raw materials and other components are generally available from multiple sources.  However, certain key electronic components, raw materials and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSEquipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTKodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including the specific technologies previously discussed, such as flexographic and lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.Total research and development expenses were $53 million in 2017, $60 million in 2016 and $61 million in 2015.7ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2017, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 5,800 people globally, of whom approximately 2,600 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies Kodak’s assessment of the most significant factors which may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.Risks Related to Kodak’s BusinessIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.Kodak’s business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. In addition, Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak’s business. If Kodak is unable to successfully develop, fund and commercialize products in certain businesses upon which it is focused, its financial performance could be adversely affected.Kodak has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging, advanced materials and 3D printing, and software and services.  Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for it to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or that its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If it is unsuccessful in growing Kodak’s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.8Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results. As part of Kodak’s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives.  In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.Kodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay.Kodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:  •the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business; •potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in its expenses and working capital requirements; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.Any of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.The ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business.Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows over the past four years.  The Print Systems segment is its largest segment and has had declining revenues and segment earnings which are expected to continue to decline.  Kodak’s stable and growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows.  Kodak may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on its indebtedness and Series A Preferred Stock, or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. There are no assurances:  •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to generate expected levels of operational EBITDA; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or9 •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.If Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs.  In addition, if it were to incur additional debt, the risks associated with the Company’s substantial leverage, including the risk it will be unable to service its debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund its liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements, could significantly increase.Due to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, it is subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity.The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.If Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.Kodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to:  •identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; •commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time; •differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings; •price its products and services competitively; •anticipate its competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; •work successfully alongside its partners; and •control product quality in its manufacturing processes.10As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, UltraStream technology, small particle technology and Ultra NX) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed.In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services it must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak’s products are critical to its business.  Kodak’s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering.  One aspect of Kodak’s business is licensing others to use Kodak’s brand in connection with the sale of such licensees’ products and services, and activities by such licensees may be perceived by the market as being activities of Kodak.  The success of Kodak’s brand can suffer if its or its licensees’ marketing plans, product initiatives or activities do not have the desired impact on the brand’s image or ability to attract customers.  Kodak’s results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak, its licensees or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the brand.  Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its corporate values and commitments that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak’s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.The competitive pressures it faces could harm Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may:  •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than it does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.11An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position.The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.If Kodak cannot attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees, its revenue and earnings could be harmed.In order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.Kodak serves imaging needs for business markets, including packaging, graphic communications, enterprise services, and printed electronics. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.Kodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities.  If its investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services. Kodak makes sizeable investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to:  •develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products; •maintain an adequate control environment;12 •quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak’s products; •obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or •mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions.Further, even if Kodak honors its payment and other obligations to its key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms. In addition, it may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. It has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.Cyber-attacks or disruptions to our information technology (IT) environment could impact revenue, operations, cost, and competitiveness.To effectively manage our global business, we depend on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt our operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.Our IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks or defects in our systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to our business or our reputation.  We have system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect our IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of our operations or disclosure of confidential information, but we may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these threats to our internal information systems or those of our third-party providers.  A breach of our security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also provide IT-based products and services to our customers, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers’ operations or data privacy.Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm Kodak’s reputation.Kodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in its role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will become effective on May 25, 2018 for all European Union (EU) member states. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those currently in place, and will include significant penalties for non-compliance. This change, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to its business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on its ability to obtain and process information and allegations by its customers and clients that it has not performed its contractual obligations. At the same time, the risk of cyber-attacks is relevant to the requirements regarding storage, transfer, sharing and handling of personal information.  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across its businesses and 13geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.A key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.  Also, much of Kodak’s business and many of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks and require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted and its reputation harmed by its licensees’ activities.  Also, failure by Kodak and its licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of these companies are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business:  •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products; •even if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.14Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect its results of operations.Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also fair valued its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company’s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations.Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak’s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  If Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.Kodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels with various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.Kodak’s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets.Because Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:  •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;15 •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.There can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products.  Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York Empire State Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company’s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park or from discharges to the Genesee River through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The settlement agreement was implemented on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company’s environmental obligations may impact its ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park.Kodak may have additional tax liabilities. Kodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak’s worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the course of its business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within Kodak, the use of provisional estimates in its financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. Many aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the 2017 Tax Act, and as Kodak gathers more information and performs more analysis, Kodak’s results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.  Management’s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.Kodak’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters.Kodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, remediations and proceedings concerning:  commercial, tax, tort, customs, employment, health and safety and intellectual property matters, licensee activities, and compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.16Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain.  Kodak filed its most recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report for the reporting period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 on May 31, 2017.  As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals, but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country.  Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, it may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Term Credit Agreement”) or the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement” and, together with the First Lien Term Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any event of default occurs and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans, and if applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect the Company’s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.The combination of covenant requirements in the First Lien Term Credit Agreement and Kodak’s on-going investment in growth businesses, and continuing softness and volatility of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, could make it difficult for the Company to satisfy the leverage covenants under the First Lien Term Credit Agreement on an on-going basis.The Company is obligated to comply with a number of financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements.  Kodak intends to conduct its operations in a manner which will result in continued compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenants under the First Lien Term Credit Agreement; however, compliance for future quarters may depend on Kodak undertaking one or more non-operational transactions, such as a monetization of assets, a debt refinancing, the raising of equity capital, or a similar transaction. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance and does not make alternate arrangements with its term lenders, an event of default would occur under the Credit Agreements which, among other remedies, would entitle the lenders or their agents to declare the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreements to be immediately due and payable.The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash.Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment and Eligible Cash less specified reserves as described in Note 8, “Debt and Capital Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past four years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $96 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $19 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.  Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash, would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs and could not be used in determining the Net Secured Leverage Ratio under the First Lien Term Credit Agreement.  If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur under these circumstances if neither of these alternatives were achieved. The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to pay interest, dividends and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.17The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and its other obligations including the potential mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following:  •it may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred; •it could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, refinancing or other purposes; •it will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt or Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on it.The Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.Kodak’s access to the capital markets may be limited.Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit ratings, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets may be limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time or unattractive cost. The maturity date of the loans under the First Lien Term Credit Agreement is September 3, 2019, and such loans must be refinanced, repaid or extended by such date.  Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:  •covenants in the Credit Agreements; •obtaining a consent from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock; •investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates; •its financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; •its levels of debt and redemption obligations, including the mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on November 15, 2021; •its ability to generate positive cash flow; •its requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •its credit ratings; •its cash flow; •its long-term business prospects; and •general economic and capital market conditions.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The current non-investment grade status may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. Its credit ratings may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.In carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, the current non-investment grade credit ratings may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations, including any mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock, or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.  In particular, if the Company’s credit ratings were to decline it would be required to provide up to $19 million of letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.18Risks Related to the Company’s Common StockThe conversion of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock.The 2,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 5.7471 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of March 1, 2018, the conversion of all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Series A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock own a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities and have the right to nominate two members to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These holders currently hold approximately 30% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, these holders may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.  The Company and these holders are parties to a Shareholder Agreement that contains certain restrictions on disposition or acquisition of Company securities and other actions by these holders, some of which restrictions will expire on April 17, 2020.Further, for as long as they hold any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate for election (collectively and not individually) at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders a number of directors to the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) commensurate with their ownership percentage of common stock on an as-converted basis. Two of the Company’s current Board members were nominated by these current holders, who also have the right to fill vacancies on the Board created by one of their nominees ceasing to serve on the Board. The nomination and other rights regarding the Board granted to the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not transferrable to any other person. Also, whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more dividend periods, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting with holders of all other classes of preferred stock of the Company whose voting rights are then exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors at the Company’s next annual meeting and all subsequent meetings until all accumulated dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock have been paid or set aside (during which time the number of directors the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate under the Purchase Agreement will be reduced by two). As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock or elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would enable such current holders or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board.The Company has registered the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock.In compliance with two Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of 20,723,050 shares of outstanding common stock, 2,000,000 shares of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, 11,494,200 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, and 863,804 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities registered for resale could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.19The Company has registered the resale of securities representing approximately 60% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or the exercise of the warrants corresponding to shares of common stock registered for resale.  Although the holders of the subject securities consist of several unaffiliated groups, these holders collectively have a controlling influence over all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of subject securities collectively would be able to cause a change of control of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions including the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 14, “Income Taxes”.  The interests of the holders of the securities registered for resale may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.The market price of the Company’s common stock may be volatile and such volatility may be affected by the volatility of blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.The trading price of the Company’s common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the risk factors described above and other factors which are beyond Kodak’s control.  The trading price of the Company’s common stock has been dramatically affected by the announcement of the license granted by Kodak to WENN Digital, Inc. (“WENN”) to use Kodak’s brand in connection with WENN’s KODAKOne blockchain-based image rights management platform and Kodak-branded cryptocurrency.  Kodak may, in the future, have other involvement relating to blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, either directly or as a licensor.  Kodak cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will continue to be affected by blockchain or cryptocurrency markets and any volatility in such markets"

Kodak also offers brand licensing and intellectual property opportunities, provides products and services for motion pictures and other commercial films, and sells ink to its existing installed consumer inkjet printer base.The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSKodak has seven reportable segments:  Print Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, Consumer and Film, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Intellectual Property Solutions and Eastman Business Park.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other which primarily represents the RED utilities variable interest entity until deconsolidation in December 2016 (refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).Information on Kodak's revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area as well as revenues and earnings by reportable segment for each of the past three years are shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.Print SystemsThe Print Systems segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, which offers high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner based technology.  The Print Systems segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.  While the businesses in this segment are experiencing pricing pressure, continued innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long term market price erosion.Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as Computer to Plate (“CTP”) equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.The Print Systems products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.  •Prepress Solutions: •Digital offset plates, including KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal.

A large portion of this facility is used in Kodak’s own manufacturing and other operations, while the remaining portion is occupied by external tenants or available for rent to external tenants.  Three tenants represent over 60 percent of total Eastman Business Park segment revenuesDISCONTINUED OPERATIONSDiscontinued operations of Kodak include the PROSPER Enterprise Inkjet business and the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging businesses (“PI/DI Business”).  Refer to Note 26, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREAFinancial information by geographic area for the past three years is shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.5RAW MATERIALSThe raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied, and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to two years prior.   Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  Although most electronic components are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components included in the finished goods manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which may subject Kodak to supply risks.SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSEquipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTThrough the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in research and development.Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including the specific technologies previously discussed, such as flexographic and lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.Total research and development expenses were $40 million in 2016, $44 million in 2015 and $64 million in 2014.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2016, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 6,100 people globally, of whom approximately 2,700 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies Kodak’s assessment of the most significant factors which 6may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.Risks Related to Kodak’s BusinessThe ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business.Kodak has significantly reduced its rate of negative operating cash flow over the past three years.  The Print Systems segment is its largest segment and has declining revenues and its segment earnings are also expected to decline.  Kodak’s “stable” and “growth” business segments may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows.  Kodak may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate cash necessary to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal of, or interest on its indebtedness, or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements.Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors   beyond our control. There are no assurances: •Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; •Kodak will be able to generate expected levels of operational EBITDA; •Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; •the Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement; •Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan; •Kodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or •Future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.If Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak’s liquidity needs.  In addition, if it incurs additional debt, the risks associated with the Company’s substantial leverage, including the risk it will be unable to service its debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund its liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements, could intensify.Kodak has significantly restructured its business and implemented a new segment reporting structure. The restructured Kodak has been in effect for a limited period of time and there are no assurances Kodak will be able to successfully operate as a restructured business.Kodak has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging and functional (Micro 3D) printing solutions, and enterprise services and solutions. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for it to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If it is unsuccessful in growing Kodak’s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.If Kodak is not able to successfully implement its strategic business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if 7restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships. The business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plan or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak’s business.Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results.As part of Kodak’s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives.  For example, Kodak is in talks with prospective buyers about offers to purchase its Prosper enterprise inkjet business.  In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.Kodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay.Kodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including: •the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; •the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business; •potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control; •potential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas; •an increase in its expenses and working capital requirements; •management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and •the possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.Any of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.Due to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, it is subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.8Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak’s financial performance and liquidity.The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak’s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.If Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.Kodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to: •identify customer needs; •innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; •commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; •manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time; •differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings; •price its products and services competitively; •anticipate its competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; •work successfully alongside its partners; and •control product quality in its manufacturing processes.As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, Micro 3D printing, UltraStream technology, small particle technology and Ultra NX) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed. In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services, it must adequately address reliability, and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.If the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results. Kodak’s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak’s products are critical to its business.  Kodak’s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering. The success of Kodak’s brand can suffer if its marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on its brand’s image or its ability to attract customers. Its results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of its brand.  Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its 9corporate values that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak’s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.The competitive pressures it faces could harm Kodak’s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.The markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may: •foresee the course of market developments more accurately than it does; •sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; •have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; •have better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost; •develop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers; •adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or •have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.As a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position. The competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.If Kodak cannot attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees, its revenue and earnings could be harmed.In order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.If Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.Kodak serves imaging needs for business markets, including packaging, micro 3D printing, graphic communications and enterprise services. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak’s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.If Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.10The success of Kodak’s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak’s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.If Kodak’s investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services. Kodak makes sizeable investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak’s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak’s revenue. Kodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners. Kodak’s relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations.  To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to:  •develop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak’s products •maintain an adequate control environment •quickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak •obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or  •mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.Further, even if Kodak honors its payment and other obligations to its key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms. In addition, it may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Business disruptions could seriously harm Kodak’s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.Worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. It has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak’s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.Cyber-attacks or disruptions to our information technology (IT) environment could impact revenue, operations, cost, and competitiveness.11To effectively manage our global business, we depend on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt our operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.Our IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees.  Cyber-attacks or defects in our systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to our business or our reputation.  We have system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect our IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of our operations or disclosure of confidential information, but we may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these risks to our internal information systems or those of our third-party providers.  A breach of our security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also provide IT-based products and services to our customers, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers’ operations or data privacy. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm Kodak’s reputation.Kodak stores and processes personally-identifiable information of its employees and, in some case, its customers.  At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment.  This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls across its businesses and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.If Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted. A key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.  Also, much of Kodak’s business and many of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.Kodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks, and which require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak’s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted.  Also, failure by Kodak and its licensee to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak’s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak’s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.Kodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.In addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak’s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak’s industries and some of the companies are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios.  Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract 12settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business: •claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; •claims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products; •even if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party’s contractual obligations; and •if it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.Finally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost; any requirement to disclose Kodak’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.Kodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets resulting from the application of fresh start accounting, which could adversely affect its results of operations.Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also fair valued its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company’s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak’s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations.Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak’s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.13If Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.Kodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.Kodak’s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets.Because Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as: •support of multiple languages; •recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; •compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products; •complexity of managing international operations; •exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; •commercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition; •multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; •difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; •limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash; •limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; •complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and •political or economic instability.There can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.Kodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products.  Non-conformance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company’s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park or from discharges to the Genesee River through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The settlement agreement was implemented on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company’s environmental obligations may impact its ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park. Kodak’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters. Kodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning:  commercial, customs, employment, and intellectual property matters, as well as compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final 14adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows.Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain.  Kodak filed its Conflict Minerals Disclosure report on May 31, 2016.  As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals, but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country.  Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, it may also not be sufficiently able to verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Indebtedness and Access to Capital MarketsThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Term Credit Agreement”) or the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement” and, together with the First Lien Term Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any event of default occurs and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans, and if applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect the Company’s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.The combination of covenant requirements in the First Lien Term Credit Agreement and Kodak’s on-going investment in growth businesses, and continuing softness and volatility of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, could make it difficult for the Company to satisfy the leverage covenants under the Term Credit Agreements on an on-going basis. The Company is obligated to comply with a number of financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements.  Kodak intends to conduct its operations in a manner which will result in continued compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenants under the Term Credit Agreements; however, compliance for future quarters may depend on Kodak undertaking one or more non-operational transactions, such as a monetization of assets, a debt refinancing, the raising of equity capital, or a similar transaction. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance and does not make alternate arrangements with its term lenders, an event of default would occur under the Credit Agreements which, among other remedies, would entitle the lenders or their agents to declare the outstanding obligations under the Term Credit Agreements to be immediately due and payable.  Refer to “Risks Related to Kodak’s Business risk factor—There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities” for a description of additional risks relating to compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreements.The availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak’s cash. Availability under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment and Eligible Cash less specified reserves as described in Note 8, “Debt and Capital Leases” to the consolidated financial statements.  Kodak’s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past three years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.  If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $116 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $19 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.  Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash, would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs and could not be used in determining the Net Secured Leverage Ratio under the First Lien Term Credit Agreement.  If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company.  An event of default would occur if neither of these alternatives were achieved.15The Company’s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to pay interest, dividends and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.The Company’s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and its other obligations including the potential mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following: •it may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred; •it could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, refinancing or other purposes; •it will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt or Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and •adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on it.The Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.Kodak’s access to the capital markets may be limited. Because of Kodak’s current non-investment grade credit ratings, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets may be limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time or unattractive cost. Kodak’s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: •covenants in the Credit Agreements; •obtaining a consent from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock; •investor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates; •its financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; •its levels of debt and redemption obligations; •its ability to generate positive cash flow; •its requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; •its credit ratings; •its cash flow; •its long-term business prospects; and •general economic and capital market conditions, including the timing and magnitude of any market recovery.Kodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The current non-investment grade status may adversely impact Kodak’s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.The Company’s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. Its credit ratings may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.In carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, the current non-investment grade credit ratings may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations, including any mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock, or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.16Risks Related to the Company’s Common StockThe conversion of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company’s common stock. The 2,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 5.7471 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, the Company’s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of March 1, 2017, the conversion of all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.If Series A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.Holders of the Company’s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Series A Preferred Stock, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock own a large portion of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding securities and have the right to nominate two members to the Company’s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board. The holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company’s common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These holders currently hold approximately 22% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, these holders may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval. Further, beginning at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company and for as long as they hold any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate for election (collectively and not individually) at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders a number of directors to the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) commensurate with their ownership percentage of common stock on an as-converted basis. Accordingly, it is expected that these current holders will be able to nominate two directors to the Board at the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders, assuming they retain ownership of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any common stock into which it may be converted. These current holders also have the right to fill vacancies on the Board created by one of their designees ceasing to serve on the Board. The nomination and other rights regarding the Board granted to the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not transferrable to any other person. Also, whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more dividend periods, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting with holders of all other classes of preferred stock of the Company whose voting rights are then exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors at the Company’s next annual meeting and all subsequent meetings until all accumulated dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock have been paid or set aside (during which time the number of directors the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate under the Purchase Agreement will be reduced by two). As a result, the potential presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock or elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would enable such current holders or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board.The Company has registered, or expects to register, the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities.  The resale of the Company’s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock.In compliance with two Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of 20,723,050 shares of outstanding common stock and 863,804 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, and it expects to complete the registration of the resale of 2,000,000 shares of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and 11,494,200 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.  The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company’s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected.17The resale of a significant portion of the Company’s securities registered for resale could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.The Company has registered, or filed a registration statement with respect to, the resale of securities representing approximately 60% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or the exercise of the warrants corresponding to shares of common stock registered for resale.  Although the holders of the subject securities consist of several unaffiliated groups, these holders collectively have a controlling influence over all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of subject securities collectively would be able to cause a change of control of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company’s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions including the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, were to result in an “ownership change” as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company’s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially.  For more information on the Company’s tax attributes refer to Note 14, “Income Taxes”. The interests of the holders of the securities registered or to be registered for resale may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock"

Kodak provides commercial products and services built on its expertise in three core technologies: materials science; digital imaging science and software; and deposition processes.  Kodak’s portfolio of products and services is designed to meet the needs of customers in different sectors and cycles of the commercial imaging and printing markets. Kodak leverages its core technology products and services to develop solutions for the product goods packaging and graphic communications markets, and is commercializing products for the functional printing market. Kodak also offers brand licensing and intellectual property opportunities, provides products and services for motion pictures and other commercial films, and sells ink to its existing installed consumer inkjet printer base. The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York. EMERGENCE FROM VOLUNTARY REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS On January 19, 2012 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (the “Bankruptcy Filing”) under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) were jointly administered as Case No. 12-10202 (ALG) under the caption “In re Eastman Kodak Company.”  The Debtors operated their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court until their emergence from bankruptcy. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the “Non-Filing Entities”) were not part of the Chapter 11 Cases, and continued to operate in the ordinary course of business. On August 23, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the revised First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Eastman Kodak Company and its Debtor Affiliates (the “Plan”). On September 3, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from chapter 11 protection.Fresh Start Accounting Upon emergence from chapter 11, Kodak applied the provisions of fresh start accounting to its financial statements as of September 1, 2013. The adoption of fresh start accounting resulted in Kodak becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes.  Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements on or after September 1, 2013 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements prior to that date. References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” relate to the reorganized Kodak subsequent to the Effective Date.  References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” relate to Kodak prior to the Effective Date. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Kodak reports financial information for two reportable segments: the Graphics, Entertainment and Commercial Films Segment and the Digital Printing and Enterprise Segment.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and are composed of Kodak’s consumer film business in countries where that business has not yet transferred ownership to the KPP Purchasing Parties (as defined in Note 24, “Emergence From Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 Proceedings”, section “KPP Global Agreement” in the Notes to Financial Statements) and a utilities variable interest entity.  Effective August 31, 2013, the Company sold certain utilities and related facilities and entered into utilities supply and servicing arrangements with RED-Rochester LLC, a variable interest entity.  Kodak's sales, earnings and assets by reportable segment for each of the past three years are shown in Note 23, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.   3  Graphics, Entertainment and Commercial Films (“GECF”) Segment The GECF segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines, offset packaging (which is packaging printed using offset printing plates), motion picture entertainment, printed electronics, and industrial film markets. Graphics:  Kodak’s Graphics portfolio, covering the pre-press component of the offset printing market, includes digital plates, production workflow software, computer-to-plate equipment and digital front-end controllers. Kodak also provides services and support related to its Graphics products.  Graphics products and services are sold globally to customers both directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. ·  Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings include traditional digital offset plates and KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are offset plates that are able to be prepared directly with a computer-to-plate thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, SONORA Process Free Plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices. ·  Production workflow software is used by customers to manage digital and conventional print content from file creation to output. Kodak’s production workflow software includes KODAK PRINERGY Workflow Software, KODAK PREPS Imposition Software, KODAK COLORFLOW Software and the KODAK INSITE Software family of products. The production workflow software manages content and color, reduces manual errors and helps customers manage the collaborative creative process. ·  Computer-to-plate thermal output devices are used by customers to transfer images onto aluminum offset printing plates, and provide a consistent and high quality image carrier for offset press applications.  Kodak’s computer-to-plate products include the KODAK MAGNUS Platesetter and TRENDSETTER Platesetter with SQUARESPOT Imaging Technology, which provides high resolution, consistency and stability in thermal imaging. Kodak also offers the ACHIEVE Platesetter with TH5 imaging technology, which provides a highly efficient and cost-effective imaging solution at a lower price point. ·  Digital front-end controllers, which are branded as KODAK CREO Servers, are used by customers to drive personalized content to digital presses while controlling color and print consistency. Net sales for Graphics accounted for 54%, 52%, 49% and 49% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, four months ended December 31, 2013, eight months ended August 31, 2013 and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. Entertainment Imaging & Commercial Films:  Kodak’s Entertainment Imaging & Commercial Films group includes its motion picture film business serving the entertainment and advertising industries.  Motion picture products are sold directly to studios, laboratories and independent filmmakers. The group also offers industrial films, including films used by the electronics industry to produce printed circuit boards.  Entertainment Imaging & Commercial Films also includes related component businesses: Polyester Film, Specialty Chemicals, Inks & Dispersions, and Solvent Recovery. In January 2015 Kodak finalized new film supply agreements with major Hollywood studios.  Despite significant sales volume declines, the agreements make it possible for Kodak to continue to manufacture motion picture film while also pursuing new opportunities to leverage film production technologies in growth applications, such as touchscreens for smartphones and tablet computers. Net sales of Entertainment Imaging and Commercial Films accounted for 10%, 11%, 13% and 14% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, four months ended December 31, 2013, eight months ended August 31, 2013 and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. Intellectual Property and Brand Licensing: Intellectual Property and Brand Licensing includes licensing activities related to Kodak’s patents, proprietary technology and brand.  With respect to Brand Licensing, Kodak currently licenses its brand for use with a range of consumer products, including batteries, cameras and camera accessories and recordable media.  Kodak intends to continue efforts to grow its portfolio of consumer product licensees in order to generate both ongoing royalty streams and upfront payments.  Additionally, Kodak actively seeks opportunities to leverage its patents and associated technology in licensing and/or cross-licensing deals to support both revenue growth and ongoing businesses. Marketing and Competition: The key imperatives and marketing focus for the Graphics business are: investing in process-free technology; driving a total, optimized prepress solution; delivering the next-generation print software portfolio; expanding in emerging markets; and driving operational excellence and profitability.  Kodak faces competition from other companies that offer commercial offset and digital printing equipment, production software, consumables and service.  Competitiveness is generally focused on a broad range of technology, solutions and price. The motion picture business faces competition from electronic substitution with digital capture and digital cinema theater display. Digital Printing and Enterprise (“DP&E”) Segment DP&E serves a variety of customers in the commercial printing, packaging, newspaper, digital service bureau market, in-plant, and consumer printing market segments with a range of software, media and hardware products.  DP&E products and services are sold both directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers.   4   Digital Printing:  Digital Printing includes both Inkjet Printing Solutions and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions equipment and related consumables and service. ·  Kodak’s Inkjet Printing Solutions product offering includes the PROSPER Press and PROSPER System Hybrid Components, featuring ultrafast inkjet droplet generation. ·  The PROSPER Press features Stream Inkjet Technology, which delivers a continuous flow of ink that enables constant and consistent operation, with uniform ink droplet size and accurate placement, even at very high print speeds. Applications of the PROSPER Press include publishing, commercial print, direct mail, and packaging. The business also includes a large base of customers who continue to use KODAK VERSAMARK Products, the predecessor products to the PROSPER Press. Users of KODAK VERSAMARK Products continue to purchase ink and media consumables as well as service from Kodak. ·  PROSPER System Hybrid Components are also integrated into original equipment manufacturer partner portfolios where the manufacturer combines PROSPER Writing Systems with its press systems that transport webs of paper and other substrates through the press. Sales of equipment that incorporate the PROSPER Writing Systems result in recurring revenue from sales of ink and other consumables and equipment service. The level of recurring revenue depends on the application for which the equipment is used, which drives the total number of pages printed and ink usage. ·  Electrophotographic Printing Solutions encompasses the NEXPRESS Platform and the DIGIMASTER Production Platform. The NEXPRESS Platform offers high-quality, differentiated printing of short-run, personalized print applications such as direct mail, books, marketing collateral and photo products. The DIGIMASTER Production Platform uses monochrome electrophotographic printing technology to create high-quality printing of statements, short run books, corporate documentation, manuals and direct mail. Net sales for Digital Printing accounted for 18%, 21%, 18% and 17%, of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, four months ended December 31, 2013, eight months ended August 31, 2013 and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. Packaging and Functional Printing: Packaging and Functional Printing includes flexographic printing equipment and plates and related consumables and services, as well as printed functional materials and components. ·  The Packaging business includes Kodak’s FLEXCEL NX System and FLEXCEL Direct Platform that offer digitization into the flexographic print market. The FLEXCEL NX System uses Kodak’s proprietary SQUAREspot laser imaging technology to produce high resolution imaging that reduces waste and ink usage. The FLEXCEL Direct Platform delivers process-less high productivity and the environmental benefits of a process-less solution. These print production capabilities leverage a portfolio of offset, flexographic, and digital products and services, which help enable customers to preserve brand equity, enhance shelf appeal, and drive efficiency from design to solution. ·  The Functional Printing business leverages Kodak’s expertise in imaging and materials science and deposition processes to create products using printing processes that have previously been manufactured using traditional techniques. Functional printing offers many advantages over traditional manufacturing, including cost and environmental impact. The Functional Printing business is in a start-up phase.  Kodak’s first initiatives in Functional Printing are focusing on two separate solutions that will provide touch panel sensor films to the touchscreen industry. These solutions consist of a silver halide-based solution and an additive printing solution, which are both being commercialized in collaboration with business partners. Enterprise Services & Solutions: Enterprise Services & Solutions assists organizations with challenges and opportunities created by the worldwide digital transformation. Enterprise Services & Solutions provides print and managed media services that provide customers with solutions for their printing requirements using Kodak technologies; brand protection technologies and services to help brand owners combat counterfeiters and diverters; and document management services, including expertise in the capture, archiving, retrieval and delivery of documents. Enterprise Services & Solutions serves enterprise customers in numerous sectors, including governments, pharmaceuticals and life sciences, consumer and luxury product goods and retail and financial services. Consumer Inkjet Systems: Consumer Inkjet Systems involves the sale of ink to an existing installed base of consumer inkjet printers. Net sales for Consumer Inkjet Systems accounted for 6%, 7%, 9% and 11% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, four months ended December 31, 2013, eight months ended August 31, 2013 and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively.Marketing and Competition: The key imperatives and marketing focus for the DP&E businesses are 1) to expand the company’s position in the high-growth markets of commercial inkjet, packaging and functional printing by leveraging Kodak’s success in developing and commercializing digital printing technologies, including the SQUAREspot laser writing imaging technology and continuous Stream Inkjet Technology and 2) to partner with and provide professional services to customers in the commercial printing and digital imaging markets, supporting new customer applications and business solutions.  DP&E faces competition from other companies that offer a range of commercial offset and digital printing equipment, consumables and service. Competition is generally focused on technology, solutions and price.    5   2015 SegmentsIn 2015, Kodak implemented a new organizational structure to make the company faster-moving, more competitive and more entrepreneurial. Effective January 1, 2015, financial information will be reported for seven segments: Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, Consumer and Film, Intellectual Property Solutions and Eastman Business Park. ·  Print Systems will be comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer to plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions.·  Enterprise Inkjet Systems will include commercial inkjet printing solutions and digital front-end controllers.·  Micro 3D Printing and Packaging will be comprised of Packaging and Functional Printing.·  Software and Solutions will be comprised of Kodak Technology Solutions, which includes enterprise services and solutions, and workflow software.·  Consumer and Film will be comprised of Consumer Inkjet, Entertainment Imaging and Commercial Films, and Brand Licensing.·  Intellectual Property Solutions will include licensing and research and development activities not directly related to the other segments. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations of Kodak include the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging businesses, the digital capture and devices business, Kodak Gallery, and other miscellaneous businesses.  For details, refer to Note 27, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information by geographic area for the past three years is shown in Note 23, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.RAW MATERIALS The raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied, and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers on a spot basis or under contracts generally in place over the next one to two years.  Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  Although most electronic components are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components included in the finished goods manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which may subject Kodak to supply risks.SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS Equipment sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in research and development.   6  Research and development expenditures for Kodak’s two reportable segments were as follows:(in millions) Successor  Predecessor    Year EndedDecember 31, 2014  Four Months EndedDecember 31, 2013  Eight Months EndedAugust 31, 2013  Year EndedDecember 31, 2012               Graphics, Entertainment and Commercial Films $21  $7  $13  $40 Digital Printing and Enterprise  88   33   55   132 Impact of exclusion of certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan income from the segment measure of profitability (1)  (15)  (7)  (2)  (4)         Total $94  $33  $66  $168                   (1) Composed of interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, amortization of prior service credits related to the U.S. Postretirement Benefit Plan and special termination benefits, curtailments and settlement components of pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, except for settlements in connection with the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings that are recorded in Reorganization items, net and curtailments and settlements included in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.Research and development is headquartered in Rochester, New York.  Other U.S. groups are located in Stamford, Connecticut; Dayton, Ohio; Oakdale, Minnesota; and Columbus, Georgia.  Outside the U.S., groups are located in Canada, England, Israel, Germany, Japan and China.  These groups work in close cooperation with manufacturing units and marketing organizations to develop new products and applications to serve both existing and new markets.Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including the specific technologies previously discussed, such as flexographic and lithographic printing plates and systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems; commercial and consumer inkjet writing systems, printers, and presses; inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; dye sublimation (thermal transfer) printing systems; and color negative films, processing and papers.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONKodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.  7   EMPLOYMENTAt the end of 2014, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 7,300 people globally, of whom approximately 3,200 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.AVAILABLE INFORMATIONKodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business The Company has significantly restructured its business and adopted a new business plan, including a new segment reporting structure. The restructured Company and new business plan have been in effect for a limited period of time and there are no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully implement its business plan or successfully operate as a restructured business. The Company has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging and functional (Micro 3D) printing solutions, and enterprise services and solutions. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for us to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, our strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that our ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If we are unsuccessful in growing the Company’s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, our financial performance could be adversely affected. If Kodak is not able to successfully implement its strategic business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected. We recognize the need to rationalize Kodak’s workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with the emerged businesses and operations. We have implemented such cost rationalization plans including a restructuring of manufacturing, supply chain, marketing, sales and administrative resources. There are no assurances that such measures will prove to be successful or that the results we achieve through these plans will be consistent with our expectations. As a result, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if restructuring plans are not effectively managed, we may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to our business and customer relationships. The business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business plan or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Kodak’s inability to effectively complete and manage partnerships and other significant transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results. As part of the Company’s strategy, we may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further the Company’s strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect our financial results.   8  We may pursue acquisitions or combinations that could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future, which would adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price we would be required to pay. We may seek to enter into transactions that may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including: ·  the ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; ·  the need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our operations; ·  potential loss of key employees; ·  difficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control; ·  potential lack of operating experience in new geographic areas; ·  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; ·  management’s attention may be temporarily diverted; and ·  the possibility that we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find transactions that fit our strategic objectives or increase the price we would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder our desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our assets and operations. If the Company is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our business, financial position and operating results may suffer. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to: ·  identify customer needs; ·  innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; ·  commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; ·  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; ·  differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings; ·  price our products and services competitively; ·  anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, services or technological innovations; ·  work successfully alongside our partners, including UniPixel, Bobst and Kingsbury; and ·  control product quality in our manufacturing processes. As a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of our key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any investment we made in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results. We may not be successful in commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of our target markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position. We are in the process of commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of our target markets. We may not be successful in developing and marketing products in some or all of the areas we seek to enter in micro 3D printing. Development, production, marketing or administrative costs may exceed expectations and operating cash flow generated from these products. Customers may favor other technologies or solutions, and our products may not be competitive on the basis of cost, functionality or other characteristics. In addition, our competitors may have better technologies to which we may not have access, and may have more financial or other resources to support development and marketing of their products. We rely on our partners, such as UniPixel and Kingsbury, for technology and other expertise that are key to our efforts to commercialize micro 3D printing products. Issues with either of these companies or in our relationship with them could adversely affect our plans with respect to commercialization of our technologies. The investment required to develop products may exceed our expectations. If any or all of these risks occurred, we may not realize benefits associated with our investments in micro 3D printing, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.   9  If Kodak’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent product reliability, yield and quality issues, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed. In developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak’s products and services, we must adequately address reliability, yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because Kodak’s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results. Our ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for us to continue to operate our business. While Kodak has significantly reduced its rate of negative operating cash flow over the past two years, we continue to generate net negative operating cash flow. There is no assurance that Kodak will be able to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak’s liquidity and financial position. Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate cash necessary to finance these activities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Kodak’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on our indebtedness, or to fund Kodak’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements. Kodak’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that: ·  Kodak’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; ·  Kodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; ·  Kodak will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”); ·  Kodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan; ·  Kodak will not have to expend cash defending litigations regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or ·  future sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs. If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. We cannot assure you that any of these actions could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet the Company’s scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with the Company’s substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service the Company’s debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in our various credit facilities, could intensify. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities. A breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Term Credit Agreement”), Senior Secured Second Lien Term Credit Agreement (the “Second Lien Term Credit Agreement”, and together with the First Lien Term Credit Agreement, the “Term Credit Agreements”) or the ABL Credit Agreement (and together with the Term Credit Agreements the “Credit Agreements”) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any event of default occurs and we are not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility shall, declare all of our outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders’ commitments under that facility and cease making further loans, and if applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against our pledged assets. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.  10   Due to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak’s worldwide distribution, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. As a result of Kodak’s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales can be negatively impacted across all of the Company’s segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other major currencies. In addition, the Company’s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on our revenue and earnings. Weakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect our financial performance and liquidity. The global economic environment may adversely affect sales of our products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on our results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets that have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or that we will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers’ ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and the Company’s liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, the Company’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect the Company’s ability to meet the Company’s anticipated cash needs, impair the Company’s liquidity or increase the Company’s costs of borrowing. The competitive pressures we face could harm Kodak’s revenue, gross margins and market share. The markets in which we do business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than us. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do; sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; have better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost; develop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers; or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do or have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels that would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue and gross margins. An inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak’s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position. The competitive environment in which we operate may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers in order to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for the Company’s products and services. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If we are unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted. If the U.K. Kodak Pension Plan Purchasing Parties (“KPP Purchasing Parties”) are not able to successfully operate the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging Business (the “PI/DI Business”) acquired from the Company or meet their commitments under supply, service and transition services and other agreements entered into with the Company, the Company’s brand, reputation and financial results could suffer. The Amended and Restated Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement between Eastman Kodak Company, Qualex, Inc., Kodak (Near East), Inc., KPP Trustees Limited, as Trustee for the Kodak Pension Plan of the United Kingdom, and, solely for the purposes of Section 11.4, KPP Holdco Limited, dated August 30, 2013 (“Amended SAPA”) and certain related agreements permit the KPP Purchasing Parties to use the Kodak name and brand in its operations of the PI/DI Business on a going-forward basis. If the KPP Purchasing Parties are not successful in the operation of the PI/DI Business, the Company’s brand image and reputation as a producer of high quality products could be harmed, which could affect our financial results or operations. In addition, in connection with the closing under the Amended SAPA, on the Effective Date, the Company entered into certain supply and transition services agreements with the KPP Purchasing Parties under which the KPP Purchasing Parties are purchasing supplies and services from the Company. The inability of the KPP Purchasing Parties to make payments as they are due under the supply, service and transition service agreements could negatively affect our financial results. Further, with respect to a certain jurisdiction for which a deferred closing is expected to occur pursuant to the Amended SAPA in 2015, certain factors may delay the closing from occurring on the expected date, which could result in costs or operational impacts to Kodak.   11   If we cannot attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees, Kodak’s revenue and earnings could be harmed. In order for us to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak’s targeted growth markets, are critical to our future. We may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect our business. If we cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. We are a technology company serving imaging for business markets, including packaging, micro 3D printing, graphic communications and enterprise services. Our success in these markets depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, we must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products that we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. Our customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If we do not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. We must also effectively communicate to our customers, investors, and other key stakeholders our new business model and successfully position our products for the markets we serve. If we are unable to anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to the Company’s current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. We have outsourced a significant portion of Kodak’s overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics and back office operations and face the risks associated with reliance on third party suppliers. We have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics, customer support and administrative operations to third parties. To the extent that we rely on third party service providers, we face the risk that those third parties may not be able to: ·  develop manufacturing methods appropriate for the Company’s products; ·  maintain an adequate control environment; ·  quickly respond to changes in customer demand for the Company’s products; ·  obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or ·  mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions. Further, even if Kodak honors its payment and other obligations to its key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms. In addition, we may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier’s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, we may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of the Company’s products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers. Other supplier problems that we could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of Kodak’s contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to dependency on single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks should alternative third party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in Kodak’s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with Kodak’s customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   12  Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. We have operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China and Canada. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact our ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. These events could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, and increase our costs and expenses. If we cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which the Company’s business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted. A key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors’ products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining and enforcing Kodak’s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect Kodak’s proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of Kodak’s business and many of Kodak’s products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. We have made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and have filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect Kodak’s intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of Kodak’s licensees. There can be no assurance that Kodak’s patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect Kodak’s intellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties. In addition, third parties may claim that Kodak’s customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit our access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like ours. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business: ·  claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management’s attention and resources; ·  claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products; ·  even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations; and ·  if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. Finally, we use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, the Company could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost; any requirement to disclose the Company’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.   13  Kodak’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow. Kodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In past years, we have experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of our businesses. Kodak’s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak’s products or increases in costs during periods that are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on our results of operations. Equipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for Kodak’s products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of our key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets that limit capital investments or a weak economy that decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to manage distribution of Kodak’s products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted. We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver Kodak’s products and services, including third party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak’s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on our financial performance. Kodak’s future results could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to expand sales in emerging markets. Because we are seeking to expand our sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, and specifically in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as: ·  support of multiple languages; ·  recruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products; ·  compliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products; ·  complexity of managing international operations; ·  exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; ·  commercial laws and business practices that may favor local competition; ·  multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws; ·  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; ·  limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;   14   ·  limitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights; ·  complications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and ·  political or economic instability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of Kodak’s targeted markets. If our efforts are not successful, our business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmental permits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of Kodak’s products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the use and management of hazardous substances, or otherwise incur liabilities under such laws which in some instances can impose liability without regard to fault, then we could incur liability and/or could be prohibited or limited in the operation of certain facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws, and costs associated with the cleanup of contaminated sites, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company’s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The implementation date of the settlement agreement occurred on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company’s environmental obligations may impact our ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal matters. We have various contingencies that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning:  commercial, customs, employment, and intellectual property matters, as well as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and other laws and regulations as discussed in the “Contingencies” note in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. Regulations related to “conflict minerals” will require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak’s products. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has developed a framework and management system consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and is currently performing due diligence on our supply chain. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect our business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide “conflict-free” minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Because Kodak’s supply chain is complex, we may also not be sufficiently able to verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals, and we have developed a process to identify where such minerals originated. We filed our Conflict Minerals Disclosure report on June 2, 2014. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2013 calendar year, we were unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or adjoining country.   15  Risks Related to Our Level of Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets Our substantial monetary obligations require that a portion of our cash flow be used to pay interest and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations. Our indebtedness under our Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to us and investors in our securities. These include the following: ·  we may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt we may have incurred; ·  we could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes; ·  we will have to use a significant part of our cash flow to make payments on our debt and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and ·  adverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on us. We cannot be sure that cash generated from our business will be as high as we expect or that our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations. Our access to the capital markets may be limited. Because of our emergence from bankruptcy in 2013, our current non-investment grade credit rating, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, our access to the capital markets may be limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require us to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time. Our ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including: ·  covenants in our Credit Agreements; ·  investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate; ·  our financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries; ·  our levels of debt; ·  our ability to generate positive cash flow; ·  our requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements; ·  our credit ratings; ·  our cash flow; ·  our long-term business prospects; and ·  general economic and capital market conditions, including the timing and magnitude of any market recovery. We may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to meet our operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our current non-investment grade status may adversely impact our commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral. Our corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and we cannot assure you that our credit ratings will improve, or that they will not decline, in the future. Our credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. In carrying out our commercial business strategy, our current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that we either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business. Additionally, our current non-investment grade credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance our debt obligations or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs that would presumably be available to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced. "

6,KODK,EASTMAN KODAK CO,2012-02-29,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe Company’s filing of voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Company’s ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties.The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may lead to potential adverse effects on the Company's liquidity, results of operations, brand or business prospects.  We cannot assure you of the outcome of the Company’s chapter 11 proceeding.  Risks associated with the chapter 11 filing may impact all entities, including the Non-Filing Entities, and include the following:·  the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern;·  the Company's ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the chapter 11 cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings of the case in general;·  the length of time the Company will operate under the chapter 11 cases and its ability to successfully emerge;·  the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to develop and consummate one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the chapter 11 cases;·  the Company’s ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court and creditor approval of its reorganization plan and the impact of alternative proposals, views and objections of creditor committees and representatives, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a reorganization plan in a timely manner;·  risks associated with third party motions in the chapter 11 cases, which may interfere with the Company's plans of reorganization;·  the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the chapter 11 proceedings;·  increased costs related to the bankruptcy filing and other litigation;·  the Company's ability to manage contracts that are critical to its operation, to obtain and maintain appropriate terms with customers, suppliers and service providers;·  whether the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries continue to operate their businesses in the normal course;·  the Company’s ability to fairly resolve legacy liabilities in alignment with the Company’s plan of reorganization;·  the outcome of all pre-petition claims against the Company; and the Company’s ability to maintain existing customers, vendor relationships and expand sales to new customers.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company’s debt require a significant amount of cash and the Company’s ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control.The Company’s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, the Company’s indebtedness, or to fund the Company’s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.The Company’s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.  We cannot assure you that:·  the Company’s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;·  the Company’s plans to generate cash proceeds through the sale of non-core assets will be successful;·  the Company’s ability to generate cash proceeds through the execution of the Company’s intellectual property licensing strategies, or the potential sale of the Company’s digital imaging patent portfolios will generate sufficient cash proceeds;·  we will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;  10  ·  we will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of the Company’s chapter 11 business and restructuring plan; or·  future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund the Company’s liquidity needs.If we cannot fund the Company’s liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company’s debt; or seeking additional equity capital.   These actions may be restricted as a result of the Company’s chapter 11 filing and the DIP Credit Agreement.  Such actions could increase the Company’s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in the Company’s ability to provide products and services, reduce the Company’s ability to raise additional capital, and delay sustained profitability.  We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet the Company’s scheduled debt service obligations.   The Company’s DIP financing agreement requires that we use certain proceeds from asset sales to make payments to secured lenders.  In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with the Company’s substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service the Company’s debt or generate enough cash flow to fund the Company’s liquidity needs, could intensify.The Company’s plans to raise cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets and the potential sale of the Company’s digital imaging patent portfolio may not be successful in raising sufficient cash, may be negatively impacted by factors beyond the Company’s control and may harm the perception of us among customers, suppliers and service providers.A number of factors could influence the Company’s ability to successfully raise cash through asset sales and the sale of the Company’s digital imaging patent portfolio, including the approval of the Court and the Unsecured Creditors Committee under chapter 11, the process utilized to sell these assets, the number of potential buyers for these assets, the purchase price such buyers are willing to offer for these assets and their capacity to fund the purchase, the potential impact of an adverse judicial ruling in one of the Company’s litigation matters related to one or more of the patents in the digital imaging portfolio, or the ability of potential buyers to conclude transactions and potential issues in the closing of transactions due to regulatory or governmental review processes.  One or more of these factors could negatively affect the timing of planned asset sales and the level of cash proceeds derived from the sales which could adversely impact the Company’s cash generation and liquidity.  Further, there is no assurance that these plans will be successful in raising sufficient cash proceeds or that the sale of certain of the Company’s assets, including the digital imaging patent portfolio, will not harm the Company’s customers’, suppliers’ and service providers’ perception of us.If we are unsuccessful with the Company’s strategic investment decisions, the Company’s financial performance could be adversely affected.The Company has focused its investments on businesses in large growth markets that are positioned for technology and business model transformation, specifically, consumer inkjet, commercial inkjet (including the Company’s Prosper line of products based upon the Company’s Stream technology), packaging solutions, and workflow software and services.  While we believe each of these businesses has significant growth potential, consumer inkjet, commercial inkjet, and workflow software and services also require additional investment.  The introduction of successful innovative products and the achievement of scale are necessary for us to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve the Company’s financial objectives.  If we are unsuccessful in growing the Company’s investment businesses as planned, the Company’s financial performance could be adversely affected.The Company’s failure to implement plans to reduce the Company’s cost structure in anticipation of declining demand for certain products or delays in implementing such plans could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We recognize the need to continually rationalize the Company’s workforce and streamline the Company’s operations to remain competitive in the face of an ever-changing business and economic climate.  If we fail to implement cost rationalization plans such as restructuring of manufacturing, supply chain, marketing sales and administrative resources ahead of declining demand for certain of the Company’s products and services, the Company’s operations results, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted.  Additionally, if restructuring plans are not effectively managed, we may experience lost customer sales, product delays and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to the Company’s business and customer relationships.  The business plan associated with the Company’s chapter 11 reorganization is subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis.  If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing the Company’s plan, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute restructuring within the entities filing for chapter 11 is subject to the approval by the Unsecured Creditors Committee and Bankruptcy Court.  Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Company’s business.There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet the requirements under our Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement.In addition to standard financing covenants and events of default, the Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”) also provides for (i) a periodic delivery by the Company of various financial statements set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement and (ii) specific milestones that the Company must achieve by specific target dates.  In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are required not to  11  permit consolidated adjusted EBITDA to be less than a specified level for certain periods, and to maintain minimum U.S. Liquidity (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement).A breach of any of the covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement, or our inability to comply with the required financial covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement, when applicable, could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit agreement, subject, in certain cases, to applicable grace and cure periods.  If any event of default occurs and we are not able either to cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement, the administrative agent of the DIP Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, declare all of our outstanding obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and the agent under the DIP Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders’ commitments under the DIP Credit Agreement and cease making further loans, and if applicable, the agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against our pledged assets.  This could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. The Company’s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, future market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.We have significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.  The funded status of the Company’s U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and the related cost reflected in the Company’s financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment.  Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, and other economic and demographic factors.  Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation, pension authorities, or the Bankruptcy Court could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to the Company’s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  If we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which the Company’s business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, the Company’s revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with the Company’s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights.  Despite these measures, any of the Company’s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could, however, be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm.  Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect the Company’s proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.  Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of the Company’s business and many of the Company’s products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.The execution and enforcement of licensing agreements protects the Company’s intellectual property rights and provides a revenue stream in the form of up-front payments and royalties that enables us to further innovate and provide the marketplace with new products and services.  The Company’s ability to execute the Company’s intellectual property licensing strategies, including litigation strategies, such as the Company’s legal actions against Apple Inc. and Research in Motion Limited, could affect the Company’s revenue, earnings and liquidity.  Additionally, the uncertainty around the timing, outcome and magnitude of the Company’s intellectual property-related litigation (including the Company’s legal action against Apple Inc. and Research in Motion Limited before the International Trade Commission), judgments and settlements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, earnings, and liquidity.  A potential sale of the Company’s digital imaging patent portfolios could also result in a reduction or the cessation of license revenue related to these patents.  The Company’s failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect the Company’s market positions and business opportunities.   We have made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and have filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of the Company’s licensees.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect the Company’s intellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties.  12  In addition, third parties may claim that the Company’s customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.  Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit the Company’s access to digital markets.  Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like ours.  Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management’s attention and resources.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of the Company’s products.  Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.  If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source the Company’s revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.  Finally, we use open source software in connection with the Company’s products and services.  Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms.  As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.  Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose the Company’s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to the Company’s business results of operations and financial condition.The competitive pressures we face could harm the Company’s revenue, gross margins and market share.The markets in which we do business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants.  In certain markets where Kodak is a relatively new entrant, we have not achieved the scale of distribution of the Company’s competitors.  In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for all the Company’s products and services from numerous companies globally.  Over the past several years, price competition in the market for digital products, film products and services has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their profit margins for these products.  The Company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other Industry-wide pricing pressures.  If the Company’s products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting the Company’s revenue and gross margins.If the Company’s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent product reliability and quality issues, the Company’s product launch plans may be delayed, the Company’s financial results may be adversely impacted, and the Company’s reputation may be harmed.In developing, commercializing and manufacturing the Company’s products and services, we must adequately address reliability and other quality issues, including defects in the Company’s engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in the Company’s products.  Because the Company’s products are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines.  Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings.  Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities.  Product reliability and quality issues can impair the Company’s relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect the Company’s brand image, and the Company’s reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect the Company’s business as well as the Company’s financial results.  Product quality issues can also result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation.  13  If we cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, the Company’s revenue, earnings and cash flow, could be adversely affected.We must develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance.  If we are unable to anticipate new technology trends, for example in consumer electronics, print advertising, and commercial and consumer printing, and develop improvements to the Company’s current technology to address changing customer preferences, this could adversely affect the Company’s revenue, earnings and cash flow.  Due to changes in technology and customer preferences, the market for traditional film and paper products and services is in decline.  The Company’s success depends in part on the Company’s ability to manage the decline of the market for these traditional products by continuing to reduce the Company’s cost structure to maintain profitability.Even if a chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, continued weakness or worsening of economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the Company’s financial performance and the Company’s liquidity.The global economic recession and declines in consumption in the Company’s end markets have adversely affected sales of both commercial and consumer products and profitability for such products and was a factor leading to the Company filing for voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Further, global financial markets have been experiencing volatility.  Consumer discretionary spending may not return to pre-recession levels in certain geographies.  Continued slower sales of consumer digital products due to the uncertain economic environment could lead to reduced sales and earnings while inventory increases.  Economic conditions could also accelerate the continuing decline in demand for traditional products, which could also place pressure on the Company’s results of operations and liquidity.  While the Company is seeking to increase sales in markets that have already experienced an economic recovery such as Asia, there is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in those markets will continue in the future, or that the Company will succeed in expanding sales in these markets.  In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in the Company’s customers’ ability to pay as a result of the economic downturn, and the Company’s liquidity, including the Company’s ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions.   If the global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets continue for a greater period of time than anticipated or worsen, the Company’s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect the Company’s ability to meet the Company’s anticipated cash needs, impair the Company’s liquidity or increase the Company’s costs of borrowing.If we cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, the Company’s revenue and earnings could be harmed.In order for us to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions.  Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in the Company’s targeted growth markets, is critical to the Company’s future.   If we cannot attract qualified individuals, retain key executives and employees or motivate the Company’s employees, the Company’s business could be harmed.  The Company’s filing for chapter 11 may create additional distractions and uncertainty for employees, and impact the Company’s ability to retain key employees and effectively recruit new employees.  The Company’s ability to take measures to motivate and retain key employees may be restricted while operating under chapter 11.  We may experience increased levels of employee attrition.Due to the nature of the products we sell and the Company’s worldwide distribution, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs that may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and financial position.As a result of the Company’s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and at times, the Company’s sales can be negatively impacted across all of the Company’s segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other major currencies.  In addition, the Company’s products contain silver, aluminum, petroleum based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have been and may continue to be volatile.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on the Company’s revenue and earnings.If we are unable to provide competitive financing arrangements to the Company’s customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact the Company’s revenues, profitability and financial position.The competitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide financing to the Company’s customers in order to win a contract.  Customer financing arrangements may include all or a portion of the purchase price for the Company’s products and services.  We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources and may provide financial guarantees on behalf of the Company’s customers.  The Company’s success may be dependent, in part, upon the Company’s ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on the Company’s customers’ creditworthiness.  The tightening of credit in the global financial markets has adversely affected the ability of the Company’s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which resulted in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for the Company’s products and services, and we can provide no assurance that this trend will not continue.  If we are unable   14  to provide competitive financing arrangements to the Company’s customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact the Company’s revenues, profitability and financial position.We have outsourced a significant portion of the Company’s overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics and back office operations and face the risks associated with reliance on third party suppliers.We have outsourced a significant portion of the Company’s overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics, customer support and administrative operations to third parties.  To the extent that we rely on third party service providers, we face the risk that those third parties may not be able to:·  develop manufacturing methods appropriate for the Company’s products;·  maintain an adequate control environment;·  quickly respond to changes in customer demand for the Company’s products;·  obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or·  mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.Further, even if the Company honors its payment and other obligations to the Company’s key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms.  As a result of such risks, we may be unable to meet the Company’s customer commitments, the Company’s costs could be higher than planned, and the Company’s cash flows and the reliability of the Company’s products could be negatively impacted.  The Company will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by the Company’s suppliers.  Other supplier problems that we could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to favorable terms, the duration of the Company’s contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to dependency on single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all.  If any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming alternative third party relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in the Company’s inability to meet customer demand for the Company’s products, damage to the Company’s relationships with the Company’s customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s sales are typically concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year, therefore, lower than expected demand or increases in costs during that period may have a pronounced negative effect on the Company’s results of operations.The demand for the Company’s consumer products is largely discretionary in nature, and sales and earnings of the Company’s consumer businesses are linked to the timing of holidays, vacations, and other leisure or gifting seasons.  Accordingly, we have typically experienced greater net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared with the other three quarters.  Developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of the Company’s key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results, particularly if such developments occur late in the third quarter or during the fourth fiscal quarter.  Further, with respect to the Graphic Communications Group segment, equipment and consumable sales in the commercial marketplace peak in the fourth quarter based on increased commercial print demand.  Tight credit markets that limit capital investments or a weak economy that decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales.   In addition, the Company’s inability to achieve intellectual property licensing revenues in the timeframe and amount we anticipate could adversely affect the Company’s revenues, earnings and cash flow.  These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations.If we fail to manage distribution of the Company’s products and services properly, the Company’s revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver the Company’s products and services, including third party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers.  Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for the Company’s products and services is a complex process.  Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, the Company’s failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for the Company’s products and services could adversely affect the Company’s revenue, gross margins and earnings.  Due to changes in the Company’s go to market models, we are more reliant on fewer distributors than in past periods.  This has concentrated the Company’s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance.  15  We may be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of the Company’s goodwill and/or other long-lived assets, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability.Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.  We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Additionally, the Company’s other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Either of these situations may occur for various reasons including changes in actual or expected income or cash.  We continue to evaluate current conditions to assess whether any impairment exists.   Impairments could occur in the future if market or interest rate environments deteriorate, expected future cash flows of the Company’s reporting units decline, silver prices increase significantly, or if reporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes in respective fair values.  In the event of a sale of the Company’s digital imaging patent portfolios, licensing revenue related to those portfolios could decline significantly and materially impact the fair value of the CDG segment.The Company’s future results could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in the Company’s efforts to expand sales in emerging markets.Because we are seeking to expand the Company’s sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, and specifically in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, the Company’s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:·  supporting multiple languages;·  recruiting sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;·  complying with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for the Company’s products;·  complexity of managing international operations;·  exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;·  commercial laws and business practices that may favor local competition;·  multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, labor, and employment laws;·  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;·  limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;·  reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights;·  managing research and development teams in geographically disparate locations, including Canada, Israel, Japan, China, and Singapore;·  complicated logistics and distribution arrangements; and·  political or economic instability.There can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell the Company’s products in all of the Company’s targeted markets.  If the Company’s efforts are not successful, the Company’s business growth and results of operations could be harmed.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct the Company’s business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmental permits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of the Company’s products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of the Company’s products.  If we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the use and management of hazardous substances, then we could be subject to liability and/or could be prohibited from operating certain facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company’s inability to effectively complete, integrate and manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions could adversely impact the Company’s business performance including the Company’s financial results.As part of the Company’s business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, and outsourcing transactions and enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further the Company’s business objectives.  In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees and the assessment of such acquired companies’ internal controls.  Integration and other risks of transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further the Company’s strategic objectives, we may  16  be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenue, gross margins and profitability.  In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect the Company’s financial results"

operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures.0; If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue and gross margins.  9  If our commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent product reliability and quality issues, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.In developing, commercializing and manufacturing our

or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities.  Product reliability and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.  Product quality issues can also result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation.If we are unsuccessful with our strategic investment decisions, our financial performance could be adversely affected.We have made a decision to focus our investments on businesses in large growth markets that are positioned for technology and business model transformation, specifically, consumer inkjet, commercial inkjet (including our Prosper line of products based upon the Company’s Stream technology), packaging solutions, and workflow software and services.  We believe each of these businesses has significant growth potential.  The introduction of successful innovative products and the achievement of scale are necessary for us to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives.  If we are unsuccessful in growing our investment businesses as planned, our financial performance could be adversely affected.If we cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow, could be adversely affected.We must develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance.  If we are unable to anticipate new technology trends, for example in consumer electronics, and develop improvements to our current technology to address changing customer preferences, this could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow.  Due to changes in technology and customer preferences, the market for traditional film and paper products and services is in decline.  Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the decline of the market for these traditional products by continuing to reduce our cost structure to maintain profitability.Continued weakness or worsening of economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and our liquidity.The global economic recession and declines in consumption in our end markets have adversely affected sales of both commercial and consumer products and profitability for such products.  Further, global financial markets have been experiencing volatility.  Consumer discretionary spending may not return to pre-recession levels in certain geographies.  Continued slower sales of consumer digital products due to the uncertain economic environment could lead to reduced sales and earnings while inventory increases.  Economic conditions could also accelerate the continuing decline in demand for traditional products, which could also place pressure on our results of operations and liquidity.  While the company is seeking to increase sales in markets that have already experienced an economic recovery such as Asia, there is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in those markets will continue in the future, or that the company will succeed in expanding sales in these markets.  In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers’ ability to pay as a result of the economic downturn, and our liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions.  If the global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets continue for a greater period of time than anticipated or worsen, our profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect our ability to meet our anticipated cash needs, impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.  10  If we cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, our revenue and earnings could be harmed.In order for us to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions.  Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in our targeted growth markets, is critical to our future.   The market for experienced employees with digital skills is highly competitive and, therefore, our ability to attract such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and persuading potential employees that we are well positioned for success in the digital markets in which we are operating.  Given that our compensation plans are highly performance based and given the potential impact of the global economy on our current and future performance, it may become more challenging to retain key employees.  We also must keep employees focused on our strategic initiatives and goals in order to be successful.  Our past restructuring actions harm our efforts to attract and retain key employees.  If we cannot attract properly qualified individuals, retain key executives and employees or motivate our employees, our business could be harmed.Our future pension and other postretirement plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, future market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities  which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.We have significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.  The funded status of our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment.  Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, and other economic and demographic factors.  Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to our plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.If we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights.  Despite these measures, any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could, however, be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm.  Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position.  Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.We have made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and have filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of our licensees.  There can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties.The execution and enforcement of licensing agreements protects our intellectual property rights and provides a revenue stream in the form of up-front payments and royalties that enables us to further innovate and provide the marketplace with new products and services.  Our ability to execute our intellectual property licensing strategies, including litigation strategies, such as our legal actions against Apple Inc. and Research in Motion Limited, could also affect our revenue and earnings.  Additionally, the uncertainty around the timing, outcome and   11  magnitude of our intellectual property-related litigation (including our legal action against Apple Inc. and Research in Motion Limited before the International Trade Commission), judgments and settlements could have an adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.  Our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.  Furthermore, our failure to identify and implement licensing programs, including identifying appropriate licensees, could adversely affect the profitability of our operations.In addition, third parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.  Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit our access to digital markets.  Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like ours.  Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management’s attention and resources.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products.  Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.  If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.  Finally, we use open source software in connection with our products and services.  Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms.  As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.  Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.  Any requirement to disclose our source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.Due to the nature of the products we sell and our worldwide distribution, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and at times, our sales can be negatively impacted across all of our segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other major currencies.  In addition, our products contain silver, aluminum, petroleum based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have been and may continue to be volatile.  If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on our revenue and earnings.If we are unable to provide competitive financing arrangements to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial position.The competitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide financing to our customers in order to win a contract.  Customer financing arrangements may include all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services.  We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources and may provide financial guarantees on behalf of our customers.  Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’ creditworthiness.  The tightening of credit in the global financial markets has adversely affected the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which resulted in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services, and we can provide no assurance that this trend will not continue.  If we are unable to provide competitive financing arrangements to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial position.  12  Our sales are typically concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year, therefore, lower than expected demand or increases in costs during that period may have a pronounced negative effect on our results of operations.The demand for our consumer products is largely discretionary in nature, and sales and earnings of our consumer businesses are linked to the timing of holidays, vacations, and other leisure or gifting seasons.  Accordingly, we have typically experienced greater net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to the other three quarters.  Developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for our products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of our key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, particularly if such developments occur late in the third quarter or during the fourth fiscal quarter.  Further, with respect to the Graphic Communications Group segment, equipment and consumable sales in the commercial marketplace peak in the fourth quarter based on increased commercial print demand.  Tight credit markets that limit capital investments or a weak economy that decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales.  In addition, our inability to achieve intellectual property licensing revenues in the timeframe and amount we anticipate could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flow.  These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver our products and services, including third party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers.  Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process.  Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and earnings.  Due to changes in our go to market models, we are more reliant on fewer distributors than in past periods.  This has concentrated our credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on our financial performance.We have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics and back office operations and face the risks associated with reliance on third party suppliers.We have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics, customer support and administrative operations to third parties.  To the extent that we rely on third party service providers, we face the risk that those third parties may not be able to:·  develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products;·  maintain an adequate control environment;·  quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products;·  obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or·  mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.As a result of such risks, our costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could be negatively impacted.  Other supplier problems that we could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to duration of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to dependency on single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all.  If any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming alternative third party relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability.Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.  We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Additionally, our other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Either of these situations may occur for   13  various reasons including changes in actual or expected income or cash.  We continue to evaluate current conditions to assess whether any impairment exists.   Impairments could occur in the future if market or interest rate environments deteriorate, expected future cash flows of our reporting units decline, silver prices increase significantly, or if reporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes in respective fair values.Our failure to implement plans to reduce our cost structure in anticipation of declining demand for certain products or delays in implementing such plans could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We recognize the need to continually rationalize our workforce and streamline our operations to remain competitive in the face of an ever-changing business and economic climate.  If we fail to implement cost rationalization plans such as restructuring of manufacturing, supply chain, marketing sales and administrative resources ahead of declining demand for certain of our products and services, our operations results, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted.  Additionally, if restructuring plans are not effectively managed, we may experience lost customer sales, product delays and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to our business and customer relationships.  Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect our business.Our future results could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to expand sales in emerging markets.Because we are seeking to expand our sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, and specifically in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:·  supporting multiple languages;·  recruiting sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and support our products;·  complying with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;·  complexity of managing international operations;·  exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;·  commercial laws and business practices that may favor local competition;·  multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, labor, and employment laws;·  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;·  limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;·  reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights;·  managing research and development teams in geographically disparate locations, including Canada, Israel, Japan, China, and Singapore;·  complicated logistics and distribution arrangements; and·  political or economic instability.There can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of our targeted international markets.  If our international efforts are not successful, our business growth and results of operations could be harmed.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmental permits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of our products.  If we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the use and management of hazardous substances, then we could be subject to liability and/or could be prohibited from operating certain facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    14  Our inability to effectively complete, integrate and manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions could adversely impact our business performance including our financial results.As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions and enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives.  In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees and the assessment of such acquired companies’ internal controls.  Integration and other risks of transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.  If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profitability.  In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect our financial results.Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry.Our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.  A breach of any of the covenants contained in our Credit Agreement or our other financing arrangements, or our inability to comply with the required financial ratio in our Credit Agreement, when applicable, could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement or our other financing arrangements, subject to applicable grace and cure periods.  If any event of default occurs and we are not able either to cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the Credit Agreement and noteholders under our other financing arrangements, the administrative agent of the Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, and the trustee or the requisite noteholders under our other financing arrangements may, and at the request of the requisite noteholders shall, declare all of our outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and our other financing arrangements, respectively, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and the agent under the Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders' commitments under the Credit Agreement and cease making further loans, and if applicable, the agent and/or trustee could institute foreclosure proceedings against our pledged assets.Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing our debt require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot assure you that:·  our businesses  will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;·  our plans to generate cash proceeds through the sale of non-core assets will be successful;·  we will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;·  we will realize cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or·  future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as raising additional capital; reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling assets; restructuring or refinancing our debt; or seeking additional equity capital.  Such actions could further negatively impact our ability to generate cash flows.  We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.  Certain of our debt instruments limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition of assets and, as a result, we may not be allowed, under those instruments, to use the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.  In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs, could intensify.  15 "

liquidity.Theglobal economic recession and declines in consumption in our end markets haveadversely affected sales of both commercial and consumer products andprofitability for such products.  Further, the global financialmarkets have been experiencing volatility.  Slower sales of consumerdigital products due to the uncertain economic environment could lead to reducedsales and earnings while inventory increases.  Economic conditionscould also accelerate the continuing decline in demand for traditional products,which could also place pressure on our results of operations andliquidity.  As a result of the tightening of credit in the globalfinancial markets, our commercial customers have experienced difficulty inobtaining financing for significant equipment purchases, resulting in a decreasein, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services and we can provideno assurance that this trend will not continue.  In addition, accountsreceivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in ourcustomers’ ability to pay as a result of the economic downturn and our treasuryoperations could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrumentcounterparties, including banks and other financial institutions.  Ifthe global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets continue for agreater period of time than anticipated or worsen, our profitability and relatedcash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affectour ability to meet our anticipated cash needs, impair our liquidity or increaseour costs of borrowing.Ifwe are unsuccessful with the strategic investment decisions we have made, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected.We havemade a decision to focus our investments on businesses in large growth marketsthat are positioned for technology and business model transformation, which areconsumer inkjet, commercial inkjet (including our Prosper line of products basedupon the Company’s Stream technology), enterprise workflow, and digitalpackaging printing solutions, all of which we believe have significant growthpotential.  Introduction of successful innovative products and theachievement of scale are necessary for us to grow these businesses, improvemargins and achieve our future financial success.  We are alsocontinuing to build upon our leading positions in businesses that participate inlarge stable markets.  Our current strategic plans require significantattention from our management team and if events occur that distractmanagement’s attention and resources, our business could beharmed.  Further, if we are unsuccessful in growing our investmentbusinesses as planned and maintaining and building upon our leading marketpositions, our financial performance could be adverselyaffected. 10 Ifwe cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market newproducts to respond to changing customer preferences, this could adverselyaffect our revenues.Due tochanges in technology and customer preferences, the market for traditional filmand paper products and services is in decline.  Our success depends in parton our ability to manage the decline of the market for these traditionalproducts by continuing to reduce our cost structure to maintainprofitability.  In addition, we must develop and introduce newproducts and services in a timely manner that keep pace with technologicaldevelopments and that are accepted in the market.  Further, we mayexpend significant resources to develop and introduce new products that are notcommercially accepted for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to,failure to successfully market our products, competition from existing and newcompetitors or product quality concerns.  In addition, if we areunable to anticipate and develop improvements to our current technology, toadapt our products to changing customer preferences or requirements or tocontinue to produce high quality products in a timely and cost effective mannerin order to compete with products offered by our competitors, this couldadversely affect our revenues.Thecompetitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and marketshare.Themarkets in which we do business are highly competitive, and we encounteraggressive price competition for all our products and services from numerouscompanies globally.  Over the past several years, price competition inthe market for digital products, film products and services has beenparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and loweredtheir profit margins for these products.  Our results of operationsand financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures.  If our products and services and pricing arenot sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could alsolose market share, adversely affecting our revenue and grossmargins.Ifwe have product quality issues, our expenses may increase, our liquidity maydecrease, or our reputation may be harmed, any of which could have an adverseeffect on our business.In thecourse of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issuesassociated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering,design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party componentsincluded in our products.  Because our products are becomingincreasingly sophisticated and complicated to design and build as rapid advancesin technologies occur, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly withthe introduction of new product lines.  Although we have establishedinternal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product qualityissues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigateoccurrences of these issues and associated liabilities.  Findingsolutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may also incur expenses inconnection with, for example, product recalls and warranty or other serviceobligations.  We may also face lawsuits if our products do not meetcustomer expectations.  In addition, quality issues can impair ourrelationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brandimage, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer,which could adversely affect our business as well as our financialresults.Ifwe cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights onwhich our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate theirintellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity maybe adversely impacted.We relyupon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States andsimilar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and othertypes of agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties,to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual propertyrights.  Despite these measures, any of our direct or indirectintellectual property rights could, however, be challenged, invalidated,circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rightsmay not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends orotherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costlyproduct redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or othercompetitive harm.  Further, the laws of certain countries do notprotect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the UnitedStates.  Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable toprotect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third partycopying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitiveposition.  Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change inthe information technology industry, much of our business and many of ourproducts rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and wemay not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies fromthese third parties at all or on reasonable terms. 11 We havemade substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and have filedpatent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual propertyrights in these technologies as well as the interests of ourlicensees.  There can be no assurance that our patent applicationswill be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect ourintellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged by thirdparties.Theexecution and enforcement of licensing agreements protects our intellectualproperty rights and provides a revenue stream in the form of up-front paymentsand royalties that enables us to further innovate and provide the marketplacewith new products and services.  There can be no assurance that suchmeasures alone will be adequate to protect our intellectualproperty.  Our ability to execute our intellectual property licensingstrategies, including litigation strategies, such as our recent legal actionsagainst Apple Inc. and Research in Motion Limited, could also affect our revenueand earnings.  Additionally, the uncertainty around the timing andmagnitude of our intellectual property-related judgments and settlements couldhave an adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.  Ourfailure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adverselyaffect our market positions and business opportunities.  Furthermore,our failure to identify and implement licensing programs, including identifyingappropriate licensees, could adversely affect the profitability of ouroperations.Inaddition, third parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees or otherparties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual propertyrights.  Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block orlimit our access to digital markets.  Additionally, in recent years,individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets forthe sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extractsettlements from large companies like ours.  Even if we believe thatthe claims are without merit, the claims can be time consuming and costly todefend and distract management’s attention and resources.  Claims ofintellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affectedproducts, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costlydamage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us frommarketing or selling certain of our products.  Even if we have anagreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may beunable to uphold its contractual obligations.  If we cannot or do notlicense the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonableterms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue andearnings could be adversely impacted.  Finally, we use open sourcesoftware in connection with our products and services. Companies thatincorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time,faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliancewith open source license terms.  As a result, we could be subject tosuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open sourcesoftware or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.  Some opensource software licenses require users who distribute open source software aspart of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code tosuch software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source codeon unfavorable terms or at no cost.  We have a corporate open sourcegovernance board to monitor the use of open source software in our products andservices and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require usto disclose the source code to the related product or service or that wouldotherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement.  Such usecould inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our source code or paydamages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results ofoperations and financial condition.Ifwe are unable to provide competitive financing arrangements to our customers orif we extend credit to customerswhose creditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact our revenues,profitability and financialposition.Thecompetitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide financingto our customers in order to win a contract.  Customer financingarrangements may include all or a portion of the purchase price for our productsand services.  We may also assist customers in obtaining financingfrom banks and other sources and may provide financial guarantees on behalf ofour customers.  Our success may be dependent, in part, upon ourability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’creditworthiness.  The tightening of credit in the global financialmarkets has adversely affected the ability of our customers to obtain financingfor significant purchases, which resulted in a decrease in, or cancellation of,orders for our products and services, and we can provide no assurance that thistrend will not continue. If we are unable to provide competitive financingarrangements to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whosecreditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact our revenues,profitability and financial position. 12 Ourfuture pension and other postretirement plan costs and required level ofcontributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions,future market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislationor pension authorities  which could adversely affect our financialposition, results of operations, and cash flow.We havesignificant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitobligations.  The funded status of our U.S. and non U.S. definedbenefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and the relatedcost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors thatare subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the currenteconomic environment.  Key assumptions used to value these benefitobligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate forfuture payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on planassets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, and other economic anddemographic factors.  Significant differences in actual experience, orsignificant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislationor pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cashor assets to our plans in excess of currently estimated contributions andbenefit payments and could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations, financial position or liquidity.Ifwe cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, our business could beharmed.In orderfor us to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain and motivateexecutives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing,sales, research and support positions.  Hiring and retaining qualifiedexecutives, research professionals, and qualified sales representatives iscritical to our future.  Competition for experienced employees in theindustries in which we compete is intense.  The market for employeeswith digital skills is highly competitive and, therefore, our ability to attractsuch talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation andbenefits, work location and persuading potential employees that we are wellpositioned for success in the digital markets in which we areoperating.  Given that our compensation plans are highly performancebased and given the potential impact of the global economy on our current andfuture performance, it may become more challenging to retain keyemployees.  We also must keep employees focused on our strategicinitiatives and goals in order to be successful.  Our pastrestructuring actions harm our efforts to attract and retain keyemployees.  If we cannot attract properly qualified individuals,retain key executives and employees or motivate our employees, our businesscould be harmed.Oursales are typically concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year,therefore, lower than expected demand or increases in costs during that periodmay have a pronounced negative effect on our results of operations.Thedemand for our consumer products is largely discretionary in nature, and salesand earnings of our consumer businesses are linked to the timing of holidays,vacations, and other leisure or gifting seasons.  Accordingly, we havetypically experienced greater net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter as comparedto the other three quarters.  Developments, such aslower-than-anticipated demand for our products, an internal systems failure,increases in materials costs, or failure of one of our key logistics, componentssupply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial condition and operating results, particularly if such developmentsoccur late in the third quarter or during the fourth fiscalquarter.  Further, with respect to the Graphic Communications Groupsegment, equipment and consumable sales in the commercial marketplace peak inthe fourth quarter based on increased commercial print demand.  Tightcredit markets that limit capital investments or a weak economy that decreasesprint demand could negatively impact equipment or consumablesales.  In addition, our inability to achieve intellectual propertylicensing revenues in the timeframe and amount we anticipate could adverselyaffect our revenues, earnings and cash flow.  These externaldevelopments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on ourbusiness and results of operations.Ifwe fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, ourrevenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.We use avariety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver our products andservices, including third party resellers and distributors and direct andindirect sales to both enterprise accounts andcustomers.  Successfully managing the interaction of direct andindirect channels to various potential customer segments for our products andservices is a complex process.  Moreover, since each distributionmethod has distinct risks and costs, our failure to implement the mostadvantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services couldadversely affect ourrevenue, gross margins and earnings.  Due to changes in our go tomarket models, we are more reliant on fewer distributors than in past periods.This has concentrated our credit and operational risk and could result in anadverse impact on our financial performance. 13 Dueto the nature of the products we sell and our worldwide distribution, we aresubject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commoditycosts that may adversely impact our results of operations and financialposition.As aresult of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed tochanges in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial position.  Exchangerates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatileand at times, our sales can be negatively impacted across all of our segmentsdepending upon the value of the U.S. dollar.  In addition, ourproducts contain silver, aluminum, petroleum based or other commodity-based rawmaterials, the changes in the costs of which can be volatile.  If theglobal economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be furthervolatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodityprices, which could have negative effects on our revenue andearnings.Wehave outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing,logistics and back office operations and face the risks associated with relyingon third party suppliers.We haveoutsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing,logistics, customer support and administrative operations (such as credit andcollections, and general ledger accounting functions) to thirdparties.  To the extent that we rely on third party service providers,we face the risk that those third parties may not be able to:• developmanufacturing methods appropriate for our products;•maintain an adequate control environment;• quicklyrespond to changes in customer demand for our products;• obtainsupplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or•mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.As aresult of such risks, our costs could be higher than planned and the reliabilityof our products could be negatively impacted.  Other supplier problemsthat we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related toduration of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risksrelated to dependency on single source suppliers on favorable terms or atall.  If any of these risks were to be realized, and assumingalternative third party relationships could not be established, we couldexperience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result inour inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to ourrelationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Ourinability to effectively complete, integrate and manage acquisitions,divestitures and other significant transactions could adversely impact ourbusiness performance including our financial results.As partof our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third partiesregarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, jointventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions and enter into agreementsrelating to such transactions in order to further our businessobjectives.  In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we mustidentify suitable candidates and successfully complete transactions, some ofwhich may be large and complex, and manage post closing issues such as theintegration of acquired companies or employees and the assessment of suchacquired companies’ internal controls. Integration and other risks oftransactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicatedtransactions, or if multiple transactions are pursuedsimultaneously.  If we fail to identify and complete successfullytransactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expendresources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at acompetitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative marketperceptions, any of which may have an adverse effect on our revenue, grossmargins and profitability.  In addition, unpredictability surroundingthe timing of such transactions could adversely affect our financialresults. 14 Systemintegration issues could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.Portionsof our information technology infrastructure may experience interruptions,delays or cessations of service in connection with systems integration ormigration work that takes place from time to time.  In particular, weare in the process of completing integration of certain of our regionaloperations’ systems into our corporate SAP structure.  We may not besuccessful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could causebusiness disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive andresource intensive.  Such disruption could adversely affect ourability to fulfill orders and could also interrupt otherprocesses.  Delayed sales, higher costs or lost customers resultingfrom these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results andreputation.Businessdisruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition andincrease our costs and expenses.Ourworldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages,telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes,typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political oreconomic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or businessinterruptions, for which we are predominantly self insured.  Theoccurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenueand financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.  Inaddition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the UnitedStates, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, majorpower shortages and blackouts.  These blackouts could causedisruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributorsand resellers, or customers.  These events could seriously harm ourrevenue and financial condition, and increase our costs andexpenses.Wemay be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of ourgoodwill, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability.Goodwillrepresents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the fairvalue of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.  We testgoodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstanceschange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unitbelow its carrying amount.  This may occur for various reasonsincluding changes in actual or expected income or cash flows of a reportingunit.  We continue to evaluate current conditions that may affect thefair value of our reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairmentexists.  Secular declines in the results of the Film, Photofinishingand Entertainment Group segment are likely to lead to impairment of goodwillrelated to that segment in the future.  In addition, impairments ofgoodwill could occur in the future if market or interest rate environmentsdeteriorate, expected future cash flows of our reporting units decline, or ifreporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes inrespective fair values.Theprivate equity firm KKR may have interests that diverge from our interests andthe interests of our other security holders.KKRbeneficially owns a significant equity position in the Company through itswarrant holdings and may have interests that diverge from our interests and theinterests of our security holders.  In addition, so long as KKRmaintains beneficial ownership of specified thresholds of our shares of commonstock, it will have the right to nominate up to two members of our board ofdirectors and will be entitled to certain information rights and a right toparticipate in future offerings of our equity securities. KKR is in the businessof investing in companies and they are not restricted from investing in ourcurrent or future competitors.  Future events may give rise to adivergence of interests between KKR and us or our other securityholders.Ourfailure to implement plans to reduce our cost structure in anticipation ofdeclining demand for certain products or delays in implementing such plans couldnegatively affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position andliquidity.Werecognize the need to continually rationalize our workforce and streamline ouroperations to remain competitive in the face of an ever-changing business andeconomic climate.  If we fail to implement cost rationalization planssuch as restructuring of  manufacturing, supply chain, marketing salesand administrative resources ahead of declining demand for certain of ourproducts and services, our operations results, financial position and liquiditycould be negatively impacted.  In 2009, we implemented a targeted costreduction program, which we refer to as the 2009 Program, to more appropriatelysize the organization as a result of the economic downturn.  Whilemost of the actions 15 under the2009 Program were completed in 2009, we expect some remaining actions to becompleted during the first half of 2010.  If we fail to successfullyexecute our remaining rationalization activities under our 2009 Program, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected.  Additionally, ifthe restructuring plans are not effectively managed, we may experience lostcustomer sales, product delays and other unanticipated effects, causing harm toour business and customer relationships.  Finally, the timing andimplementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws andregulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with suchrequirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adverselyaffect our business.Theimplementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in existing laws orregulations could increase our cost to comply and consequently reduce ourprofitability.Newbusiness legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulation,including interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, couldadversely affect our results of operations by increasing our cost tocomply.  For example, new tax, labor, health care, product safety,environmental and securities laws and regulations have been proposed and suchproposals or other proposals may be enacted in the future that require us toadopt new policies, internal controls and other compliance practices or modifyexisting production facilities and operations.  Each of thesecompliance initiatives could lead to internal and external cost increases, andnegatively impact our profitability.Ourfuture results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and otherrisks associated with international sales and operations.Becausewe sell our products worldwide and many of the facilities where our devices aremanufactured, distributed and supported are located outside the United States,our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally,such as:•supporting multiple languages;•      recruiting sales and technical support personnel with the skills to      design, manufacture, sell and support our  products;•      complying with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including      obtaining required import or export approval for our    products;•complexity of managing international operations;•exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;•commercial laws and business practices that may favor localcompetition;•      multiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws,      regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax,      labor,         anti-bribery and employment laws;•difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•limitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;• reducedor limited protection of intellectual property rights;•      managing research and development teams in geographically disparate      locations, including Canada, Israel, Japan, China, and      Singapore;•complicated logistics and distribution arrangements; and•political or economic instability.While wesell our products in most parts of the world, one component of our strategy isto further expand our international sales efforts.  There can be noassurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of ourtargeted international markets. If our international efforts are not successful,our business growth and results of operations could be harmed.Ourresults of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory,and we may incur inventory-related charges.We needto manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively tomeet changing customer requirements. Accurately forecasting customers’ productneeds is difficult.  Some of our products and supplies have in thepast, and may in the future, become obsolete while in inventory due to rapidlychanging customer tastes or a decrease in customer demand.  If we arenot able to manage our inventory effectively, we may need to write down thevalue of some of our existing inventory or write off non-saleable or obsoleteinventory, which would adversely affectour results of operations.  We have from time to time incurredsignificant inventory-related charges.  Any such charges we incur infuture periods could materially and adversely affect our results ofoperations. 16 Weare subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply withsuch laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws andregulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operationsand financial condition.We aresubject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which weconduct our business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants,including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmentalpermits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardoussubstances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of ourproducts and the recycling and treatment and disposal of ourproducts.  If we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations inconnection with the use and management of hazardous substances, then we could besubject to liability and/or could be prohibited from operating certainfacilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  In addition, failure to complywith certain regulations could result in fines and civil or criminal sanctions,third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean upcosts.  We cannot provide assurance that we have been or will be atall times in complete compliance with all environmental laws, regulations andpermits.Certainenvironmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previousowners or operators of real property for the cost to investigate, remove orremediate hazardous substances.  These laws often impose liabilityeven if the owner or operator of property did not know of, or was notresponsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.  These lawsand regulations also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardoussubstances to be sent to disposal, reclamation or treatment facilities when suchfacilities are found to be contaminated.  Such persons can beresponsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated thecontaminated facility.  At December 31, 2009, we had accruedliabilities of $102 million for various environmental matters.  Themajority of this reserve relates to contamination at our Eastman Business Parksite in Rochester, New York.  Certain other costs relate to liabilityat Superfund sites, including the Passaic River in the state of NewJersey.  While the accrued liabilities represent our current bestestimate of costs for those matters, the ultimate costs could exceed thatamount.Environmentallaws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to becomemore stringent over time.  We cannot assure you that our costs ofcomplying with current and future environmental laws and regulations and ourliabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardoussubstances (including our liability for the matters comprising our environmentalreserve) will not adversely affect our business, results of operations orfinancial condition.Oursubstantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our debtobligations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage in ourindustry.We haveincurred significant debt and related interest expenses as a result of theissuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 10.5% 2017Senior Notes and $400 million of our 7.00%  Convertible Senior Notesdue 2017 in September 2009 and previously issued debt.  In addition,we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital,product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances,capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, subject to therestrictions contained in our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing thenotes and in any other agreements under which we incurindebtedness.Oursignificant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect ourability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage ofpotential business opportunities.  For example, our high level of debtpresents the following risks:·  we      are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations      to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the      availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital      expenditures, product development efforts, acquisitions, investments and      strategic alliances and other general corporate requirements as well as      making it more difficult for us to make payments on the    notes;·  our      substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and      adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a      competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are      less leveraged; 17 ·  our      debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or      reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our      ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for      operations or capital in the future and implement our business      strategies;·  our      level of debt and the covenants within our debt instruments may restrict      us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working      capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic      acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate      requirements; and·  covenants      in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay dividends, issue new or      additional debt or make other restricted payments and      investments.A failureto comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments couldresult in events of default under such instruments, which could permitacceleration of our various outstanding notes.  Any required repaymentof our indebtedness as a result of acceleration would lower our current cash onhand such that we would not have those funds available for use in ourbusiness.  In addition, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to payall such amounts in the event of an acceleration.If we areat any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to serviceour indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt torenegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek torefinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additionalfinancing.  There can be no assurance that we will be able tosuccessfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possibleor that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorableor acceptable to us.Servicingour debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cashmay be affected by factors beyond our control.Ourbusiness may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to paythe principal of, or interest on, our indebtedness, or to fund our otherliquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, productdevelopment efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, andother general corporate requirements.Ourability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond ourcontrol.  We cannot assure you that:·  our      business will generate sufficient cash flow from    operations;·  we      will realize cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements      resulting from the execution of our long-term strategic plan;      or·  future      sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable      us to fund our liquidity needs.If wecannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducingor delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategicacquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring orrefinancing our debt, including the notes, or seeking additional equitycapital.  Such actions could further negatively impact our ability togenerate cash flows.  We cannot assure you that any of these remediescould, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, orthat they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt serviceobligations.  Certain of our debt instruments limit the use of theproceeds from any disposition of assets and, as a result, we may not be allowed,under those instruments, to use the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfyall current debt service obligations.  In addition, if we incuradditional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, includingthe risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flowto fund our liquidity needs, could intensify. 18 Restrictionsimposed by our debt instruments limit our ability to finance futureoperations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may bein our interest.Our debtinstruments impose operating and other restrictions on us and oursubsidiaries.  Our debt instruments also limit, among other things,the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to:·  incur      additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred  stock;·  create      liens;·  pay      dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital      stock;·  purchase      or redeem capital stock;·  make      certain investments or other restricted  payments;·  sell      assets;·  enter      into transactions with affiliates;and·  effect      a consolidation or merger.However,these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications andexceptions.Ifthe excess availability under our Credit Agreement falls below $100 million fora specified period, the Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain compliancewith a fixed charge coverage ratio.  Our ability to comply with thiscovenant may be affected by events beyond our control.A breachof any of the covenants contained in our Credit Agreement or our inability tocomply with the required financial ratio, when applicable, could result in adefault under the Credit Agreement.  If an event of default occurs andwe are not able to obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the CreditAgreement, the administrative agent of the Credit Agreement may, and at therequest of the requisite lenders shall, declare all of our outstandingobligations under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees,to be immediately due and payable, and may terminate the lenders’ commitmentsthereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedingsagainst our assets"
8,KODK,EASTMAN KODAK CO,2009-02-27,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS    Recenteconomic trends could continue to adversely affect our financialperformance.Theglobal economic recession and declines in consumption in the Company’s endmarkets have adversely affected sales of both commercial and consumer productsand profitability for such products.  Further, the global financialmarkets have been experiencing extreme disruption in recentmonths.  Slower sales of consumer digital products due to thedeteriorating economic environment could lead to reduced sales and earningswhile increasing inventory.  Economic conditions could also acceleratethe continuing decline in demand for traditional products, which could alsoplace pressure on Kodak’s results of operations and liquidity.  Therecent tightening of credit in the global financial markets could adverselyaffect the ability of our commercial customers to obtain financing forsignificant equipment purchases, which could result in a decrease in, orcancellation of, orders for our products and services.  In addition,accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in ourcustomers’ ability to pay as a result of the recent economicdownturn.  In response to these circumstances, the Company may have totake other actions to conserve or generate cash, which may impact our ability toreturn cash to shareholders.Ourfuture pension and other postretirement plan costs and required level ofcontributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptionsand future market performance of plan assets which could adversely affect ourfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flow.We havesignificant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitobligations.  The funded status of the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and therelated cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by variousfactors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly inthe current economic environment.  Key assumptions used to value thesebenefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discountrate for future payment obligations, the long-term expected rate of return onplan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rate, and other economic anddemographic factors.  Significant differences in actual experience orsignificant changes in future assumptions could lead to a potential future needto contribute cash or assets to our plans in excess of currently estimatedcontributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on theCompany's consolidated results of operations,  financialposition or liquidity.Ifwe are unsuccessful with the strategic investment decisions we have made, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected.TheCompany has selected certain of its businesses as “core investments” because oftheir large, sustainable growth potential.  Introduction of successfulinnovative products and the achievement of scale in those businesses arenecessary for the Company to achieve its future financial success.  Inaddition, the Company has identified certain of its businesses that requirebusiness model transformations to improve margins or maximizecash.  Such business model changes could include repositioning throughstrategic partnerships.  If the Company is unsuccessful in growing thecore investment businesses as planned or in executing the transformations thatare necessary in certain of its businesses, the Company’s financial performancecould be adversely affected.Ifwe fail to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Secured CreditAgreement, our ability to meet our financial obligations or access externalfinancing could be impaired under certain circumstances.There areaffirmative, negative and financial covenants contained in the Company’s SecuredCredit Agreement.  These covenants are typical for a secured creditagreement of this nature.  The Company’s failure to comply with thefinancial covenants would result in a default under the Secured CreditAgreement.  If an event of default were to occur and not be waived bythe lenders, then all outstanding debt, interest and other payments under theSecured Credit Agreement could become immediately due and payable, any unusedborrowing availability under the revolving credit facility of the Secured CreditAgreement could be terminated by the lenders, and cash collateralization or asimilar remedy could be required for all letters of credit.  Thefailure of the Company to repay any accelerated debt for borrowed money underthe Secured Credit Agreement could result in acceleration of the majority of theCompany’s unsecured outstanding debt obligations under certaincircumstances.  The Company was in full compliance with the financialcovenants as of December 31, 2008.  Based on the Company’s currentfinancial forecast, it is reasonably likely that the Company could breach itsfinancial 11 covenantsin the first quarter of 2009 unless an appropriate amendment or waiver isobtained.  The Company is currently negotiating with its lenders toensure continued access to a Secured Credit Agreement, with the goal to have anamended credit facility in place by the end of the first quarter.  AtDecember 31, 2008, there was no debt outstanding and there were $131 million ofletters of credit issued, which are not considered debt for borrowed money underthe agreement, but do reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity under the SecuredCredit Agreement.  Notwithstanding the Company’s view that it canoperate for the foreseeable future without additional external financing, theCompany’s liquidity could be impaired if it is not able to access a creditfacility.Ifwe cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop new products torespond to changing customer preferences, this could adversely affect ourrevenues.Due tochanges in technology and customer preferences, the market for traditionalphotography products and services is in decline.  In its Film,Photofinishing and Entertainment Group, the Company continues to experiencedeclines in customer demand for film products, consistent with industrytrends.  Management has developed initiatives to address theanticipated impact of these trends on the Company’s performance.  Inaddition, the Company’s product development efforts are focused on digitalcapture devices (digital cameras and scanners) designed to improve the imageacquisition or digitalization process, software products designed to enhance andsimplify the digital workflow, output devices (thermal and inkjet printers andcommercial printing systems and solutions) and consumables designed to producehigh quality documents and images, and media (thermal and silver halide)optimized for digital workflows.  Kodak’s success depends in part onits ability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timelymanner that keep pace with technological developments and that are accepted inthe market.  The Company continues to introduce new consumer andcommercial digital product offerings.  However, there can be noassurance that the Company will be successful in anticipating and developing newproducts, product enhancements or new solutions and services to adequatelyaddress changing technologies and customer requirements.  In addition,if the Company is unable to anticipate and develop improvements to its currenttechnology, to adapt its products to changing customer preferences orrequirements or to continue to produce high quality products in a timely andcost-effective manner in order to compete with products offered by itscompetitors, this could adversely affect the revenues of theCompany.Ifwe cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights onwhich our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate theirintellectual property rights our revenue, earnings and expenses may be adverselyimpacted.Kodakrelies upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the UnitedStates and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with its employees,customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce itsintellectual property rights.  Any of the Company’s direct or indirectintellectual property rights could, however, be challenged, invalidated orcircumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient topermit the Company to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise toprovide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesignefforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitiveharm.  Further, the laws of certain countries do not protectproprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the UnitedStates.  Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable toprotect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third partycopying or use, which could adversely affect its competitiveposition.  Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change inthe information technology industry, much of our business and many of ourproducts rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and wemay not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies fromthese third parties at all or on reasonable terms.Kodak hasmade substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filedpatent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual propertyrights in these technologies as well as the interests of the Company’slicensees.  The execution and enforcement of licensing agreementsprotects the Company's intellectual property rights and provides a revenuestream in the form of royalties that enables Kodak to further innovate andprovide the marketplace with new products and services.  There is noassurance that such measures alone will be adequate to protect the Company'sintellectual property.  The Company’s ability to execute itsintellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the Company’srevenue and earnings.  Kodak’s failure to develop and properly managenew intellectual property could adversely affect the Company’s market positionsand business opportunities.  Furthermore, the Company’s failure toidentify and implement licensing programs, including identifying appropriatelicensees, could adversely affect the profitability of Kodak's operations. 12  Finally,third parties may claim that the Company or customers indemnified by Kodak areinfringing upon their intellectual property rights.  Such claims maybe made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak’s access to digitalmarkets.  Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups havebegun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of makingclaims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from largecompanies like Kodak.  Even if Kodak believes that the claims arewithout merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend anddistract management’s attention and resources.  Claims of intellectualproperty infringement also might require the Company to redesign affectedproducts, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costlydamage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting Kodakfrom marketing or selling certain of its products.  Even if theCompany has an agreement to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifyingparty may be unable to uphold its contractual agreement to Kodak.  Ifwe cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license thetechnology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from anothersource, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.Ifwe cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, our business could beharmed.In orderfor the Company to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain andmotivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial,marketing, sales, research and support positions.  Hiring andretaining qualified executives, research professionals, and qualified salesrepresentatives are critical to the Company’sfuture.   Competition for experienced employees in the industriesin which we compete can be intense.  The market for employees withdigital skills is highly competitive and, therefore, the Company’s ability toattract such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensationand benefits, work location and persuading potential employees that the Companyis well-positioned for success in the digital markets Kodak isentering.  Given the Company’s compensation plans are highlyperformance-based and given the impact of the global economy on the Company’sperformance, it may become more challenging to retain keyemployees.  The risk may be mitigated by the fact that many companiesrecently are taking actions to limit or reduce compensation and benefits inlight of the difficult economy.  The Company also must keep employeesfocused on the strategic initiatives and goals in order to besuccessful.  If we cannot attract properly qualified individuals,retain key executives and employees or motivate our employees, our businesscould be harmed.Systemintegration issues could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.Portionsof our IT infrastructure may experience interruptions, delays or cessations ofservice in connection with systems integration or migration work that takesplace from time to time; in particular, installation of SAP within our GraphicCommunications Group.  We may not be successful in implementing newsystems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and bemore expensive, time consuming, disruptive andresource-intensive.  Such disruption could adversely affect ourability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes.  Delayedsales, higher costs or lost customers resulting from these disruptions couldadversely affect our financial results and reputation.Ourinability to effectively complete, integrate and manage acquisitions,divestitures and other significant transactions could adversely impact ourbusiness performance including our financial results.As partof our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third partiesregarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, jointventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions (""transactions"") and enterinto agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our businessobjectives.  In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we mustidentify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some ofwhich may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as theintegration of acquired companies or employees.  Integration and otherrisks of transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicatedtransactions, or if multiple transactions are pursuedsimultaneously.  If we fail to identify and complete successfullytransactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expendresources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at acompetitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative marketperceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue,gross margin and profitability. 13 Delaysin our plans to reduce the cost structure of the Company through execution ofrestructuring and other actions could affect the consolidated results ofoperations, financial position and liquidity.If theCompany were to fail to successfully execute the plans within or the timing ofits current restructuring program to align the cost structure to the currenteconomic realities, the Company’s financial performance could be adverselyaffected.Wehave outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing andback-office operations and face the risks associated with relying on third partymanufacturers and external suppliers.We haveoutsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing,customer support and administrative operations (such as credit and collections,and general ledger accounting functions) to third parties and various serviceproviders.  To the extent that we rely on third party manufacturingrelationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to (1)develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, (2) maintain anadequate control environment, (3) quickly respond to changes in customer demandfor our products, (4) obtain supplies and materials necessary for themanufacturing process, or (5) mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/ordisruptions.  As a result of such risks, Kodak’s manufacturing costscould be higher than planned and the reliability of our products coulddecline.  Other supplier problems that Kodak could face includecomponent shortages, excess supply, risks related to terms of its contracts withsuppliers and risks related to dependency on single sourcesuppliers.  If any of these risks were to be realized, and assumingalternative third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, wecould experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might resultin our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage to ourrelationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Thecompetitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and marketshare.Themarkets in which we do business are highly competitive, and we encounteraggressive price competition for all our products and services from numerouscompanies globally.  Over the past several years, price competition inthe market for digital products, film and services has been particularly intenseas competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their profit margins forthese products.  In the Graphic Communications Group segment,aggressive pricing tactics by our competitors have intensified the contractnegotiation process.  Our results of operations and financialcondition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricingpressures.  If the Company is unable to obtain pricing or programssufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, Kodak could alsolose market share, adversely affecting its revenue and grossmargins.Ifwe fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, ourrevenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.TheCompany uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell our productsand services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both directand indirect sales to both enterprise accounts andcustomers.  Successfully managing the interaction of direct andindirect channels to various potential customer segments for our products andservices is a complex process.  Moreover, since each distributionmethod has distinct risks and costs, our failure to implement the mostadvantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services couldadversely affect our revenue, gross margins and earnings.  Due tochanges in the Company’s go-to-market models, the Company is more reliant onfewer distributors.  This has concentrated the Company’s credit risk,which, if not appropriately managed, could result in an adverse impact on theCompany’s financial performance.Wemay provide financing and financial guarantees to our customers, some of whichmay be for significant amounts.Thecompetitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide financingto our customers in order to win a contract.  Customer financingarrangements may include all or a portion of the purchase price for our productsand services.  We may also assist customers in obtaining financingfrom banks and other sources and may provide financial guarantees on behalf ofour customers.  Our success may be dependent, in part, upon ourability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers’creditworthiness.  As noted previously, the recent tightening ofcredit in the global financial markets could adversely affect 14 theability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, whichcould result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products andservices.  If we are unable to provide competitive financingarrangements to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whosecreditworthiness deteriorates, this could adversely impact our revenues,profitability and financial position.Dueto the nature of the products we sell and our worldwide distribution, we aresubject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commoditiescosts that may adversely impact our results of operations and financialposition.Kodak, asa result of its global operating and financing activities, is exposed to changesin currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect itsresults of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates andinterest rates in certain markets in which the Company does business tend to bevolatile.  In addition, Kodak’s products contain silver, aluminum,petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the costs of which canbe volatile.  There can be no guarantees that the global economicsituation will not worsen creating further volatility in currency exchangerates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have future negativeeffects on revenue and earnings.Ifwe cannot protect our reputation due to product quality and liability issues,our business could be harmed.Kodakproducts are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complicated to design andbuild as rapid advancements in technologies occur.  Although Kodak hasestablished internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from productquality and liability issues, there can be no assurance that Kodak will be ableto eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associateddamages.  Kodak may incur expenses in connection with, for example,product recalls, service and lawsuits, and Kodak’s brand image and reputation asa producer of high-quality products could suffer.Businessdisruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition andincrease our costs and expenses.Ourworldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages,telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes,typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other naturalor manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantlyself-insured.  The occurrence of any of these business disruptionscould seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costsand expenses.  In addition, some areas, including parts of the eastand west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and mayexperience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts.  Theseblackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the operations of oursuppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers.  These eventscould seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, and increase our costsand expenses.Theimplementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in existing laws orregulations could increase the Company’s cost to comply and consequently reduceour profitability.Newbusiness legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulation,including interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, couldadversely affect Kodak’s results of operations by increasing the Company’s costto comply.  For example, tax, labor, environmental and securities lawsand regulations may be enacted in the future that require the Company to adoptnew policies, internal controls and other compliance practices or modifyexisting production facilities and operations.  Each of thesecompliance initiatives could lead to internal and external costincreases. TheCompany may be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of itsgoodwill, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability. Goodwillrepresents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the fairvalue of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.  The Companytests goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstanceschange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unitbelow its carrying amount.  This may occur for various reasonsincluding changes in actual or expected income or cash flows of a reportingunit.  In the fourth quarter 2008, we recorded a pre-tax non-cashcharge of $785 million to write-off  15  asignificant portion of the goodwill balance within the GCGsegment.  We will continue to evaluate current market conditions thatmay affect the fair value of our reporting units to assess whether any furthergoodwill impairment exists in the future.  Continued adverse orworsening market conditions for certain businesses may have a significant impacton the fair value of the reporting units and could result in additional future impairments ofgoodwill"
11,KODK,EASTMAN KODAK CO,2007-03-01,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual future results of the Company to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this document and other public statements the Company makes. Additionally, because of the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, the Companys past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance.PAGE 13If we do not effectively execute our digital transformation, this could adversely affect our operations, revenue and ability to compete.  The Company continues with its transformation from a traditional products and services company to a primarily digital products and services company. This transformation includes an aggressive restructuring program to reduce its traditional infrastructure to cost-effectively manage the declining traditional business and to reduce its general and administrative costs to the level necessary to compete profitably in the digital markets. The Company expects these actions to be largely completed by the end of 2007. As a result of the digital transformation, the Company has established three key financial metrics against which it will measure success: net cash generation, earnings growth from digital products and services, and revenue growth from digital products and services. Accordingly, the success of the Companys transformation is dependent upon the execution of the Companys transformation initiatives including (1) managing the amount and timing of thecost savings resulting from the restructuring of its traditional infrastructure and the reductions in general and administrative costs, (2) Kodaks ability to continue its development and sale of digital products and services that deliver competitive margins in each of its segments, (3) the Companys ability to manage the traditional business for cash generation in a cost-effective manner and (4) the Companys ability to continue to successfully integrate its acquisitions, including KPG and Creo. If Kodak cannot continue to successfully execute its transformation initiatives, the Companys ability to compete as a profitable and growing digital company could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to generate cash.If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our Secured Credit Agreement, including the two financial covenants, our ability to meet our financial obligations could be severely impaired.There are affirmative, negative and financial covenants contained in the Companys Secured Credit Agreement. These covenants are typical for a secured credit agreement of this nature. The Companys failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Secured Credit Agreement. If an event of default were to occur and is not waived by the lenders, then all outstanding debt, interest and other payments under the Secured Credit Agreement could become immediately due and payable and any unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility of the Secured Credit Agreement could be terminated by the lenders. The failure of the Company to repay any accelerated debt under the Secured Credit Agreement could result in acceleration of the majority of the Companys unsecured outstanding debt obligations.If we cannot effectively manage transitions of our products and services, this could adversely affect our revenues.The industries in which Kodak competes are rapidly changing and becoming increasingly more complex. Kodaks ability to successfully transition its existing products to new offerings requires that the Company make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes, product mix, customer demand, sales channels, and configuration. The process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products by competitors that offer improved performance and pricing. Kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the products realizable customer demand and revenue stream. Further, in the face of intense industry competition, any unanticipated delay in implementing certain product strategies (including digital products, category expansion and digitization) or in the development, production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantageKodak may have to be the first or among the first to market and could adversely affect Kodaks revenues. Kodaks failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand, or at all, could adversely affect future demand for the Companys products and services and have an adverse effect on its business. This risk is exacerbated when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before Kodaks introduction of a similar product.Our results are subject to risks related to our significant investment in developing and introducing new products, such as consumer inkjet printers and CMOS semiconductors. These risk include: difficulties and delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of products; customer acceptance of products; resources we must devote to the development of new technology; and the ability to differentiate our products and compete with other companies in the same markets.PAGE 14If we cannot effectively anticipate trends and respond to changing customer preferences, this could aversely affect our revenues.Due to changes in technology, the market for traditional photography products and services is in decline and, as a result, product development has focused on digital capture devices (digital cameras and scanners) designed to improve the image acquisition or digitalization process, software products designed to enhance and simplify the digital workflow, output devices (thermal and inkjet printers and commercial printing systems and solutions) designed to produce high quality documents and images, and media (thermal and silver halide) optimized for digital workflows. Kodaks success depends in part on its ability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner that keep pace with technological developments and that are accepted in the market. The Company continues to introduce new consumer and commercial digital product offerings, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in anticipating and developing newproducts, product enhancements or new solutions and services to adequately address changing technologies and customer requirements. In addition, if the Company is unable to anticipate and develop improvements to its current technology, to adapt its products to changing customer preferences or requirements or to continue to produce high quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner in order to compete with products offered by its competitors, this could adversely affect the revenues of the Company.If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, our business could be harmed.Kodak has made substantial investments in technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights as well as the interests of the Company licensees. The execution and enforcement of licensing agreements protects the Companys intellectual property rights and provides a revenue stream in the form of royalties that enables Kodak to further innovate and provide the marketplace with new products and services. There is no assurance that such measures alone will be adequate to protect the Companys intellectual property.Our revenue and earnings may suffer if we cannot continue to implement our intellectual property licensing strategies.The Companys ability to execute its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the Companys revenue and earnings. Kodaks failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect market positions and business opportunities. Furthermore, the Companys failure to identify and implement licensing programs, including identifying appropriate licensees, could adversely affect the profitability of Kodaks operations.Our revenue, earnings and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights.Kodak relies upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce its intellectual property rights. Any of the Companys direct or indirect intellectual property rights could, however, be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit the Company to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying oruse, which could adversely affect its competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.PAGE 15Our revenue, earnings and expenses may suffer if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.Third parties may claim that the Company or customers indemnified by Kodak are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. In recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like the Company. Even if Kodak believes that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and distract managements attention and resources. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require the Company to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting Kodak from marketing or selling certain of its products. Even if the Company has an agreement to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreement to Kodak.If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could suffer.If we are not successful in transitioning certain financial processes and administrative functions to a global shared services model and outsourcing some of the work to third parties, our business performance, cost savings and cash flow could be adversely impacted.The Company continues to migrate various administrative and financial processes, such as general accounting, accounts payable, credit and collections, call centers and human resources processes to a global shared services model to more effectively manage its costs. Delays in the migration to the global shared services model and to third party vendors could adversely impact the Companys ability to meet its cost reduction goals. Also, if third party vendors do not perform to Kodaks standards, such as a delay in collection of customer receipts, the Companys cash flow could be negatively impacted.Our inability to develop and implement e-commerce strategies that align with industry standards, could adversely affect our business.In the event Kodak were unable to develop and implement e-commerce strategies that are in alignment with consumer trends, the Companys business could be adversely affected. The availability of software and standards related to e-commerce strategies is of an emerging nature. Kodaks ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions requires the Company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services.System integration issues could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.Portions of our IT infrastructure may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or product errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time; in particular, installation of SAP within our Graphic Communications Group. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruption could adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, higher costs or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Our inability to effectively manage our acquisitions could adversely impact our revenues and earnings.In 2005, Kodak completed two large business acquisitions in its Graphic Communications Group segment in order to strengthen and diversify its portfolio of businesses, while establishing itself as a leader in the graphic communications market. The Company is accelerating the current restructuring of its traditional manufacturing infrastructure. In the event that Kodak fails to effectively manage the continuing decline of its more traditional businesses while simultaneously integrating these acquisitions, it could fail to obtain the expected synergies and favorable impact of these acquisitions. Such a failure could cause Kodak to lose market opportunities and experience a resulting adverse impact on its revenues and earnings.PAGE 16Our inability to complete divestitures and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our financial position.In January 2007, Kodak announced that it has reached an agreement to sell the Health Group to Onex Corporation. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2007. In the event that the Company is unable to complete the divestiture of the Health Group, it could fail to realize the favorable impacts to the Company created through the reduction of debt and other uses. Such a failure could cause Kodak to experience an adverse impact on its financial position.Economic trends in our major markets could adversely affect net sales.Economic downturns and declines in consumption in Kodaks major markets may affect the levels of both commercial and consumer sales. Purchases of Kodaks consumer products are to a significant extent discretionary. Accordingly, weakening economic conditions or outlook could result in a decline in the level of consumption and could adversely affect Kodaks results of operations.If we do not timely implement our planned inventory reductions, this could adversely affect our cash flow.Unanticipated delays in the Companys plans to continue inventory reductions in 2007 could adversely impact Kodaks cash flow outlook. Planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales due to the competitive environment for digital products, and the continuing decline in demand for traditional products, which could also place pressures on Kodaks sales and market share. In the event Kodak is unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner, they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions.Delays in our plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control cost of operations could negatively impact our gross margins.Kodaks failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity. Delays in Kodaks plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control costs of operations, including its ongoing restructuring actions to significantly reduce its traditional manufacturing infrastructure, could negatively impact the gross margins of the Company. Furthermore, if Kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers, or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity-based raw materials, reduction in the gross margins could occur.We depend on third party suppliers and, therefore, our revenue and gross margins could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly.Kodaks operations depend on its ability to anticipate the needs for components, products and services and Kodaks suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices in time for Kodak to meet its schedules. Given the wide variety of products, services and systems that Kodak offers, the large number of suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm Kodak. Other supplier problems that Kodak could face include component shortages, excess supply and risks related to terms of its contracts with suppliers.PAGE 17We have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third party manufacturers and external suppliers.We have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. To the extent that we rely on third party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. If any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships withour customers, and reduce our market share, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.If our planned improvements in supply chain efficiency are delayed, this could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.As the Company continues with its transformation from a traditional products and services company to a digital products and services company, Kodaks planned improvement in supply chain efficiency, if delayed, could adversely affect its business by preventing shipments of certain products to be made in their desired quantities and in a timely and cost-effective manner. The planned efficiencies could be compromised if Kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated. Any unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could also compromise our supply chain efficiencies.The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and market share.The markets in which we do business are highly competitive, and we encounter aggressive price competition for all our products and services from numerous companies globally. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for film and digital cameras and related products and services has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered their profit margins for these products. In the Health Group and Graphic Communications Group segments, aggressive pricing tactics have intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors vie for customers and market share. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If the Company is unable to obtain pricing or programs sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, Kodak could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins.If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and earnings.We may provide financing and financial guarantees to our customers, some of which may be for significant amounts.The competitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide customer financing to a customer in order to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as well as working capital. In some circumstances, these loans can be significant. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources and may also provide financial guarantees on behalf of our customers. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers creditworthiness. If we are unable to provide competitive financing arrangements to our customers or if we extend credit to customers that are not creditworthy, this could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial position.PAGE 18Economic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.Kodak conducts business in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of doing business in developing markets such as China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Russia and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect Kodaks operations and earnings. Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability and potential conflicts among developing nations and other non-economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments. Kodaks failure to successfully manage economic, political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business.Because we sell our products and services worldwide, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates that may adversely impact our operations and financial position.Kodak, as a result of its global operating and financing activities, is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which the Company does business tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe. There can be no guarantees that the economic situation in developing markets or elsewhere will not worsen, which could result in future effects on earnings should such events occur.Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. If we discover a material weakness in the future, we may not be able to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. As a result, our business, brand and operating results could be harmed.Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports. If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports, its business, brand and operating results could be harmed. As disclosed in the Companys 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of 2006, managements assessment of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting identified a material weakness in the Companys internal controls related to the completeness and accuracy of the Companys deferred income tax valuation allowance account. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company has made significant progress in executing the remediation plans that were established to address the material weakness identified above. This resulted in material improvements in theCompanys internal control over financial reporting, including the successful remediation of the material weakness in internal controls related to the completeness and accuracy of the Companys deferred income tax valuation allowance account as of December 31, 2006. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.If we cannot protect our reputation due to product quality and liability issues, our business could be harmed.Kodak products are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complicated to design and build as rapid advancements in technologies occur. Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality and liability issues, there can be no assurance that Kodak will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated damages. Kodak may incur expenses in connection with, for example, product recalls, service and lawsuits, and Kodaks brand image and reputation as a producer of high-quality products could suffer"
10,KODK,EASTMAN KODAK CO,2006-03-02,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual future results of the Company to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this document and other public statements the Company makes.  Additionally, because of the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, the Companys past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance.If we do not effectively execute our digital transformation, this could adversely affect our operations, revenue and ability to compete. The Company continues with its transformation from a traditional products and services company to a digital products and services company.  This transformation includes an aggressive restructuring program to reduce its traditional infrastructure to cost-effectively manage the declining traditional business and to reduce its general and administrative costs to the level necessary to compete profitably in the digital markets.  The Company expects these actions to be largely completed by mid 2007.  As a result of the digital transformation, the Company has established three key financial metrics against which it will measure success: digital earnings growth through expanding margins from the Companys digital businesses, digital revenue growth and cash generation.  Accordingly, the success of the Companys transformation is dependent upon the execution of the Companys transformation initiatives including (1) managing the amount andtiming of the cost savings resulting from the restructuring of its traditional infrastructure and the reductions in general and administrative costs, (2) Kodaks ability to continue its development and sale of digital products and services that deliver competitive margins in each of its segments, (3) the Companys ability to manage the traditional business for cash generation in a cost-effective manner and (4) Kodaks ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions, including KPG and Creo.  If Kodak cannot successfully execute its transformation initiatives, the Companys ability to compete as a profitable and growing digital company could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to generate cash.  If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our Secured Credit Agreement, including the two financial covenants, our ability to meet our financial obligations could be severely impaired.There are affirmative, negative and financial covenants contained in the Companys Secured Credit Agreement.  These covenants are typical for a secured credit agreement of this nature.  The Companys failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Secured Credit Agreement.  If an event of default were to occur and is not waived by the lenders, then all outstanding debt, interest and other payments under the Secured Credit Agreement could become immediately due and payable and any unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility of the Secured Credit Agreement could be terminated by the lenders.  The failure of the Company to repay any accelerated debt under the Secured Credit Agreement could result in acceleration of the majority of the Companys unsecured outstanding debt obligations.If we cannot effectively manage transitions of our products and services, this could adversely affect our revenues. The industries in which Kodak competes are rapidly changing and becoming increasingly more complex.  Kodaks ability to successfully transition its existing products to new offerings requires that Kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes, product mix, customer demand, sales channels, and configuration.  The process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products that offer improved performance and pricing.  Kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the products realizable customer demand and revenue stream.  Further, in the face of intense industry competition, any unanticipated delay in implementing certain product strategies (including digital products, category expansion and digitization) or in the development, production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantageKodak may have to be the first or among the first to market and could adversely affect Kodaks revenues.  Kodaks failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand, or at all, could adversely affect future demand for Kodaks products and services and have an adverse effect on its business.  This risk is exacerbated when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before Kodaks introduction of a similar product. PAGE 13If we cannot effectively anticipate trends and respond to changing customer preferences, this could aversely affect our revenues.Due to changes in technology, the market for traditional photography products and services is in decline and, as a result, product development has focused on digital capture devices (digital cameras and scanners) designed to improve the image acquisition or digitalization process, software products designed to enhance and simplify the digital workflow, output devices (thermal printers, digital silver halide writers and commercial printing systems and solutions) designed to produce high quality images, and media (thermal and silver halide) optimized for digital workflows.  Kodaks success depends in part on its ability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner that keep pace with technological developments and that are accepted in the market. The Company continues to introduce new consumer and commercial digital product offerings, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in anticipating anddeveloping new products, product enhancements or new solutions and services to adequately address changing technologies and customer requirements.  In addition, if the Company is unable to anticipate and develop improvements to its current technology, to adapt its products to changing customer preferences or requirements or to continue to produce high quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner in order to compete with products offered by its competitors, this could adversely affect the revenues of the Company.If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, our business could be harmed.Kodak has made substantial investments intechnologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protectits intellectual property rights as well as the interests of Kodaklicensees.  The execution and enforcement of licensing agreements protectsthe Companys intellectual property rights and provides a revenue stream inthe form of royalties that enables Kodak to further innovate and provide themarketplace with new products and services.  There is no assurance thatsuch measures will be adequate to protect the Companys intellectualproperty.Our revenue, earnings and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to implement our intellectual property licensing strategies.Kodaks ability to execute its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the Companys revenue and earnings.  Kodaks failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect market positions and business opportunities.  Furthermore, Kodaks failure to manage the costs associated with intellectual property generation, licensing and litigation could adversely affect the profitability of Kodaks operations.Our revenue, earnings and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights.Kodak relies upon patent, copyright,trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in othercountries, and agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers and otherparties, to establish, maintain and enforce its intellectual propertyrights.  Any of Kodaks direct or indirect intellectual propertyrights could, however, be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or suchintellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit the Company to takeadvantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitiveadvantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts,discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to thesame extent as the laws of the United States.  Therefore, in certainjurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technologyadequately against unauthorized third party copying or use, which couldadversely affect its competitive position.  Also, because of the rapid paceof technological change in the information technology industry, much of ourbusiness and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensedby third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtainlicenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonableterms, or such parties may demand cross-licenses.PAGE 14Our revenue, earnings and expenses may suffer if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.Third parties may claim that Kodak or customers indemnified by Kodak are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.  In recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak.  Even if Kodak believes that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and distract managements attention and resources.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require Kodak to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting Kodak from marketing or selling certain of its products.  Even if Kodak has an agreement to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreement toKodak.  If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could suffer.  If we are not successful in transitioning certain financial processes and administrative functions to a global shared services model and outsourcing some of their work to third parties, our business performance, cost savings and cash flow could be adversely impacted.The Company continues to migrate various administrative and financial processes, such as general accounting, accounts payable, credit and collections, call centers and human resources processes to a global shared services model to more effectively manage its costs.  Delays in the migration to the global shared services model and to third party vendors could adversely impact the Companys ability to meet its cost reduction goals.  Also, if third party vendors do not perform to Kodaks standards, such as a delay in collection of customer receipts, the Companys cash flow could be negatively impacted.Our inability to develop and implement e-commerce strategies that align with industry standards, could adversely affect our business. In the event Kodak were unable to develop and implement e-commerce strategies that are in alignment with the trend toward industry standards and services, the Companys business could be adversely affected.  The availability of software and standards related to e-commerce strategies is of an emerging nature.  Kodaks ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions requires the Company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services.System integration issues could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Kodaks completion of planned information systems upgrades, including SAP, if delayed, could adversely affect its business.  As Kodak continues to expand the planned information services, the Company must continue to balance the investment of the planned deployment with the need to upgrade the vendor software.  Kodaks failure to successfully upgrade to the vendor-supported version could result in risks to system availability, which could adversely affect the business.Our inability to effectively manage our acquisitions, divestitures and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our revenues and earnings. Kodak has recently completed two large business acquisitions in its Graphic Communications Group segment in order to strengthen and diversify its portfolio of businesses, while establishing itself as a leader in the graphic communications market.  At the same time, Kodak is accelerating the current restructuring of its traditional manufacturing infrastructure.  In the event that Kodak fails to effectively manage the continuing decline of its more traditional businesses while simultaneously integrating these acquisitions, it could fail to obtain the expected synergies and favorable impact of these acquisitions.  Such a failure could cause Kodak to lose market opportunities and experience a resulting adverse impact on its revenues and earnings.PAGE 15Economic trends in our major markets could adversely affect net sales.Economic downturns and declines in consumption in Kodaks major markets may affect the levels of both commercial and consumer sales. Purchases of Kodaks consumer products are to a significant extent discretionary.  Accordingly, weakening economic conditions or outlook could result in a decline in the level of consumption and could adversely affect Kodaks results of operations. If we do not timely implement our planned inventory reductions, this could adversely affect our cash flow. Unanticipated delays in the Companys plans to continue inventory reductions in 2006 could adversely impact Kodaks cash flow outlook. Planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales due to the competitive environment for digital products, and the continuing decline in demand for traditional products, which could also place pressures on Kodaks sales and market share.  In the event Kodak is unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner, they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions. Delays in our plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control cost of operations could negatively impact our gross margins. Kodaks failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity.  Delays in Kodaks plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control costs of operations, including its ongoing restructuring actions to significantly reduce its traditional manufacturing infrastructure, could negatively impact the gross margins of the Company.  Furthermore, if Kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers, or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity-based raw materials, reduction in the gross margins could occur.  We depend on third party suppliers and, therefore, our revenue and gross margins could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly.Kodaks operations depend on its ability to anticipate the needs for components, products and services and Kodaks suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices in time for Kodak to meet its schedules.  Given the wide variety of products, services and systems that Kodak offers, the large number of suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm Kodak.  Other supplier problems that Kodak could face include component shortages, excess supply and risks related to terms of its contracts with suppliers.If our planned improvements in supply chain efficiency are delayed, this could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. As the Company continues with its transformation from a traditional products and services company to a digital products and services company, Kodaks planned improvement in supply chain efficiency, if delayed, could adversely affect its business by preventing shipments of certain products to be made in their desired quantities and in a timely and cost-effective manner.  The planned efficiencies could be compromised if Kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated.  Any unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could also compromise the supply chain efficiencies.PAGE 16The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and market share. Competition remains intense across all segments in which Kodak competes.  In the D&FIS segment (which has been realigned into the Consumer Digital Imaging Group and the Film and Photofinishing Systems Group effective January 1, 2006), price competition has been driven somewhat by consumers conservative spending behaviors during times of a weak world economy, international tensions and the accompanying concern over war and terrorism.  In the Health Group and Graphic Communications Group segments, aggressive pricing tactics intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors were vying for customers and market share domestically.  If the Company is unable to obtain pricing or programs sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, Kodak may lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins.If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted. The impact of continuing customer consolidation and buying power could have an adverse impact on Kodaks revenue, gross margins, and earnings.  In the competitive consumer retail environment, there is a movement from small individually owned retailers to larger and commonly known mass merchants.  In the health market, there is a continuing consolidation of various group purchasing organizations.  In the commercial graphic communications market, the Companys products are sold primarily through a variety of direct and indirect channels.  These resellers and distributors may elect to use suppliers other than Kodak.  Kodaks challenge is to successfully negotiate contracts that provide the most favorable conditions to the Company in the face of price and aggressive competitors.Economic uncertainty in developingmarkets could adversely affect our revenue and earnings. Kodak conducts business in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe.  The risk of doing business in developing markets like China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Russia and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect Kodaks operations and earnings.  Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability and potential conflicts among developing nations and other non-economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments.  Kodaks failure to successfully manage economic, political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business.Because we sell our products and services worldwide, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates that may adversely impact our operations and financial position. Kodak, as a result of its global operating and financing activities, is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  Exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which the Company does business tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe.  There can be no guarantees that the economic situation in developing markets or elsewhere will not worsen, which could result in future effects on earnings should such events occur.Management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 due to a material weakness in internal controls surrounding our accounting for income taxes.  If we fail to remediate this material weakness or any material weaknesses we may discover in the future, we may not be able to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. As a result, our business, brand and operating results could be harmed. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports.  If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports, its business, brand and operating results could be harmed.  As disclosed in the Companys 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of 2005, managements assessment of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting identified material weaknesses in the Companys internal controls surrounding the accounting for income taxes and in its internalPAGE 17controls surrounding the accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  In addition, in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005, the Company also reported a material weakness in its internal controls surrounding the preparation and review of spreadsheets that include new or changed formulas.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company has made significant progress in executing the remediation plans that were established to address the material weaknesses identified above.  This resulted in material improvements in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, including the successful remediation of the material weaknesses in internal controls surrounding its accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits and spreadsheet controls as of December 31, 2005.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detectmisstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot protect our reputation due to product quality and liability issues, our business could be harmed.Kodak products are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complicated to design and build as rapid advancements in technologies occur.  Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality and liability issues, there can be no assurance that Kodak will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated damages.  Kodak may incur expenses in connection with, for example, product recalls, service and lawsuits, and Kodaks brand image and reputation as a producer of high-quality products could suffer.
