2,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2023-11-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could, in turn, adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.Risks associated with operating a global businessThe risks of doing business internationally apply to all aspects of our operations.We derive significant revenues from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, including third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and semiconductor foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate our own wafer processing facilities in Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Singapore and in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating in multiple jurisdictions. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•    recession or economic downturn globally or in the jurisdictions in which we do business,•    currency controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•    inflation or deflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation or deflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,•    interest rates, as well as changes in existing and expected interest rates, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,•    global, regional, and local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, political, and supply chain instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships among the United States, China, Taiwan, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Israel, other Middle Eastern countries, Japan, Singapore, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, as well as related to armed conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in Israel and other Middle Eastern countries, that exist, or in the future could exist, in various jurisdictions around the world,•    restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, restrictions on individuals’ movement, including travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, and curfews, trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, export licenses, and tariffs, and restrictions on the purchase of products made or containing technology or components from certain companies or from companies located in certain jurisdictions), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, boycotts, insurgencies, organized crime, and general civil unrest), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•    labor market conditions and laws,•    disruptions of capital and trading markets,•    difficulty in collecting, or failure to collect, accounts receivable, as well as longer collection periods,•    changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•    natural disasters and severe weather events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, as well as other impacts of climate change,•    acts of terrorism, widespread illness or other deterioration of public health conditions, and war,•    misappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies or enforcement mechanisms in certain jurisdictions,•    difficulty in engaging distribution partners or obtaining sales or other business support in certain jurisdictions,•    cultural differences in the conduct of business,•    direct or indirect government actions, subsidies, or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•    the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements, including, but not limited to, prohibitions on certain trade and other activities in China, Russia, Belarus, and portions of Ukraine,•    withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•    changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments,•    changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,12•    results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, and•    limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business have established, or may establish, legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. It is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant resources to comply with the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, intellectual property matters, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, competition, data privacy and protection, employment, and labor relations. Violations of one or more of these legal regimes’ laws and regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, penalties, or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our counterparties that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are subject to the risks of doing business in China.Demand from Chinese customers may be adversely affected by China’s evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, information security, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, economic environment, governmental policies, United States-China relations, or China-Taiwan relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China, or deemed to be of Chinese origin, and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs, the availability and cost of materials, including gallium, germanium, and rare earth minerals, and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions, and might continue expanding export restrictions, by adding certain Chinese entities to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List (the “Entity List”), which has limited, and could in the future limit, our ability to sell to certain of those entities and to third parties that do business with those entities. These restrictions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, sales of our products. In the future, we may be prevented from shipping, or be required to obtain a license to ship, our products to certain customers if they are added to the Entity List. In addition, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt the operations of several companies in Taiwan that are suppliers to, or third-party partners of, the Company, our customers, and our customers’ other suppliers. Disruption of certain critical operations in Taiwan would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and would likely have substantial negative effects on the entire semiconductor industry. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, China’s investments in technology development and manufacturing capability in support of its stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies has likely already resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities change, our tax liability could increase. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, for U.S. income tax purposes we were required to capitalize our research and development expenses and amortize them over five or fifteen years, rather than deduct them in the year incurred, which has increased, and which we expect will continue to increase, our taxes payable, resulting in reduced near term-cash flows. Furthermore, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which imposes a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income for certain corporations, as well as an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. We are currently evaluating the impact this law may have on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024.13Because the changes in U.S. tax law require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued under these laws, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to changes to federal tax law. Future changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to initiatives related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; the European Commission’s “state aid” investigations; enactment of a global corporate minimum tax; and other developments could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses, including our own. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, evaluate their tax policies and rules on a regular basis, and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. We are unable to predict what tax changes may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes could affect our effective tax rates in countries where we have operations and could have an adverse effect on our overall tax position in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.The global COVID-19 pandemic—including the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus and its variants, and the resulting global supply chain challenges—has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations. The pandemic’s impacts on our business operations and workforce, and the duration of such impacts, are uncertain, constantly evolving, and difficult to quantify, but have thus far included, or in the future may include, disruptions to our supply chain and increased costs in connection with the sourcing of materials, components, equipment, assembly and test services, engineering support, shipping and logistics services, and other services. Our business operations would also be negatively impacted if one or more of our major customers were to significantly decrease its orders for our products due to disruptions to its business operations or other pandemic-related issues.The degree to which the pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the existence of new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business operations, results of operations and financial condition as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy.Risks associated with the development, manufacturing, and sale of our productsOur operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations, market downturns, and recessions.Our revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•    delays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5G networks and other new technologies,•    changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•    the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•    production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•    availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•    the gain or loss of significant customers,•    our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•    market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products including, but not limited to, market acceptance of new, emerging technologies,•    new product and technology introductions by competitors,•    delays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment or consumer adoption of certain technologies, •    actions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,•    changes in consumers’ purchasing behaviors, including the rates at which they replace smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,•    changes to promotions, rebates, and discounts offered by carriers in certain geographic regions for smartphones and other devices that utilize our products, •    increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•    changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and14•    intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products).We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, and such projections may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.We rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our stock price. In each of fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 14 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We rely on Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) to design our products into their end products.Our products are not sold directly to the end user but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex, specialized, and subject to disruption.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages or fluctuations, water shortages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate business continuity risks, among other risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and 15BAW filter wafer processing facilities in Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•    the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,•    required minimum purchase commitments,•    limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•    limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, process technologies, and quality assurance, and•    the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.Even in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, be unwilling to invest in processes that meet our needs, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters or to severe weather events and other impacts of climate change. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties, delays, or additional costs in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, as part of our supply resilience and business continuity strategies, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays and/or increased costs in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.During fiscal 2022, we entered into long-term capacity reservation and supply agreements with certain third-party foundries, under which we agreed to certain minimum purchase commitments. As a result of reduced overall market demand, we recorded impairment charges during fiscal 2023. These long-term capacity reservation agreements may have an additional adverse effect on our operating results in the event our future supply needs are reduced below the minimum purchase commitments as a result of further reduction in overall market demand. 16We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, gallium, germanium, and precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules; we may lose a significant or sole supplier; a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications; shipments of precious metals may be subject to theft; and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or materials at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, if we lost a supplier, or if a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected because the time required to identify and qualify an alternative supply source, where available, is typically lengthy. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply constraints for certain materials and components, which has impacted, and could continue to impact, production lead times, the cost of such materials and components, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers and in the future could become dependent on additional sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated. Furthermore, our entry into capacity commitments in an attempt to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and components may result in our obligation to pay above-market prices in the event of a future downward price correction.We may not be able to effectively operate our business if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key engineering and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management, engineering, and technical personnel. The competition for management, engineering, and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the locations in which we operate, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are in high demand, and our competitors and other companies may be able to offer compensation opportunities in excess of what we offer. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given, among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. If we are unable to obtain required stockholder approval for future increases in the number of shares available under our long-term incentive plans, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentive awards, which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities (in the United States or abroad), limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas, and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, and service our international customer base. The increased ability of employees in our industry to work from home or in other remote work arrangements has impacted, and may continue to impact, the mobility and turnover of our employees, potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in the job market. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business could be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. In addition, the loss of certain members of our senior management team could harm our relationships with key customers, which could negatively impact our future revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products.17Our sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may seek to cancel or defer orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict and may not be accurate. The difficulties of forecasting may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Many of our products are customized to the needs or specifications of a specific customer or have a limited number of potential buyers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. On the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice, which could result in damaged customer relationships, increased manufacturing costs, increased liabilities, or harm to our reputation if we are unable to meet such increases in demand.In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired. Furthermore, our dependence on third-party carriers and logistics firms, many of which have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in, and could continue to result in, delays, increased costs, and expedite fees related to our product shipments.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities (including, but not limited to, capital expenditures), we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the future growth of our business is likely to require the expansion of our manufacturing facilities, the upgrade of our manufacturing equipment, strategic investments, and/or corporate acquisitions. Due in part to our repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness, the capital required to fund these investments may not be available in the future.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Labs, which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business.On May 21, 2021, the Company, as borrower, entered into a term credit agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $1.0 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). Additionally, on May 26, 2021, the Company issued $500 million of its 0.900% 2023 Notes, $500 million of its 1.800% 2026 Notes, and $500 million of its 3.000% 2031 Notes in a public offering (the “Notes”). The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of Notes were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Company’s acquisition of certain assets, rights, and properties, and its assumption of certain liabilities, comprising Silicon Labs’ Infrastructure and Automotive business, on July 26, 2021 (the “Acquisition”). Since May 2021, the Company has repaid certain amounts of indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and the Notes, including as discussed in Note 16 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Additionally, on May 21, 2021, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $750 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility could be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries. Indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility, or the Notes could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. We also have incurred, and will continue to incur, various costs and expenses associated with our indebtedness. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We are exposed to interest rate risk through our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, both of which are subject to variable interest rates, and interest rate increases have led to increased interest payments. Our existing indebtedness or incurrence of any additional indebtedness could reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. 18In addition, our credit ratings, combined with fluctuating interest rates, affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. An inability to obtain or maintain a rating could increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings of our indebtedness, limit our access to sources of financing in the future, or lead to other potentially adverse consequences.The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The agreements that govern the Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and the Revolving Credit Facility contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, change the nature of our business, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain assets to any one person. In addition, some of the agreements contain a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Any such acceleration of our repayment obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or stock price. To be successful we may need to make additional investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement or expand our product offerings, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•    recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Risks associated with our industryThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could adversely affect our stock price.The wireless communications, analog and mixed-signal semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and rapid loss of market share. We compete with 19international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies, and/or state-sponsored investments, intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•    rapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps),•    timely new product innovation,•    ability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G,•    product quality, reliability, and performance,•    ability of certain products, including “high reliability” solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions,•    product cost and selling price,•    features available in products,•    alignment with customer performance specifications,•    compliance with industry standards,•    strategic relationships with customers,•    access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property,•    ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, •    maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost, and•    the ability to secure government incentives and grants, such as funding available to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•    long presence in key markets,•    brand recognition,•    high levels of customer satisfaction,•    vertical integration,•    strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•    a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,•    ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and•    strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partner’s baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, causing such competitors to rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to constantly innovate.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced 20products on a timely basis, both within our traditional markets and in new, expanded, or adjacent markets. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•    to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•    to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity within an international supply chain to meet customer demand,•    to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•    to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•    to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•    to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•    to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, •    to source and maintain manufacturing materials, •    to identify and maintain suppliers with the necessary technology and scale to support the increasing complexity of our manufacturing requirements, and•    to obtain adequate multi-jurisdictional intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth and technologies. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications, analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance, or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products in a timely manner and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries and form factors. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. We have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries and packaging subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our manufacturing partners may not be able to effectively manage the transition, or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain manufacturing partners. If our manufacturing partners or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, regulations, and customer expectations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.21A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, including a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and a number of such substances have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. In addition, our customers may begin to require reports on our sourcing of other minerals or substances, which may impact our ongoing operations and increase our operating costs.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.In addition, increasing governmental, investor, and societal attention on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics such as climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, human capital, forced labor, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We expect that these and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations, and expectations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, will continue to increase the cost of our compliance and internal risk management programs and to alter the environment in which we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our ESG practices and disclosures do not meet the expectations and standards of our stockholders, customers, and other industry stakeholders, our reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted and our appeal to certain investors may be reduced.Risks associated with cybersecurity and intellectual property protectionWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, information technology security breaches.Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, networks, and databases, and other cyberattacks continue to become more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers, networks, and products (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to prevent, detect, and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business, financial, and/or technical information, or the personal data of our employees and customers by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business and technology development. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’, or employees’ confidential or personal information, we may incur liability, face contractual and regulatory fines and penalties, and sustain significant financial resources to remediate such breach. Such an incident could, 22among other things, also damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, impact our stock price, and materially damage our supplier relationships. If a ransom-style cyberattack or similar incident impedes our ability to use or access our information systems for an extended period of time, this could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. In addition, certain suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity incidents, misappropriation efforts, or network disruptions that could jeopardize our proprietary or sensitive data, impact such third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us, or otherwise negatively impact our ongoing business operations. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in Israel and other Middle Eastern countries and the tensions involving China and Taiwan, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and databases, including through the training of our employees and monitoring the security posture of critical third parties who have access to our systems or sensitive data. However, we cannot ensure that these security measures and monitoring efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our systems may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, theft, system malfunctions, or other adverse events. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity and privacy laws that require companies’ overall information disclosure, processing practices, and technology security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous, and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws, to the extent applicable, may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, certain of our products contain firmware that incorporates or is derived from “open source” software that generally is made publicly available by its developers or other third parties. Risks related to the use of open source software include, but are not limited to, the introduction of cybersecurity vulnerabilities into our products or development platforms, our compliance with applicable licensing terms, subjecting certain of our derivative works or software enhancements to public disclosure and/or unfavorable licensing conditions, potential restrictions on our ability to market the firmware associated with our products, and enhanced governmental or other third-party scrutiny of our products.In order to remain competitive, we must be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-usage and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity, enforceability, and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:•    the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful,•    any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented, and•    we may be contractually prohibited, or otherwise discouraged, by certain customers from pursuing certain remedies for third parties’ violations of our intellectual property.A third party could potentially copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology or could be rendered invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including current and former employees, consultants, customers, licensees, suppliers, vendors, and other third parties may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, misappropriate or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers or other third parties to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our manufacturing and other business operations being interrupted. While we make reasonable attempts to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation, we may be unable to anticipate, detect, or stop the methods used, or we may be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.23We are subject to the risks of licensing third-party intellectual property.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Many of our products currently use or incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties, and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology for our current or future products become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share, and our business could be adversely affected. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop or acquire substitute technology to deliver competitive products. These risks are heightened with respect to certain of our products that incorporate increasing amounts of embedded software and digital circuit content that is subject to third-party intellectual property rights.Risks associated with claims and litigationWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, liability claims, and risks of litigation.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, from time to time we become aware of alleged defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including “high reliability” solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our “high reliability” solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical markets. The potential liabilities associated with these and similar provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. In addition, because our customers typically integrate our products into other devices, and because we typically do not have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products, our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. Depending on the nature of any product defect claims, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. Investigating, analyzing, and/or remediating alleged product defects may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, product redesigns, or obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs. In addition, in the event we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligations, lawsuits may be threatened or filed against us by customers or other third parties. Furthermore, force majeure clauses in our contracts could limit our ability to pursue remedies for certain third-party disruptions and delays. From time to time, we are, and may become, involved in litigation. We are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others. Such actions could result in the imposition of various remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages, which if awarded could materially and adversely harm our business. From time to time, we are, and may become, the subject of inquiries, requests for information, or investigations by government and regulatory agencies regarding our business. Any such matters, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management, damage our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our business.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and manufacturing operations and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations to our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation or the assessment of these claims. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•    pay substantial damages,•    cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•    discontinue the use of infringing technology,•    expend significant resources to develop an alternate non-infringing technology, and24•    license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions. In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Risks associated with owning our common stockOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:•    uncertainty regarding the condition and prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•    the volatility of the financial markets,•    instability in global credit and financial markets,•    our performance and prospects, and the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•    our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•    our stock repurchase and dividend activities,•    the timing of our repayment of outstanding indebtedness,•    investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•    changes in the market valuations of other companies, including, but not limited to, those in our industry,•    changes in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,•    the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•    the exclusion or removal of our stock from market indices, such as the S&P 500 Index,•    domestic and international political conditions,•    the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,•    domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•    our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect in the future, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We pay, and intend to continue to pay, quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations made by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•    our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to research and development,•    our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•    our use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•    our repayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness,•    changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•    changes to our business model.25Our cash dividend payments and stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends or make stock repurchases in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make it more difficult to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•    the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•    a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•    a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•    a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•    a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, and•    a fair price provision, as well as a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.26"

RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.Risks associated with operating a global businessThe risks of doing business internationally apply to all aspects of our operations.We derive significant revenues from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, including third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and semiconductor foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate our own wafer fabrication facilities in Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Singapore and in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating in multiple jurisdictions. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•Recession or economic downturn globally or in the jurisdictions in which we do business,•currency controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,•interest rates, as well as changes in existing and expected interest rates, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,•global, regional, and local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, political, and supply chain instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships among the United States, China, Taiwan, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, as well as related to armed conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that exist, or in the future could exist, in various jurisdictions around the world,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, restrictions on individuals’ movement, including travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, and curfews, and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, and tariffs), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, boycotts, insurgencies, organized crime, and general civil unrest), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•labor market conditions and laws,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•difficulty in collecting, or failure to collect, accounts receivable, as well as longer collection periods,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters and severe weather events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, as well as other impacts of climate change,•acts of terrorism, widespread illness or other deterioration of public health conditions, and war,•misappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,•difficulty in engaging distribution partners or obtaining sales or other business support in certain jurisdictions,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies, or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements, including, but not limited to, prohibitions on certain trade and other activities in China, Russia, Belarus, and portions of Ukraine,•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments,•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, and11•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business have established, or may establish, legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. It is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant resources to comply with the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, competition, data privacy and protection, employment, and labor relations. Violations of one or more of these legal regimes’ laws and regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, penalties, or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.The effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely affect our business operations.The global COVID-19 pandemic—including the public health crisis, the measures taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in an effort to limit COVID-19’s spread, and the resulting global supply chain challenges—has adversely affected, and continues to adversely affect, our business operations. The impacts on our business operations and workforce of the pandemic, including as a result of more contagious variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and the duration of such impacts, are uncertain, constantly evolving, and difficult to quantify, but have thus far included, or in the future may include, the following:•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to our supply chain and increased costs in connection with the sourcing of materials, components, equipment, assembly and test services, engineering support, shipping and logistics services, and other services, caused in part by the pandemic. To the extent we are unable to pass these costs on to our customers, we experience reduced profitability. Given that our customers and suppliers are facing similar supply chain challenges, we expect continued difficulty in forecasting demand and supply needs for the foreseeable future. As a result of these uncertainties, we have increased, and may continue to increase, our inventory levels and purchase commitments.•We have recently experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, reduced demand for certain of our products as a result of certain customers’ difficulty obtaining materials, components, and services due to disruptions in such customers’ supply chains. While the government-mandated shutdowns in various regions of China during fiscal 2022 did not directly impact any of our manufacturing facilities, the shutdowns did result in limited supply constraints within our supply chain, as well as significant supply constraints for certain of our customers, which resulted in short-term reductions in such customers’ demand for our products. We may continue to experience large fluctuations in demand for certain of our products, which could be exacerbated by global supply chain challenges or by a continued or deepening global economic downturn or recession.•In the event that our manufacturing operations in Mexicali, Mexico, become subject to significant restrictions or are suspended again, as they were for two weeks in April 2020 pursuant to a government order, or in the event that one or more of our other facilities is forced to suspend or limit its activities, we may again experience reductions in production levels, which would limit our ability to meet customer demand and impact our operating results.•Over the course of the pandemic, we have implemented certain measures at our facilities worldwide in an effort to protect our employees’ health and well-being, some of which have reduced the overall efficiency of our operations and increased manufacturing costs. Many of our non-manufacturing employees transitioned to working from home on a mandatory or voluntarily basis for a prolonged period of time, and our return-to-office plans have in some cases led to employee attrition. We expect that pandemic-related changes in workforce patterns may result in additional attrition, difficulty in hiring, and reduced productivity. •We have experienced, and likely will continue to experience, disruptions to global transportation networks, limiting or delaying our ability, and/or increasing our cost, to send or receive products and materials at one or more of our facilities, including as a result of trade restrictions, border closures, disruptions in the operations of third-party carriers, or carriers’ decisions to prioritize other customers’ orders over ours.•Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. We may experience negative impacts to our business operations if one or more of these major customers were to significantly decrease its orders for our products due to disruptions to its business operations or other pandemic-related issues.12These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer and supplier relations, employee relations, cash flows, and financial condition. The resumption of normal business operations after any such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers.The degree to which the pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy.We are subject to the risks of doing business in China.Demand from Chinese customers may be adversely affected by China’s evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, information security, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, United States-China relations, or China-Taiwan relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China, or deemed to be of Chinese origin, and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs, the availability and cost of materials, and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions, and might continue expanding export restrictions, by adding certain Chinese entities to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List (the “Entity List”), which has, and could in the future, limit our ability to sell to certain of those entities and to third parties that do business with those entities. These restrictions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, sales of our products. In the future, we may be prevented from shipping, or be required to obtain a license to ship, our products to certain customers if they are added to the Entity List. In addition, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt the operations of several companies in Taiwan that are suppliers to, or third-party partners of, the Company, our customers, and our customers’ other suppliers. Disruption of certain critical operations in Taiwan would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and would likely have substantial negative effects on the entire semiconductor industry. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, China’s investments in technology development and manufacturing capability in support of its stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies has likely already resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), which significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operations. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, for U.S. income tax purposes we will be required to capitalize our research and development expenses and amortize them over five or fifteen years, rather than deduct them in the year incurred, which we expect will increase our taxes payable, resulting in reduced cash flows. Furthermore, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which imposes a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income for certain corporations, as well as an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Although we are currently evaluating the impact this law may have, we do expect our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal year 2024.Because the changes in U.S. tax law require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued under these laws, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to changes to tax law. Future changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to initiatives related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; the European Commission’s “state aid” investigations; enactment of a global corporate minimum tax; and other developments could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses, including our own. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to 13taxes, including the United States, evaluate their tax policies and rules on a regular basis, and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. We are unable to predict what tax changes may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes could affect our effective tax rates in countries where we have operations and could have an adverse effect on our overall tax position in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.Risks associated with the development, manufacturing, and sale of our productsOur operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations, market downturns, and recessions.Our revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•delays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5G networks,•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products (including, but not limited to, market acceptance of new, emerging technologies),•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•delays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment or consumer adoption of certain technologies, •actions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,•changes in consumers’ purchasing behaviors, including the rates at which they replace smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,•changes to promotions, rebates, and discounts offered by carriers in certain geographic regions for smartphones and other devices that utilize our products, •increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products).We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, and such projections may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.We rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our stock price. In each of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We rely on Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) to design our products into their end products.Our products are not sold directly to the end user but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, 14the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex, specialized, and subject to disruption.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, water shortages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate business continuity risks, among other risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filter wafer fabrication facilities in Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,•required minimum purchase commitments,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, process technologies, and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.15Even in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, be unwilling to invest in processes that meet our needs, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters or to severe weather events and other impacts of climate change. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties, delays, or additional costs in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, as part of our supply resilience and business continuity strategies we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays and/or increased costs in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.During fiscal 2022, we entered into long-term capacity reservation and supply agreements with certain third-party foundries. These agreements may cease to be commercially reasonable if overall market demand or pricing is reduced, and they may have an adverse effect on our operating results in the event our future supply needs are reduced below the minimum order commitments. Furthermore, even with such agreements, we remain subject to risks that a supplier will be unable to meet its supply commitments, achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, operate or deliver on a timely basis, or provide additional capacity beyond its current contractual commitments to meet our requirements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer obligations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules; we may lose a significant or sole supplier; a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications; shipments of precious metals may be subject to theft; and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or materials at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, if we lost a supplier, or if a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected because the time required to identify and qualify an alternative supply source, where available, is typically lengthy. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply constraints for certain materials and components, which has impacted, and could continue to impact, production lead times, the cost of such materials and components, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers and in the future could become dependent on additional sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated. Furthermore, our entry into capacity commitments in an attempt to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and components may result in our obligation to pay above-market prices in the event of a future downward price correction.We may not be able to effectively operate our business if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.16As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key engineering and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management, engineering, and technical personnel. The competition for management, engineering, and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the locations in which we operate, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies, which in some cases may be able to offer compensation opportunities in excess of what we offer. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given, among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. If we are unable to obtain required stockholder approval for future increases in the number of shares available under our long-term incentive plans, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentive awards, which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities (in the United States or abroad), limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas, and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, and service our international customer base. The increased ability of employees in our industry to work from home or in other remote work arrangements has impacted, and may continue to impact, the mobility and turnover of our employees, potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in the job market. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. In addition, the loss of certain members of our senior management team could harm our relationships with key customers, which could negatively impact our future revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products.Our sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may seek to cancel or defer orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict and may not be accurate. The difficulties of forecasting may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Many of our products are customized to the needs or specifications of a specific customer or have a limited number of potential buyers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. On the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice, which could result in damaged customer relationships, increased manufacturing costs, increased liabilities, or harm to our reputation if we are unable to meet such increases in demand. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment, or similar inventory programs that may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products. In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired. Furthermore, our dependence on third-party carriers and logistics firms, many of which have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in, and could continue to result in, delays, increased costs, and expedite fees related to our product shipments.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities (including, but not limited to, capital expenditures), we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us. 17In addition, the future growth of our business is likely to require the expansion of our manufacturing facilities, the upgrade of our manufacturing equipment, strategic investments, and/or corporate acquisitions. Due in part to our repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness, the capital required to fund these investments may not be available in the future.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Labs, which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business.On May 21, 2021, the Company, as borrower, entered into a term credit agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $1.0 billion Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on May 26, 2021, the Company issued $500 million of its 0.900% 2023 Notes, $500 million of its 1.800% 2026 Notes, and $500 million of its 3.000% 2031 Notes in a public offering. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of Notes were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Company’s acquisition of certain assets, rights, and properties, and its assumption of certain liabilities, comprising Silicon Labs’ Infrastructure and Automotive business, on July 26, 2021 (the “Acquisition”). Additionally, on May 21, 2021, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $750 million Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility could be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries. This indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. We also have incurred, and will continue to incur, various costs and expenses associated with our indebtedness. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We are exposed to interest rate risk through our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, both of which are subject to variable interest rates, and interest rate increases have led to increased interest payments. Our existing indebtedness or incurrence of any additional indebtedness could reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, our credit ratings, combined with fluctuating interest rates, affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. An inability to obtain or maintain a rating could increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings of our indebtedness, limit our access to sources of financing in the future, or lead to other potentially adverse consequences.The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The agreements that govern the Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and the Revolver contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, change the nature of our business, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain assets to any one person. In addition, some of the agreements contain a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Any such acceleration of our repayment obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or stock price. To be successful we may need to make additional investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,18•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Risks associated with our industryThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could adversely affect our stock price.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and rapid loss of market share. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies, and/or state-sponsored investments, intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps),•timely new product innovation,•ability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G,•product quality, reliability, and performance,•ability of certain products, including “high reliability” solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions,•product cost and selling price,•features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications,•compliance with industry standards,•strategic relationships with customers,•access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property,•ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, •maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost, and•the ability to secure government incentives and grants, such as funding available to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•long presence in key markets,•brand recognition,•high levels of customer satisfaction,•vertical integration,19•strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,•ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and•strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partner’s baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, causing such competitors to rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to constantly innovate.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis, both within our traditional markets and in new, expanded, or adjacent markets. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity within an international supply chain to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, •to source and maintain manufacturing materials, •to identify and maintain suppliers with the necessary technology and scale to support the increasing complexity of our manufacturing requirements, and•to obtain adequate multi-jurisdictional intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth and technologies. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance, or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products in a timely manner and thereby remain competitive.20In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries and form factors. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. We have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries and packaging subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our manufacturing partners may not be able to effectively manage the transition, or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain manufacturing partners. If our manufacturing partners or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, regulations, and customer expectations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. In addition, our customers may begin to require reports on our sourcing of other minerals or substances, which may impact our ongoing operations and increase our operating costs.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.21In addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics such as climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, human capital, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We expect that these and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations, and expectations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, will continue to increase the cost of our compliance and internal risk management programs and to alter the environment in which we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our ESG practices and disclosures do not meet the expectations and standards of our stockholders, customers, and other industry stakeholders, our reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted and our appeal to certain investors may be reduced.Risks associated with cybersecurity and intellectual property protectionWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, information technology security breaches.Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, networks, and databases, and other cyberattacks continue to become more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers, networks, and products (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to prevent, detect, and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business, financial, and/or technical information, or the personal data of our employees and customers by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business and technology development. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’, or employees’ confidential or personal information, we may incur liability, face contractual and regulatory fines and penalties, and sustain significant financial resources to remediate such breach. Such an incident could, among other things, also damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, impact our stock price, and materially damage our supplier relationships. If a ransom-style cyberattack or similar incident impedes our ability to use or access our information systems for an extended period of time, this could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. In addition, certain suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity incidents, misappropriation efforts, or network disruptions that could jeopardize our proprietary or sensitive data, impact such third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us, or otherwise negatively impact our ongoing business operations. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the tensions between China and Taiwan, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and databases, including through the training of our employees and monitoring the security posture of critical third parties who have access to our systems or sensitive data. However, we cannot ensure that these security measures and monitoring efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our systems may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, theft, system malfunctions, or other adverse events. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require companies’ overall information technology security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous, and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws, to the extent applicable, may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, certain of our products contain firmware that incorporates or is derived from “open source” software that generally is made publicly available by its developers or other third parties. Risks related to the use of open source software include, but are not limited to, the introduction of cybersecurity vulnerabilities into our products or development platforms, our compliance with applicable licensing terms, subjecting certain of our derivative works or software enhancements to public disclosure and/or unfavorable licensing conditions, potential restrictions on our ability to market the firmware associated with our products, and enhanced governmental or other third-party scrutiny of our products.In order to remain competitive, we must be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity, enforceability, and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:22•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful,•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented, and•we may be contractually prohibited, or otherwise discouraged, by certain customers from pursuing remedies for third parties’ violations of our intellectual property.A third party could potentially copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology or could be rendered invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including current and former employees, consultants, customers, licensees, suppliers, vendors, and other third-party affiliates may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, misappropriate or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our manufacturing and other business operations being interrupted. While we make reasonable attempts to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation, we may be unable to anticipate, detect, or stop the methods used, or we may be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.We are subject to the risks of licensing third-party intellectual property.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Many of our products currently use or incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology for our current or future products become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share, and our business could be adversely affected. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop or acquire substitute technology to deliver competitive products. These risks are heightened with respect to certain of our products that incorporate increasing amounts of digital circuit content that is subject to third-party intellectual property rights.Risks associated with claims and litigationWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, liability claims, and risks of litigation.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, from time to time we become aware of alleged defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including “high reliability” solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our “high reliability” solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical markets. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. In addition, because our customers typically integrate our products into other devices, and because we typically do not have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products, our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. Depending on the nature of any product defect claims, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. Investigating, analyzing, and/or remediating alleged product defects may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, product redesigns, or obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs. In addition, in the event we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligations, lawsuits may be threatened or filed against us by customers or other third parties. Furthermore, force majeure clauses in our contracts could limit our ability to pursue remedies for certain third-party disruptions and delays. From time to time, we 23are, and may become, involved in litigation. We are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others. Such actions could result in the imposition of various remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages, which if awarded could materially harm our business. From time to time, we are, and may become, the subject of inquiries, requests for information, or investigations by government and regulatory agencies regarding our business. Any such matters, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management, damage our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our business.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and manufacturing operations and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations to our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation or the assessment of these claims. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop an alternate non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions. In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Risks associated with owning our common stockOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:•the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects, and the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•the inclusion, exclusion, or removal of our stock from market indices, such as the S&P 500 Index,•our stock repurchase and dividend activities,•the timing of our repayment of outstanding indebtedness,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in the market valuations of other companies, including, but not limited to, those in our industry,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,•domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.24Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect in the future, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We pay, and intend to continue to pay, quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations made by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•our use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•our repayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness,•capital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make it more difficult to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, and•a fair price provision, as well as a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.25"

RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.Risks associated with operating a global businessThe effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely affect our business operations.The global COVID-19 pandemic—including the public health crisis, the measures taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in an effort to limit COVID-19’s spread, and the resulting global supply chain challenges—has adversely affected, and continues to adversely affect, our business operations. The impacts on our business operations and workforce of the pandemic, including as a result of more contagious variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and the duration of such impacts, are uncertain, constantly evolving, and difficult to quantify, but have thus far included, or in the future may include, the following:•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to our supply chain and increased costs in connection with the sourcing of materials, components, equipment, assembly and test services, engineering support, shipping and logistics services, and other services, caused in part by the pandemic. To the extent we are unable to pass these costs on to our customers, we experience reduced profitability. Given that our customers and suppliers are facing similar supply chain challenges, we expect continued difficulty in forecasting demand and supply needs for the foreseeable future. As a result of these uncertainties, we have increased, and may continue to increase, our inventory levels and purchase commitments.•We have recently experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, reduced demand for certain of our products as a result of certain customers’ difficulty to obtain materials, components, and services due to disruptions in such customers’ supply chains. We may experience large fluctuations in demand for certain of our products, which could be exacerbated by global supply chain challenges or by a continued or deepening global economic downturn or recession caused by the pandemic.•In April 2020, we suspended our operations in Mexicali, Mexico, for approximately two weeks pursuant to an order by the government of the state of Baja California, Mexico, resulting in a temporary reduction in our production levels. In the event that our manufacturing operations in Mexicali become subject to significant restrictions or are suspended again, or in the event that one or more of our other facilities is forced to suspend or limit its activities, including, but not limited to, as a result of such operations or activities not being considered to be an “essential” business under applicable laws, regulations, or orders (including “shelter at home” orders or other quarantine-related orders), we may again experience reductions in production levels, which would limit our ability to meet customer demand and impact our operating results.•Over the course of the pandemic, we have implemented certain measures at our facilities worldwide in an effort to protect our employees’ health and well-being (including social distancing, allowing many employees to work remotely, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, screening employees and visitors when entering facilities, educating employees about the virus and preventative measures, enhancing cleaning protocols, and suspending employee travel), some of which have reduced the overall efficiency of our operations and increased manufacturing costs. The expected duration of such protective measures, many of which were still in place as of the end of fiscal 2021, remains uncertain, and we may be required to implement additional measures in the future, further impacting our business operations. In addition, we recently required COVID-19 vaccination of all U.S.-based employees as a condition of employment, subject to certain exemptions, and we may announce additional vaccine mandates in other jurisdictions in the future. Our implementation of these requirements may result in employee attrition, reduced employee morale, and difficulty securing future labor needs.•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reduced production capacity as a result of employee quarantines, absenteeism, and attrition, as well as restrictions on certain of our employees’ ability to work. Additionally, we may experience negative impacts to our sales, marketing, research and development, and other critical business functions for similar reasons.•We have experienced, and likely will continue to experience, disruptions to global transportation networks, limiting or delaying our ability, and/or increasing our cost, to send or receive products and materials at one or more of our facilities, including as a result of trade restrictions, border closures, disruptions in the operations of third-party carriers, or carriers’ decisions to prioritize other customers’ orders over ours.•Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. We may experience negative impacts to our business operations if one or more of these major customers were to significantly decrease its orders for our products due to disruptions to its business operations or other pandemic-related issues.11•Our business operations, as well as the business operations of our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers, are subject to frequent and unpredictable changes in the political, regulatory, legal, or economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which they operate.•The deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets could limit the ability of our customers to pay for product purchases in a timely manner, or at all.•In the event we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligations, lawsuits may be threatened or filed against us by customers or other third parties. In addition, force majeure clauses in our contracts could limit our ability to pursue remedies for certain third-party disruptions and delays.These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer and supplier relations, employee relations, cash flows, and financial condition. The resumption of normal business operations after any such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers. There can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from the pandemic will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods.The degree to which the pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, the timing and magnitude of the U.S. government’s economic stimulus efforts, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy.The risks of doing business internationally apply to all aspects of our operations.We derive significant revenues from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate our own wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Singapore and in Mexicali, Mexico (with a substantial majority of our finished products being assembled and tested in our Mexicali facility). Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating in multiple jurisdictions. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and China, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, restrictions on individuals’ movement, including travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, and curfews, and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, and tariffs), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, insurgencies, and organized crime), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•labor market conditions and laws,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•difficulty in collecting, or failure to collect, accounts receivable, as well as longer collection periods,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters and severe weather events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, as well as other impacts of climate change,•acts of terrorism, widespread illness or other deterioration of public health conditions, and war,•misappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,•difficulty in engaging distribution partners or obtaining sales or other business support in certain jurisdictions,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies, or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,12•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, and•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business have established, or may establish, legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. It is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant resources to comply with the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, competition, data privacy and protection (including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), employment, and labor relations. Violations of one or more of these legal regimes’ laws and regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are subject to the risks of doing business in China.Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, information security, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China, or deemed to be of Chinese origin, and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs, the availability and cost of materials, and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, during fiscal 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei Technology Co., Ltd., and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”), on the Bureau’s Entity List (the “Entity List”), which resulted in our temporarily suspending shipments to Huawei. Since then, the addition of other entities to the Entity List, together with changes to rules regarding the shipment of foreign direct products, resulted in the renewed suspension of shipments to Huawei as well as the suspension of shipments to other customers. In the future, we may be prevented from shipping our products to other customers if they are added to the Entity List. In the absence of further changes to applicable export laws and regulations, we will only be able to sell our products to Huawei and potentially other companies named on the Entity List pursuant to limited export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, China’s investments in technology development and manufacturing capability in support of its stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies has likely already resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase.13On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), which significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operations.Because the changes in U.S. tax law require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued under these laws, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Reform Act or other changes to tax law.Future changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to initiatives related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; the European Commission’s “state aid” investigations; enactment of a global corporate minimum tax; and other developments could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses, including our own. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, evaluate their tax policies and rules on a regular basis, and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation (including as a result of significant changes proposed by the current U.S. presidential administration, such as increases in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and in the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings). We are unable to predict what tax changes may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes could affect our effective tax rates in countries where we have operations and could have an adverse effect on our overall tax position in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.Risks associated with the development, manufacturing, and sale of our productsOur operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•delays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5G networks or in consumer adoption of 5G-enabled devices,•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products (including, but not limited to, market acceptance of new, emerging technologies),•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•delays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment or consumer adoption of certain technologies, •actions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,•changes in consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products).We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, and such projections may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.We rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of 14operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our stock price. In each of fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We rely on Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) to design our products into their end products.Our products are not sold directly to the end user but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex, specialized, and subject to disruption.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, water shortages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results.Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filter wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable 15manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,•required minimum purchase commitments,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, process technologies, and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.Even in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, be unwilling to invest in processes that meet our needs, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters or to severe weather events and other impacts of climate change. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties, delays, or additional costs in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays and/or increased costs in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules; we may lose a significant or sole supplier; a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications; shipments of precious metals may be subject to theft; and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or materials at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, if we lost a supplier, or if a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected because the time required to identify and qualify an alternative supply source, where available, is typically lengthy. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply constraints for certain materials and components, which has impacted, and could continue to impact, production lead times, the cost of such materials and components, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products.In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated. Furthermore, our entry into capacity 16commitments in an attempt to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and components may result in our obligation to pay above-market prices in the event of a future downward price correction.We may not be able to effectively operate our business if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key engineering and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management, engineering, and technical personnel. The competition for management, engineering, and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the locations in which we operate, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies, which in some cases may be able to offer compensation opportunities in excess of what we offer. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given, among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. If we are unable to obtain required stockholder approval for future increases in the number of shares available under our long-term incentive plans, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentive awards, which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities (in the United States or abroad), limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas, and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, and service our international customer base. The increased ability of employees in our industry to work from home or in other remote work arrangements has impacted, and may continue to impact, the mobility and turnover of our employees, potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in the job market. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. In addition, the loss of certain members of our senior management team could harm our relationships with key customers, which could negatively impact our future revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products.Our sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may seek to cancel or defer orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict and may not be accurate. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and/or distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Many of our products are customized to the needs or specifications of a specific customer or have a limited number of potential buyers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. On the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice, which could result in damaged customer relationships, increased liabilities, or harm to our reputation if we are unable to meet such increases in demand. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment, or similar inventory programs that may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products. In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired. Furthermore, our dependence on third-party carriers and logistics firms, many of which have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in, and could continue to result in, delays, increased costs, and expedite fees related to our product shipments.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities (including, but not limited to, capital expenditures), we may need to raise additional funds through public or private 17equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, the future growth of our business is likely to require the expansion of our manufacturing facilities, the upgrade of our manufacturing equipment, strategic investments, and/or corporate acquisitions. The capital required to fund these investments may not be available in the future.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Labs.On July 26, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets, rights, and properties, and assumed certain liabilities, comprising Silicon Labs’ Infrastructure and Automotive business.Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the Company’s ability to successfully integrate the assets acquired and employees transferred in connection with the Acquisition, as well as the Company’s ability to maintain and/or secure relationships with third-party manufacturing partners in order to meet customer demand for the products acquired in the Acquisition. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition in the expected timeframe or at all could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition, which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business.On May 21, 2021, the Company, as borrower, entered into a term credit agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $1.0 billion Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on May 26, 2021, the Company issued $500 million of its 0.900% 2023 Notes, $500 million of its 1.800% 2026 Notes, and $500 million of its 3.000% 2031 Notes in a public offering. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of Notes were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. Additionally, on May 21, 2021, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $750 million Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries. This indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. We also have incurred, and will continue to incur, various costs and expenses associated with our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. The incurrence of this or any additional indebtedness could reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Acquisition, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted. Even if we achieve the anticipated benefits from the Acquisition, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial, and business conditions as well as other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.In addition, our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. An inability to obtain or maintain a rating could increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings of our indebtedness, limit our access to sources of financing in the future, or lead to other potentially adverse consequences.The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The agreements that govern the Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and the Revolver contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, change the nature of our business, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain assets to any one person. In addition, some of the agreements contain a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage. Our ability to 18comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Any such acceleration of our repayment obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or stock price. To be successful we may need to make additional investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Risks associated with our industryThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. In addition, the rapid increase in consumer demand for certain devices and technologies that enable remote work, education, and entertainment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could limit future consumer demand for such products. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could adversely affect our stock price.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and rapid loss of market share. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, and Qualcomm.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies, and/or state-sponsored investments, intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps),•timely new product innovation,•ability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G,19•product quality, reliability, and performance,•ability of certain products, including “high reliability” solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions,•product cost and selling price,•features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications,•compliance with industry standards,•strategic relationships with customers,•access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property,•ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•long presence in key markets,•brand recognition,•high levels of customer satisfaction,•vertical integration,•strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,•ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and•strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partner’s baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, causing such competitors to rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to constantly innovate.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity within an international supply chain to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, •to source and maintain manufacturing materials, and•to obtain adequate multi-jurisdictional intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.20We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth and technologies. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance, or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products in a timely manner and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries and form factors. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. We have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries and packaging sub-contractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our manufacturing partners may not be able to effectively manage the transition, or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain manufacturing partners. If our manufacturing partners or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, regulations, and customer expectations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive 21disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. In addition, our customers may begin to require reports on our sourcing of other minerals or substances, which may impact our ongoing operations and increase our operating costs.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.In addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics such as climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, human capital, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We expect that these and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations, and expectations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, will continue to increase the cost of our compliance and internal risk management programs and to alter the environment in which we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Risks associated with cybersecurity and intellectual property protectionWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, information technology security breaches.Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, networks, and databases, and other cyberattacks continue to become more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers and networks (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to prevent, detect, and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business, financial, and/or technical information, or the personal data of our employees and customers by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business and technology development. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’, or employees’ confidential or personal information, we may incur liability, face contractual and regulatory fines and penalties, and sustain significant financial resources to remediate such breach. Such an incident could, among other things, also damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, impact our stock price, and materially damage our supplier relationships. If a ransom-style cyberattack or similar incident impedes our ability to use or access our information systems for an extended period of time, this could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. In addition, certain suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity incidents, misappropriation efforts, or network disruptions that could jeopardize our proprietary or sensitive data, impact such third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us, or otherwise negatively impact our ongoing business operations. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and databases, including through the training of our employees and monitoring the security posture of critical third parties who have access to our systems or sensitive data. However, we cannot ensure that these security measures and monitoring efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our systems may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, theft, system malfunctions, or other adverse events. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.In order to remain competitive, we must be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-22disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity, enforceability, and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful,•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented, and•we may be contractually prohibited, or otherwise discouraged, by certain customers from pursuing remedies for third parties’ violations of our intellectual property.A third party could potentially copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology or could be rendered invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including current and former employees, consultants, customers, licensees, suppliers, vendors, and other third-party affiliates may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our manufacturing and other business operations being interrupted. While we make reasonable attempts to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation, we may be unable to anticipate or detect the methods used, or we may be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.We are subject to the risks of licensing third-party intellectual property.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Many of our products currently use or incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology for our current or future products become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share, and our business could be adversely affected. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products. These risks are heightened with respect to certain of our products that incorporate increasing amounts of digital circuit content that is subject to third-party intellectual property rights.Risks associated with claims and litigationWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, liability claims, and risks of litigation.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, from time to time we become aware of alleged defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including “high reliability” solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our “high reliability” solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, medical, and military markets. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. In addition, because our customers typically integrate our products into other devices, and because we typically do not have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products, our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. Depending on the nature of any product defect claims, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. Investigating, analyzing, and/or remediating alleged product defects may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, product redesigns, or obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation 23may be damaged, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.In addition, from time to time, we are, and may become, involved in litigation. We are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others. Such actions could result in the imposition of various remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages, which if awarded could materially harm our business. From time to time, we are, and may become, the subject of inquiries, requests for information, or investigations by government and regulatory agencies regarding our business. Any such matters, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management, damage our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our business.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and manufacturing operations and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations to our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation or the assessment of these claims. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop an alternate non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Risks associated with owning our common stockOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:•the extent of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic,•the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects, and the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•the inclusion, exclusion, or removal of our stock from market indices, such as the S&P 500 Index,•our stock repurchase and dividend activities,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in the market valuations of other companies, including, but not limited to, those in our industry,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,•domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.24Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect in the future, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•our use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•our repayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness,•capital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, and•a fair price provision, as well as a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.25"
3,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2020-11-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.  Risks associated with operating a global business in many international jurisdictionsThe effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic are adversely affecting our business operations.The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic—including both the resulting public health crisis as well as the measures being taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in an effort to limit COVID-19’s spread—has adversely affected, and continues to adversely affect, our business operations. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and workforce, and the duration of such impacts, are uncertain, constantly evolving, and difficult to quantify, but have thus far included, or in the future may include, the following:•We have experienced large fluctuations in the demand for our products, including a significant decrease in overall demand in the initial stages of the pandemic followed more recently by substantial increases in demand for certain of our products. We may experience continued large fluctuations in demand or a reduction in the pricing of our products, either of which could be exacerbated by a continued or deepening global economic downturn or recession caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.•In April 2020, we suspended our operations in Mexicali, Mexico, for approximately two weeks pursuant to an order by the government of the state of Baja California, Mexico, resulting in the temporary reduction in our production levels. In the event that our manufacturing operations in Mexicali become subject to significant restrictions or are suspended again, or in the event that one or more of our other facilities is forced to suspend or limit its activities, including, but not limited to, as a result of such operations or activities not being considered to be an “essential” business under applicable laws, regulations, or orders (including “shelter at home” orders or other quarantine-related orders), we may experience further reductions in production levels, which would limit our ability to meet customer demand and impact our operating results.•We have implemented certain measures at our facilities worldwide in an effort to protect our employees’ health and well-being (including social distancing, allowing many employees to work remotely, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, screening employees and visitors when entering facilities, educating employees about the virus and preventative measures, enhancing cleaning protocols, and suspending employee travel), some of which have reduced the overall efficiency of our operations and increased manufacturing costs. The expected duration of such protective measures remains uncertain, and we may be required to implement additional measures in the future, further impacting our business operations.•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reduced production capacity as a result of employee quarantines, absenteeism, and attrition, as well as restrictions on certain of our employees’ ability to work. Additionally, we may experience negative impacts to our sales, marketing, research and development, and other critical business functions for similar reasons.•Given the difficulty of forecasting demand and supply needs, and given that our suppliers are facing similar challenges as a result of the pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials, components, equipment, assembly and test services, engineering support, and other services.•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to global transportation networks, limiting or delaying our ability, and/or increasing our cost, to send or receive products and materials at one or more of our facilities, including as a result of trade restrictions, border closures, or disruptions in the operations of third-party carriers.•Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. We may experience negative impacts to our business operations if one or more of these major customers were to significantly decrease its orders for our products due to disruptions to its business operations or other pandemic-related issues.•Our business operations, as well as the business operations of our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers, are subject to frequent and unpredictable changes in the political, regulatory, legal, or economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which they operate.•The deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets could limit the ability of our customers to pay for product purchases in a timely manner, or at all.•In the event we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligations, lawsuits may be threatened or filed against us by customers or other third parties. In addition, force majeure clauses in our contracts could limit our ability to pursue remedies for certain third-party disruptions and delays.11These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer and supplier relations, employee relations, cash flows, and financial condition. The resumption of normal business operations after any such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers. There can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from COVID-19 will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods.The degree to which COVID-19 impacts us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, the timing and magnitude of the U.S. government’s economic stimulus efforts, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy.The risks of doing business internationally apply to all aspects of our operations.We derive significant revenues from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate our own wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore (with a substantial majority of our finished products being assembled and tested in our Mexicali facility). Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and China, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, restrictions on individuals’ movement, including travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, and curfews, and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, and tariffs), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, insurgencies, and organized crime), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•labor market conditions and laws,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness or other deterioration of public health conditions, and war,•misappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,•difficulty in engaging distribution partners or obtaining sales or other business support in certain jurisdictions,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies, or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns,•the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings and potential penalties in a foreign jurisdiction, and/or increased compliance expense, as a result of the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection (including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), employment, and labor relations, and12•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are subject to the risks of doing business in China.Although we intend to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China or deemed to be of Chinese origin and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, during fiscal 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei Technology Co., Ltd., and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) on the Bureau’s Entity List (the “Entity List”), which resulted in our temporarily suspending shipments to Huawei. During fiscal 2020, the addition of other entities to the Entity List (with the prospect of more entities to be added in the future), together with changes to rules regarding the shipment of foreign direct products, again resulted in the suspension of shipments to Huawei. In the absence of further changes to applicable export laws and regulations, we will only be able to sell our products to Huawei and potentially other companies named on the Entity List pursuant to limited export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, China’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies could result in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), which significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operations.Because the changes in U.S. tax law require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued under these laws, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits. It is also possible that Congress will enact legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act enacted in March 2020, some of which could have an impact on our operations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Reform Act or other changes to tax law.13Future changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to initiatives related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; the European Commission’s “state aid” investigations; and other developments could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses, including our own. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, evaluate their tax policies and rules on a regular basis, and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation (including as a result of any changes proposed during the next U.S. presidential administration). We are unable to predict what tax changes may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes could affect our effective tax rates in countries where we have operations and could have an adverse effect on our overall tax position in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.Risks associated with the development, manufacturing, and sale of our productsOur operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•delays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5G networks or in consumer adoption of 5G-enabled devices,•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•market acceptance of our products and our customer’s products (including, but not limited to, market acceptance of new, emerging technologies),•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•delays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment or consumer adoption of certain technologies, •actions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,•changes in consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products).We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, and such projections may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.We rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our stock price. In each of fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 14 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We rely on Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) to design our products into their end products.Our products are not sold directly to the end user but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, 14achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex, specialized, and subject to disruption.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results.Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filter wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, process technologies, and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.15Even in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, be unwilling to invest in processes that meet our needs, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties, delays, or additional costs in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services from these suppliers on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays and/or costs in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.We may not be able to effectively operate our business if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies, which in some cases may be able to offer compensation opportunities in excess of what we offer. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given, among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. If we are unable to obtain required stockholder approval for future increases in the number of shares available under our long-term incentive plans, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentive awards, which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, and service our international customer base. The increased ability for employees in our industry to work from home or in other remote work arrangements could increase employee mobility and turnover, potentially making it more difficult for us to 16compete in the job market. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. In addition, the loss of certain members of our senior management team could harm our relationships with key customers, which could negatively impact our future revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products.Our sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may seek to cancel or defer orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and/or distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Many of our products are customized to the needs or specifications of a specific customer or have a limited number of potential buyers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. On the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice, which could result in damaged customer relationships, increased liabilities, or harm to our reputation if we are unable to meet such increases in demand. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment, or similar inventory programs that may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products. In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities (including, but not limited to, capital expenditures), we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, the future growth of our business is likely to require the expansion of our manufacturing facilities, the upgrade of our manufacturing equipment, strategic investments, and/or corporate acquisitions. The capital required to fund these investments may not be available in the future.Risks associated with our industryThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, it is difficult to predict what impact the outcomes of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections in November 2020 may have on economic conditions, consumer confidence, geopolitical turmoil, civil unrest, and future legislation and regulation. In addition, the rapid increase in consumer demand for certain devices and technologies that enable remote work, education, and entertainment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could limit future consumer demand for such products. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could adversely affect our stock price.17The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and rapid loss of market share. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, and Qualcomm.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps),•timely new product innovation,•ability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G,•product quality, reliability, and performance,•ability of certain products, including “high reliability” solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions,•product cost and selling price,•features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications,•compliance with industry standards,•strategic relationships with customers,•access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property,•ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•long presence in key markets,•brand recognition,•high levels of customer satisfaction,•vertical integration,•strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,•ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and•strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partner’s baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to constantly innovate.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of 18integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity within an international supply chain to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, •to source and maintain manufacturing materials, and•to obtain adequate multi-jurisdictional intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth and technologies. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance, or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products in a timely manner and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries and form factors. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. We have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries and packaging sub-contractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our manufacturing partners may not be able to effectively manage the transition, or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain manufacturing partners. If our manufacturing partners or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, regulations, and customer expectations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.19A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. In addition, our customers may begin to require reports on our sourcing of other minerals or substances, which may impact our ongoing operations and increase our operating costs.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition, or competitive position.Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.To be successful we may need to make investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Risks associated with cybersecurity and intellectual property protectionWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, information technology security breaches.20Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, networks, and databases and other cyberattacks continue to become more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers and networks (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business and/or technical information, or the personal data of our employees and customers by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business and technology development. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’, or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability, face contractual and regulatory fines and penalties, and sustain significant financial resources to remediate such breach. Such an incident could, among other things, also damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, impact our stock price, and materially damage supplier relationships. If such incident impedes our inability to use or access our information systems for an extended period of time, this could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. In addition, certain suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity incidents or network disruptions that could jeopardize our proprietary or sensitive data, impact such third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us, or otherwise negatively impact our ongoing business operations. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and databases, including through the training of our employees and monitoring the security posture of critical third parties who have access to our systems or sensitive data. However, we cannot ensure that these security measures and monitoring efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our systems may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, system malfunctions or other adverse events. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.In order to remain competitive, we must be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity, enforceability, and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful,•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented, and•we may be contractually prohibited, or otherwise discouraged, by certain customers from pursuing remedies for third parties’ violations of our intellectual property.A third party could copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology or could be rendered invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including current and former employees, consultants, customers, licensees, suppliers, vendors, and other third-party affiliates may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our manufacturing and other business operations being interrupted. While we make reasonable attempts to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation, we may be unable to anticipate or detect the methods used, or we may be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.21We are subject to the risks of licensing third-party intellectual property.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Many of our products currently use or incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology for our current or future products become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share, and our business could be adversely affected. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.Risks associated with claims, litigation, and legal complianceWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, from time to time we become aware of alleged defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including “high reliability” solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our “high reliability” solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, medical, and military markets. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. In addition, because we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products, our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. Depending on the nature of any product defect claims, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. Investigating, analyzing, and/or remediating alleged product defects may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, product redesigns, or obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and manufacturing operations and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop an alternate non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.22Risks associated with owning our common stockOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:•the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•the inclusion, exclusion, or removal of our stock from market indices, such as the S&P 500 Index,•our stock repurchase and dividend activities,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,•domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect in the future, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•capital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,23•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.24"
11,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2019-11-14,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may impair our business operations, financial condition, or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•delays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment of certain technologies (including, but not limited to, 5G),•actions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,•changes in consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customer’s products (including, but not limited to, market acceptance of 5G products), and•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products). We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, projections which may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from  10Table of Contentsprevious estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In each of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. In fiscal 2017, three customers each accounted for ten percent or greater of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, and Qualcomm.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps), •timely new product innovation, •ability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G, •product quality, reliability, and performance, 11Table of Contents•ability of certain products, including “high reliability” solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •vertical integration,•strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partner’s baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial, or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from shipments to customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore. Our international  12Table of Contentssales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and China, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, •restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, and tariffs), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, insurgencies, and organized crime), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•labor market conditions and workers’ rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness, and war,•misappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings and potential penalties in a foreign jurisdiction, and/or increased compliance expense, as a result of the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection (including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), employment, and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and/or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. 13Table of ContentsWe are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China. Although we intend to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China or deemed to be of Chinese origin and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei and certain of its affiliates on the Bureau’s Entity List, which resulted in our temporarily suspending shipments to Huawei, and which is expected to adversely affect future demand for our products from this customer. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Finally, China’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies could result in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized, and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results.Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filter wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs. 14Table of ContentsRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products, reduce costs in a timely manner, transition to smaller geometry process technologies, and achieve higher levels of design integration.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain foundries. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including “high reliability” solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our “high reliability” solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, medical, and military markets. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. Depending on the nature of the product defects, we may not be able to recoup our losses  15Table of Contentsfrom our third-party suppliers. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, or other obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.Even in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services from these suppliers on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, or service our international customer base. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. 16Table of ContentsOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products, could adversely affect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and/or distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment, or similar inventory programs which may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products.In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology security breaches.Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and other cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers and networks (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business information, or the personal data of our employees by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’ or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees. However, we cannot ensure that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cyberattack, cybersecurity incident, or network disruption.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such  17Table of Contentsthird-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented.A third party could copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection, and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected. 18Table of ContentsWe sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•capital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Changes in tax laws and regulations worldwide could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, our tax liability in general could increase. The tax legislation (the “Tax Reform Act”), enacted by the United States in December 2017, included several changes to U.S. tax laws that have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our operations, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, base-erosion prevention measures on earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign jurisdictions. Because these changes require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in: 19Table of Contents•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 20Table of ContentsCertain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met"
15,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2018-11-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customer’s products, and•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers’ products).  10Table of ContentsWe employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, projections which may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2018, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. In fiscal 2017, three customers each accounted for ten percent or greater of our net revenue. In fiscal 2016, two customers each accounted for ten percent or greater of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 17 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and•our ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock. Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others: 11Table of Contents•rapid time-to-market and product ramps, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •vertical integration,•strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from shipments to customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.  12Table of ContentsOur international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and China, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, •labor market conditions and workers’ rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, increased import or export controls and tariffs) that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings and potential penalties in a foreign jurisdiction, and/or increased compliance expense, as a result of the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection (including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and/or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China. We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including  13Table of Contentsthose relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China or deemed to be of Chinese origin and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Finally, China’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies could result in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized, and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California, or Woburn, Massachusetts, semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico, for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our SAW and TC-SAW filter manufacturing process is also specialized in nature and in the event of a disruption in production at our filter wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan and Osaka, Japan or in our filter assembly and test facility in Singapore, for any reason, alternative filter production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs. 14Table of ContentsRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products, reduce costs in a timely manner, transition to smaller geometry process technologies, and achieve higher levels of design integration.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain foundries. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. Depending on the nature of the product defects, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls,  15Table of Contentsindemnification claims, or other obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies and IP blocks.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, could make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company or service our international customer base. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products, could adversely affect our business. 16Table of ContentsOur sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and/or distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment or similar inventory programs which may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products. In addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s or distributor’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology security breaches.Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and other cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business information, or the personal data of our employees by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’ or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees. However, we cannot ensure that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cyberattack, cybersecurity incident or network disruption.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions: 17Table of Contents•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products. 18Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.Future cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•capital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Changes in tax laws and regulations worldwide could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, our tax liability in general could increase. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.The new tax legislation (the “Tax Reform Act”), enacted by the United States in December 2017, included several changes to U.S. tax laws that will have a significant impact on our operations, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, base-erosion prevention measures on earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign jurisdictions. Because these changes require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition, 19Table of Contents•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. Various jurisdictions are developing other climate change-based regulations, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us. 20Table of ContentsWe have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met"
16,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2017-11-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customer’s products, and 10Table of Contents•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.We employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, projections which may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  In fiscal 2017, three customers each accounted for ten percent of greater of our net revenue.  In fiscal 2016, two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  In fiscal 2015, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 16 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.  Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased  11Table of Contentschallenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.  As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product  12Table of Contentsdevelopment and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and in Singapore. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic and political instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships between the United States and Mexico, Russia, China, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, and related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, •labor market conditions and workers’ rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, increased import or export controls and tariffs) that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which Skyworks does business,•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions, subsidies or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements,•withdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which Skyworks does business,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes proposed in the U.S. regarding corporate taxes, the taxation of income earned outside the U.S., and the taxation of imported and exported goods and services, as well as changes in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction given the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and / or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues. 13Table of ContentsSome of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized, and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our SAW and TC-SAW filter manufacturing process is also specialized in nature and in the event of a disruption in production at our filter wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan and Osaka, Japan  or in our filter assembly and test facility in Singapore, for any reason, alternative filter production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may  14Table of Contentsrequire us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products, reduce costs in a timely manner, transition to smaller geometry process technologies, and achieve higher levels of design integration.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain foundries. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential  15Table of Contentsliabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped.  Depending on the nature of the product defects, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers.  These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:•the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate assembly and test facilities, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, could make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company or service our international customer base. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. 16Table of ContentsOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, licensees’ or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions: 17Table of Contents•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or in our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation.  If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could  18Table of Contentslose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders.Future cash dividends may be affected by, among other factors:•our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,•our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,•capital requirements related to stock repurchase programs,•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and•changes to our business model.Our cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.Changes in tax regulations and changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiary in Singapore could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide.  To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, our tax liability in general could increase. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all.  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. 19Table of ContentsMoreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources.  The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. Various jurisdictions are developing other climate change-based regulations, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as: 20Table of Contents•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•no stockholder right to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met"
1,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2016-11-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time and may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory and restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers, and 10Table of Contents•intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2014, two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  In fiscal 2015, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 16 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•instability in global credit and financial markets,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.  Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. We intend to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: •our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development;•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions;•capital requirements related to stock repurchase programs;•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and 11Table of Contents•changes to our business model.Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramps, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.  As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted. 12Table of ContentsCurrent and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative  13Table of Contentsexpenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all. 14Table of ContentsWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.  Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate an assembly and test facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited  15Table of Contentsnumber of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and 16Table of Contents•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or in our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in  17Table of ContentsKadoma, Japan and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and in Singapore. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•labor market conditions and workers’ rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments (including changes proposed in certain countries in Europe and elsewhere regarding corporate taxes, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions),•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction given the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and / or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased  18Table of Contentstaxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.  Changes in tax regulations and changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiary in Singapore could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide.  To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all.  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.  19Table of ContentsA number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources.  The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.  Furthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•no stockholder right to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, 20Table of Contents•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems"
0,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2015-11-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time and may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Although we believe that the market for our semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory and restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers, 10Table of Contents•our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-core intellectual property, and •intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2015, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  In fiscal 2014, two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 16 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.  Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. We intend to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: •our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development;•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions;•capital requirements related to stock repurchase programs;•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and 11Table of Contents•changes to our business model.Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Current uncertainties regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power and demand from of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, customers or distributors could result in product delays and increased accounts receivable defaults. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.  Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Analog Devices, Avago Technologies, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramp, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,  12Table of Contents•ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win”  13Table of Contentsfrom a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may  14Table of Contentsrequire us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.  Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate an assembly and test facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing  15Table of Contentscapacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivables could be impaired. 16Table of ContentsWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. 17Table of ContentsDespite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or in our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan and Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and in Singapore. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•labor market conditions and workers’ rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments,•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction given the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and / or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to  18Table of Contentsthe same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.  Changes in tax regulations and/or changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiary in Singapore could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide.  To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase or our tax saving strategies could be threatened. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all.  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and 19Table of Contents•    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources.  The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20Table of ContentsIf wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the Federal Communications Committee (“FCC”) and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for wireless communications devices that contain our products.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is often more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Further, silicon based designs offer alternatives within the system architecture which are unavailable for gallium arsenide based designs.  Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over silicon-based alternatives. Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offer gallium arsenide products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our factories could become underutilized adversely affecting our operating results. As a result of underutilization, we could expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance.  We may not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide products.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•no stockholder right to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  21Table of Contentsor specified stockholder approval requirements are met.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information by third parties or by Skyworks employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems"
9,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2014-11-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time and may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Although we believe that the market for our semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory  10Table of Contentsand restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers,•our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-core intellectual property, and •intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.    The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock  11Table of Contentsattractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.  Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. In March 2014, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program. We intend to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: •our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development;•use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions;•capital requirements related to stock repurchase programs;•changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and•changes to our business model.Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Current uncertainties regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power and demand from of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, customers or distributors could result in product delays and increased accounts receivable defaults. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.  Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Analog Devices, Avago Technologies, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, QUALCOMM, RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramp, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price,  12Table of Contents•features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers' purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products. 13Table of ContentsOur ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers' requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier's product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors and customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14Table of ContentsLengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our  15Table of Contentsgallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.  Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers' needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate an assembly and test facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, limiting the pool of available talent.  16Table of ContentsWe continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2014 and 2013, two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 16 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer's ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivables could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions. 17Table of ContentsIn addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers' products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or in our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we maintain wafer fabrication facilities in Kadoma, Japan and Uozu, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and in Singapore. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding: 18Table of Contents•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•labor market conditions and worker's rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations,•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction given the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and / or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.   19Table of ContentsChanges in tax regulations and/or changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiary in Singapore could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide.  To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase or our tax saving strategies could be threatened. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all).  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are  20Table of Contentscurrently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources.  The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers may decrease. Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the Federal Communications Committee (“FCC”) and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for wireless communications devices that contain our products.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is often more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Further, silicon based designs offer alternatives within the system architecture which  21Table of Contentsare unavailable for gallium arsenide based designs.  Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over silicon-based alternatives. Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offer gallium arsenide products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our factories could become underutilized adversely affecting our operating results. As a result of underutilization, we could expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance.  We may not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide products.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•no stockholder right to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems"
8,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2013-11-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time and may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets.  Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Although we believe that the market for our semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory and restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers, 11Table of Contents•our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-core intellectual property, and •intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.    The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,•our revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.  Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets, exacerbated by the European debt crisis, the recent shutdown of the United Stated federal government, and fears that the United States federal government's credit rating may be downgraded as a result of a failure (or threatened failure) to increase the federal government's debt ceiling.  These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power and demand from of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, customers or distributors could result in product delays and increased accounts receivable defaults. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.  Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  12Table of ContentsThe wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Analog Devices, Avago Technologies, Hittite Microwave, Linear Technologies, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, Peregrine Semiconductor, RF Micro Devices, and Triquint Semiconductor. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramp, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product cost and selling price, •features available in products,•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/ participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Our baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers' purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and  13Table of Contentscharacterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•to achieve overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers' requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier's product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable  14Table of Contentsmanufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors and customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all. 15Table of ContentsWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.  Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.  Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers' needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate an assembly and test facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for  16Table of Contentsour manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer's ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivables could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.  17Table of ContentsAny litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers' products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries. 18Table of ContentsWe attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or in our operations being interrupted. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging, assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•labor market conditions and worker's rights,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations,•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction given the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings and / or funds and the unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Some of the countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations  19Table of Contentsof one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.  Changes in tax regulations and/or changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiary in Singapore could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide.  To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase or our tax saving strategies could be threatened. For example, our subsidiary in Singapore receives a tax holiday that is expected to be effective through September 2020. Changes in the status of this tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all).  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. 20Table of ContentsIncreasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (""RoHS"") Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.The SEC recently adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the United States Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 21Table of ContentsIf wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers may decrease. Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the Federal Communications Committee (""FCC"") and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for wireless communications devices that contain our products.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is often more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Further, silicon based designs offer alternatives within the system architecture which are unavailable for gallium arsenide based designs.  Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over silicon-based alternatives. Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offer gallium arsenide products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our factories could become underutilized adversely affecting our operating results. As a result of underutilization, we could expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance.  We may not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide products.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•no stockholder right to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law  22Table of Contentsgenerally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems"
12,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2012-11-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations, financial condition or results from operations.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Continued uncertain economic conditions worldwide, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Although we believe that the market for our semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.  Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and restructuring and/or impairment charges.  Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.  These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers,•our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-core intellectual property, and •intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.    The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many 11Table of Contentsfactors, including:    •the volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers,•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates, price targets or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions,•domestic and international tax and fiscal policy decisions (including the possibility of expiring tax cuts combined with mandatory reductions in federal spending in the United States), and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, including the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with United States and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Analog Devices, Avago Technologies, Hittite Microwave, Linear Technologies, Maxim Integrated Products, Peregrine Semiconductor, RF Micro Devices, and Triquint Semiconductor. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing gross margin and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramp, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product price, •features available in products,12Table of Contents•alignment with customer performance specifications, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, •ability to partner with/ participate in reference designs of baseband vendors, and•maintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, •brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •strong baseband partnership/ participation in reference designs,•a broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers' purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,13Table of Contents•for overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards and expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers' requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products and thereby remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier's product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors and customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, 14Table of Contentswhich could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities as well as our assembly and test facility in Mexicali Mexico for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at significant amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations.  If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.  Further, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers' needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.15Table of ContentsAlthough we own and operate an assembly and test facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal year 2012 two customers, Foxconn and Samsung Electronics each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 18 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before 16Table of Contentsgenerating any revenues related to those products.After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, master service agreements, etc. and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer's ability to make timely payments to us for non-returnable products could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.17Table of ContentsMany of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers' products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.  Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging, assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including changes in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•labor market conditions and worker's rights,18Table of Contents•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),•changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•limitations on the repatriation of funds,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•direct or indirect government actions or policies aimed at supporting local industry,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations,•changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates•results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, •limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction, and•restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign earnings or unfavorable tax impactions related to the same.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.We are particularly exposed to risks of doing business in China.  We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights.  Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers which would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.  We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities or repay future debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all).  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business 19Table of Contentscircumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on sustainability and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them.  We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue for the foreseeable future which will result in higher costs of operations.  In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (""RoHS"") Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.The SEC recently adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements, which will apply to our activities in calendar 2013, will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the U.S. Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The U.S. Environmental Protection 20Table of ContentsAgency (“EPA”) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers may decrease. Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the Federal Communications Committee (""FCC"") and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for wireless communications devices that contain our products.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Further, silicon based designs offer alternatives within the system architecture which are unavailable for gallium arsenide based designs.  Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts. Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offer gallium arsenide products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance.  We may not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide products.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, transactions, restructuring or other impairment write-offs,21Table of Contents•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•recognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are 22Table of Contentssometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we expect to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets, exacerbated by the ongoing European debt crisis. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power and demand from of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays and increased accounts receivable defaults. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.  Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected"
5,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2011-11-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations, financial condition or results from operations.We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.We operate primarily in the wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in 9Table of Contentsdemand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Continued uncertain economic conditions worldwide, together with other factors such as the continued volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.  Although we believe that the market for wireless communications semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in another market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.  Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and restructuring and/or impairment charges.  Furthermore, downturns in the wireless communications semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly and annual basis in prior fiscal years and our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:•changes in end-user demand for the products (principally cellular handsets) manufactured and sold by our customers,•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,•production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,•availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,•the gain or loss of significant customers,•our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,•new product and technology introductions by competitors,•changes in the mix of products produced and sold,•market acceptance of our products and our customers,•our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-core intellectual property, and •intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.    The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:    •the recent unprecedented volatility of the financial markets,•uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,•our performance and prospects,•the performance and prospects of our major customers,10Table of Contents•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,•investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,•changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, •domestic and international political conditions, and•the ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquisition candidates.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has and continues to significantly and negatively affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, including the market price of our common stock.  Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price.  If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possible substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with United States and international semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Avago Technologies, RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:•rapid time-to-market and product ramp, •timely new product innovation, •product quality, reliability and performance, •product price, •features available in products, •compliance with industry standards, •strategic relationships with customers, •access to and protection of intellectual property, and •maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost. We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the benefit of:•long presence in key markets, 11Table of Contents•brand recognition, •high levels of customer satisfaction, •ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and •strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.  We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets into which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:•to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,•to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand,•to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,•to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,•to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,•for overall market acceptance of our products,•to lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand, and•to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among other factors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time.  Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products.  12Table of ContentsAccordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.  We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason.  We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on our business.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption in production at our Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at significant amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts.  If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, 13Table of Contentscause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: •the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,•limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality assurance, and•the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take an extended period of time to complete our qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products. However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.  Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.  If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers.  If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.14Table of ContentsOur reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010, Foxconn, Nokia and Samsung Electronics each accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further discussion see Note 18 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for non-returnable products could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology. 15Table of ContentsThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:•pay substantial damages,•cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,•discontinue the use of infringing technology,•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products.  If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete successfully may be materially and adversely affected.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.   Regardless of our actions:•the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties may not be successful, and16Table of Contents•any of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our operations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenue is derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging, assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:•currency exchange rate fluctuations, including changes in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,•local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,•disruptions of capital and trading markets,•inability to collect accounts receivable,•restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased import or export controls and tariffs),• changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,•natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,•limitations on the repatriation of funds,•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,•cultural differences in the conduct of business,•the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,•changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations,•our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, •the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and17Table of Contents•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all).  Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions may not be available in the future.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (""RoHS"") Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental 18Table of Contentsregulations.  The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers may decrease. Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the Federal Communications Committee (""FCC"") and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for our solutions and those of our licensees and customers in the United States as well as foreign countries.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts. Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offer gallium arsenide products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance.  We may not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions.To be successful we may need to make certain investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:•    issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,•    large, one-time write-offs,•    the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,•    the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,•    amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and•    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.19Table of ContentsCertain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,•elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act by written consent,•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares,•a fair price provision, and•a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met"
7,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2010-11-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other informationcontained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial conditionor results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or otherfactors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also mayimpair our business operations, financial condition or results from operations.We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subjectto significant downturns.We operate primarily in the wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is cyclical andsubject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprisemarkets. Since late 2008, uncertain economic conditions worldwide, together with other factors suchas the continued volatility of the financial markets, have made it difficult for our customers andfor us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.11Table of ContentsAlthough we believe that themarket for wireless communications semiconductor products has stabilized, continueduncertainty and economic weakness could result in another market contraction and, as a result, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations would likely bematerially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized bydiminished product demand and revenues, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels,accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and restructuring and/or impairment charges.Furthermore, downturns in the wireless communications semiconductor industry may be prolonged, andany extended delay or failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economicdownturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations beyond our current fiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuationsand market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly andannual basis in prior fiscal years and our revenues, earnings and other operating results mayfluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which arebeyond our control.These factors include, among others:  changes in end-user demand for the products (principally cellular handsets)manufactured and sold by our customers,   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling pricesof our products,   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,   availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,   the gain or loss of significant customers,   our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timelybasis,   new product and technology introductions by competitors,   changes in the mix of products produced and sold,   market acceptance of our products and our customers,   our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-coreintellectual property, and   intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associatedwith the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, couldmaterially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating resultsfail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affectthe price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Suchfluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:  the recent unprecedented volatility of the financial markets,   uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,12Table of Contents  our performance and prospects,   the performance and prospects of our major customers,   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, and   domestic and international political conditions.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. Thisvolatility significantly and negatively affected the market prices of securities of many technologycompanies, including the market price of our common stock in late 2008 and early 2009. The returnof such volatility could result in broad market fluctuations that could materially and adverselyaffect the market price of our common stock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our tradingmultiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shiftfunds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Ourcompany has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Suchcommentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meetthe expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price maydecline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competitionwhich may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and maymaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we competein particular are very competitive. We compete with United States and international semiconductormanufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including Avago Technologies, RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and productcompetition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to resultin, declining average selling pricesfor our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share. Furthermore,additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communicationselectronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors andtechnological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors forsemiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:  rapid time-to-market and product ramp,   timely new product innovation,   product quality, reliability and performance,   product price,   features available in products,   compliance with industry standards,   strategic relationships with customers,   access to and protection of intellectual property, and13Table of Contents  maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy thebenefit of:  long presence in key markets,   brand recognition,   high levels of customer satisfaction,   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical orother resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to thedevelopment, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial orstrategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. Theserelationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that newcompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant marketshare. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors.Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of marketshare and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets intowhich we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapidtechnological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards,short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increasedminiaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Ouroperating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new andenhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization ofsemiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:  the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes intechnology and industry standards,   the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand,   the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,   the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on atimely basis,   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,   overall market acceptance of our products,   the length of time that a particular product is in demand, and   the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among otherfactors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or ITSystems.14Table of ContentsWe will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and tochoose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We maynot be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor productsin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements orachieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards andtechnological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcementsand introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementaryproducts of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly andcost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet ourcustomers requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adverselyharmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Ourproducts may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allowus to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe thatto remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existingproducts at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not beable to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive.If Original Equipment Manufactures, or OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do notdesign our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of otherproducts. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products toselect our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Withoutthese design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designsanother suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after adesign win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time toreduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commerciallysuccessful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convertdesign wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect ouroperating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyondour control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise processconsisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, cleanenvironment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step ofthe fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects inequipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantialpercentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because ouroperating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits atacceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations atany of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result fromelectrical power outages, fire,15Table of Contentsearthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories orrisks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/orupgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could causesignificant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facilityor subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, the requiredalternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timelybasis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available,we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or aloss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand,either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturingprocess, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusettssemiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide productioncapacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls and liability claims.Although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, wemay discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may berequired to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty andindemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilitiesassociated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped atsignificant amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resourcesfrom other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers orothers, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other obligations undercustomer contracts, which may adversely impact our operating results. If any of our productscontain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may bedamaged and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospectivecustomers and could adversely affect our operating results.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to ourgross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturingyield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for newproducts initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volumemanufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forwardproduct pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yieldsand, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have adirect effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecastingmanufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yieldswill continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductorproducts. Our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression ofproduct life cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorterperiods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases,reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields anddeclining costs.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-basedproducts and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significantrisks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:  the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and qualityassurance, and   the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.16Table of ContentsAlthough we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturingcapacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocatetheir limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers. If we choose to use a newfoundry, it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification processbefore we can begin shipping products from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financialdifficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage ordestruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones.If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturingsources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing anadequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs andhave a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors topackage, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not havelong-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure servicesfrom these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacityconstraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences poweroutages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtainalternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Dueto the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we couldexperience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternativeassemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially andadversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to develop relationships withadditional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products. However, even if we usethese new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and thecomponents used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintainrelationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we haveadequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs,increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components, as wellas increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs.Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or solesupplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may notbe able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable tomeet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performanceor quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially andadversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials andcomponents for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review,we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter intoother sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While wedo not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currentlydependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductormanufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities. If we were to lose this sole source ofsupply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternatesource is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any ofour raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would beexacerbated.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lostone or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased itsorders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal year 2010, the Company had three customers, each with greater than ten percent of our net revenues: Samsung, Nokia and Foxconn.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate ourbusiness.17Table of ContentsAs the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent asignificant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivatequalified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management andother personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We mayhave particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operatingperformance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given among other things, the use ofequity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of ourkey employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have amaterial adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our seniormanagement team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team,none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period.The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategyand respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result insignificant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to sixmonths or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six monthsor more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycletime increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, whichcould reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, wemay incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrativeexpenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may nevergenerate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customercancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adverselyaffect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supplyarrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, wesell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsoldproducts if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimatesof customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may becompounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both,as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Inaddition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Thecancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, oroverproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess orobsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change indemand or for any other reason, the customers ability to make timely payments to us fornon-returnable products could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent usfrom using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assertpatent, copyright, trademark and other18Table of Contentsintellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demandedand may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringeintellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractualindemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly anddivert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of themerits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technicalissues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to resultin an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  pay substantial damages,   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,   discontinue the use of infringing technology,   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not beavailable on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one ofour customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were foundto be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customercould be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringingproduct(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand fromour customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, itcould have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses tosuch technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our businesscould be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasinglevels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtaintechnology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remaincompetitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms andconditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or our customersproducts could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances,we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitutetechnology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability tocompete.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as wellas nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietarytechnologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we oftenincorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into ourdesigns, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-partyintellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or likeactivities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or todetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. Thiscould require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of ourmanagement and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot be assured that:19Table of Contents  the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or otherviolation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,suppliers or other third parties will be successful,   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or otherintellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated orcircumvented, or   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around ourpatents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting inloss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not bebroad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patentprotection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection inforeign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protectionmay be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information throughoperational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former orcurrent employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without ourauthorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systemsor information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt ouroperations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate themethods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the UnitedStates, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we havesuppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and testfacilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subjectto a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limitedto, risks regarding:  currency exchange rate fluctuations, including changes in commodities prices related to suchfluctuations,   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and politicalinstability,   disruptions of capital and trading markets,   inability to collect accounts receivable,   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds andtrade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increasedimport or export controls and tariffs),   changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,   limitations on the repatriation of funds,   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,   cultural differences in the conduct of business,   the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade,foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,20Table of Contents  changes in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretationsthereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could adversely affectour results of operations,   our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective taxrate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries withdiffering statutory tax rates and the results of audits and examinations of previouslyfiled tax returns,   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce ourintellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators providesubsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negativelyimpact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which couldimpact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in SouthKorea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations areinsufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raiseadditional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital marketconditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raisesufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). Failure to obtain capitalwhen required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow ourbusiness may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investmentsand acquisitions may not be available in the future.Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.On October 1, 2010, we had total indebtedness of approximately $74.7 million, which representedapproximately 5.4% of our total capitalization. As of October 1, 2010, we have short-term debt of$50.0 million under  the  credit facility with Wells FargoBank, N.A. (the CreditFacility). Our ability to borrow under the Credit Facilityexpired in October 2010 and, given our strong cash position,management has determined that the Credit Facility is no longerrequired and accordingly, has been substantially repaid  as of November 29, 2010.  Also as of October 1, 2010, wehave long-term debt obligations of $26.7 million in aggregate principal value ($24.7 millioncarrying value) that mature in March 2012, which are described in more detail in Note 9 to Item 8of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may require additional financing prior to the maturity ofsuch debt.Our indebtedness could have negative consequences, including:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing,   requiring the dedication of a portion of any cash flow from operations toservice our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for otherpurposes,21Table of Contents  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in ourbusiness and the industry in which we compete, and   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitorsand competitors that have better access to capital resources.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometryprocess technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products toincreasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processesfor our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existingproducts. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry processtechnologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields,delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays andexpenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. Insome instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometryprocesses successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or wemay not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experiencesignificant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greaterlevels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into ourproducts. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver newintegrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign ourexisting products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produceour products.The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number ofdomestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number ofwhich have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European UnionRestriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive nowrequires that certain substances which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in thepast, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from ourmanufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds toseek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties toensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we haveimplemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there maybe instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or mayonly be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than theirrestricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule orregulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by governmentagencies that could adversely affect our operating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which couldadversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturingoperations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmentalprotection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulationof the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties tofund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it isoften difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potentialliabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating tocompliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures thatmight be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and tocontinue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.22Table of ContentsOur gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices andcomponents, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenideintegrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differentialis due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated withsmaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offergallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.Although we manufacture and sell silicon-based power amplifiers, if we do not continue to offerGaAs products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, ouroperating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect the costs of producinggallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon counterparts.Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integratedcircuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. We may not continue toidentify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions.To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integratecompanies we acquire.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources ininternal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changesand the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us topursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we reviewinvestment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augmentour market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify andconsummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, ifsuch transactions are consummated, they could result in:  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,   large, one-time write-offs,   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,   amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and   the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees andcustomers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, witha charge against earnings.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult forsomeone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate ofincorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions thatwould make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by ourBoard of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:  the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on astaggered basis, one class each year,   the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in oneor more series without further authorization of stockholders,23Table of Contents  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,   elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,   a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholdernominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at anymeeting of stockholders,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percentof our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or theprovision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relatingto the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act bywritten consent,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of theBoard of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combinationis the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Boardof Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial ownerof 5% or more of our shares,   a fair price provision, and   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following thetime that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directorsthen in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements aremet"

RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other informationcontained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial conditionor results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or otherfactors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also mayimpair our business operations, financial condition or results from operations.11Table of ContentsWe operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subjectto significant downturns.We operate primarily in the wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is cyclical andsubject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprisemarkets. Recently, weak and uncertain economic conditions worldwide, together with other factorssuch as the continued volatility of the financial markets, have made it difficult for our customersand for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. If such uncertainty andeconomic weakness continues, the market for wireless communications semiconductor products couldfurther contract and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations forour current fiscal year would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods ofindustry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, manufacturing overcapacity,excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Furthermore, downturnsin the wireless communications semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay orfailure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn would materiallyand adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our currentfiscal year.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuationsand market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated substantially on a quarterly andannual basis in the past and our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate inthe future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond ourcontrol.These factors include, among others:  changes in end-user demand for the products (principally cellular handsets)manufactured and sold by our customers,   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling pricesof our products,   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,   availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,   the gain or loss of significant customers,   our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timelybasis,   new product and technology introductions by competitors,   changes in the mix of products produced and sold,   market acceptance of our products and our customers,   our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-coreintellectual property, and   intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associatedwith the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, couldmaterially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating resultsfail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affectthe price of our common stock.12Table of ContentsOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Suchfluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:  the recent unprecedented volatility of the financial markets,   uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,   our performance and prospects,   the performance and prospects of our major customers,   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, and   domestic and international political conditions.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. Thisvolatility has significantly and negatively affected the market prices of securities of manytechnology companies, including the market price of our common stock. These broad marketfluctuations may further materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock infuture periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our tradingmultiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shiftfunds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Ourcompany has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Suchcommentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meetthe expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price maydecline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.The wireless communications semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competitionwhich may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and maymaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we competein particular are very competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductormanufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including RF Micro Devices andAvago.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and productcompetition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to resultin, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining orincreasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result ofgrowth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreignand domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principalcompetitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:  rapid time-to-market and product ramp,   timely new product innovation,   product quality, reliability and performance,   product price,13Table of Contents  features available in products,   compliance with industry standards,   strategic relationships with customers,   access to and protection of intellectual property, and   maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy thebenefit of:  long presence in key markets,   brand recognition,   high levels of customer satisfaction,   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical orother resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to thedevelopment, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial orstrategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. Theserelationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that newcompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant marketshare. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors.Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of marketshare and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets intowhich we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapidtechnological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards,short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increasedminiaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Ouroperating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new andenhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization ofsemiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:  the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes intechnology and industry standards,   the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand,   the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,   the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on atimely basis,   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,   overall market acceptance of our products,14Table of Contents  the length of time that a particular product is in demand, and   the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among otherfactors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or ITSystems.We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and tochoose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We maynot be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor productsin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements orachieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards andtechnological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcementsand introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementaryproducts of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly andcost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet ourcustomers requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adverselyharmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Ourproducts may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allowus to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe thatto remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existingproducts at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not beable to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive.If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do notdesign our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of otherproducts. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products toselect our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Withoutthese design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designsanother suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after adesign win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time toreduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commerciallysuccessful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convertdesign wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect ouroperating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyondour control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise processconsisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, cleanenvironment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step ofthe fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects inequipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantialpercentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because ouroperating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits atacceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness. In addition, although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, wemay discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may berequired to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty andindemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilitiesassociated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped atsignificant amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resourcesfrom other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers orothers, including liability for costs associated with product15Table of Contentsrecalls, or other obligations under customer contracts, which may adversely impact our operatingresults. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibilityproblems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell ourproducts to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations atany of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result fromelectrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories orrisks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/orupgrades such as the conversion to a 6 wafer manufacturing line currently in process at ourNewbury Park, California facility. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could causesignificant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facilityor subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, the requiredalternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timelybasis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available,we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or aloss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand,either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturingprocess, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusettssemiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide productioncapacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to ourgross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturingyield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for newproducts initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volumemanufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forwardproduct pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect onour gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yieldsand maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to bemagnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Ourmanufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product lifecycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods whilemaintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching thelonger-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and decliningcosts.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-basedproducts and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significantrisks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:  the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and qualityassurance, and   the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturingcapacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the productionrequirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take anextended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping productsfrom the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliverproducts to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularlysince some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacityoccurs, we may not16Table of Contentshave alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experiencedifficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair ourability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors topackage, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not havelong-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure servicesfrom these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacityconstraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences poweroutages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtainalternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Dueto the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we couldexperience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternativeassemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially andadversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to develop relationships withadditional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products. However, even if we usethese new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and thecomponents used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintainrelationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we haveadequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs,increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components canresult in tighter supplies. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we maylose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and qualityspecifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplierwere unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customerobligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationshipswith suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. Inconnection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or moresuppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our rawmaterial or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for ourraw materials, we are currently dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used inthe gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities. If wewere to lose this sole source of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our businesscould result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional solesupplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with oursupply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lostone or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased itsorders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Sales to ourthree largest OEM/distribution customers in fiscal 2009, Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Ericsson MobileCommunication AB (SEMC), and Asian Information Technology, Inc. (AIT), including sales to theirmanufacturing subcontractors (in the case of SEMC and Samsung), represented approximately 38% ofour net revenues for fiscal 2009.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate ourbusiness.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent asignificant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivatequalified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management andother personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and17Table of Contentssale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnelduring periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock,given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The lossof the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain andmotivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate ourbusiness.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result insignificant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to sixmonths or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six monthsor more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycletime increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, whichcould reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, wemay incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrativeexpenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may nevergenerate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customercancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adverselyaffect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supplyarrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, wesell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsoldproducts if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimatesof customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may becompounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both,as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Inaddition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Thecancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, oroverproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess orobsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change indemand or for any other reason, the customers ability to make timely payments to us fornon-returnable products could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent usfrom using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assertpatent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license theirtechnology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringeintellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractualindemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly anddivert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of themerits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technicalissues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to resultin an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  pay substantial damages,   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,   discontinue the use of infringing technology,18Table of Contents  expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not beavailable on commercially reasonable terms.Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one ofour customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were foundto be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customercould be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringingproduct(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand fromour customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, itcould have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses tosuch technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our businesscould be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasinglevels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtaintechnology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remaincompetitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms andconditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or our customersproducts could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances,we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitutetechnology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability tocompete.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as wellas nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietarytechnologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we oftenincorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into ourdesigns, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-partyintellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or likeactivities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or todetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. Thiscould require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of ourmanagement and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot be assured that:  the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or otherviolation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,suppliers or other third parties will be successful,   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or otherintellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated orcircumvented, or   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around ourpatents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting inloss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not bebroad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receivepatent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protectionin foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secretprotection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.19Table of ContentsWe attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information throughoperational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former orcurrent employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without ourauthorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systemsor information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt ouroperations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate themethods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the UnitedStates, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we havesuppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and testfacilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subjectto a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limitedto, risks regarding:  currency exchange rate fluctuations,   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and politicalinstability,   disruptions of capital and trading markets,   inability to collect accounts receivable,   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds andtrade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties,increased import or export controls and tariffs),   changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,   limitations on the repatriation of funds,   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,   cultural differences in the conduct of business,   the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade,foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,   tax laws,   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce ourintellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators providesubsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negativelyimpact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which couldimpact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in SouthKorea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.20Table of ContentsWe face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations areinsufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raiseadditional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital marketconditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raisesufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). Failure to obtain capitalwhen required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow ourbusiness may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investmentsand acquisitions may not be available in the future.Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.On October 2, 2009, we had total indebtedness of approximately $129.7 million, which representedapproximately 10.5% of our total capitalization. Although our cash and cash equivalents balancecurrently exceeds our total indebtedness, we have long-term debt obligations that mature in 2012,and we may require additional financing prior to the maturity of such debt in order to allow us tosufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capitaland other cash requirements, particularly if our short-term revolving credit facility were notrenewed.Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing,   requiring the dedication of a portion of any cash flow from operations toservice our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for otherpurposes,   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in ourbusiness and the industry in which we compete, and   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitorsand competitors that have better access to capital resources.Despite our current debt levels, we believe we are able to incur substantially more debt, whichwould increase the risks described above.We have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.In the past, weak global economic conditions have led to a slowdown in customer orders, an increasein the number of cancellations and rescheduling of backlog, and higher overhead costs as apercentage of our reduced net revenue. These factors contributed to operating losses for ourbusiness in the past. While we had positive operating results during the last three fiscal years,we may experience future losses as a result of a significant downturn in the economy, as a resultof corporate restructuring activities, as a result of market factors beyond our control, or as aresult of a combination of the foregoing.Accounting Rule Changes for Certain Convertible Debt Instruments Will Alter Trends Established inPrevious Periods.In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 470-20-Debt, Debt withConversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20). On October 3, 2009, we will adopt ASC 470-20. ThisTopic alters the21Table of Contentsaccounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for eithermandatory or optional cash settlements.Specifically, it will significantly increase the non-cash interest expense associated with ourexisting 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes, and previously held 4.75% convertible notes includinginterest expense in prior periods. This accounting guidance will result in significantly highernon-cash interest expense in fiscal year 2010 and beyond, as well as non-cash interest expense inprior periods which has yet to be determined.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometryprocess technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products toincreasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processesfor our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existingproducts. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry processtechnologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields,delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays andexpenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. Insome instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometryprocesses successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or wemay not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experiencesignificant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greaterlevels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into ourproducts. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver newintegrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign ourexisting products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produceour products.The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number ofdomestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number ofwhich have been used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction ofHazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires thatcertain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requiresthe expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, aswell as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliancewith the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our productoffering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not beavailable or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may besignificantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found tobe non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/orrestrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which couldadversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturingoperations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmentalprotection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulationof the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties tofund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it isoften difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potentialliabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating tocompliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures thatmight be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and tocontinue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.22Table of ContentsOur gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices andcomponents, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenideintegrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differentialis due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated withsmaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offergallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justifythe cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expectthe costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producingtheir silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologiesfor certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. We maynot continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of galliumarsenide solutions.To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integratecompanies we acquire.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources ininternal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changesand the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us topursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we reviewinvestment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augmentour market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify andconsummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, ifsuch transactions are consummated, they could result in:  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,   large, one-time write-offs,   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,   amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and   the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees andcustomers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, witha charge against earnings.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult forsomeone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate ofincorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions thatwould make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by ourBoard of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:  the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on astaggered basis, one class each year,   the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in oneor more series without further authorization of stockholders,23Table of Contents  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,   elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,   a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholdernominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at anymeeting of stockholders,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent of ourshares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision ofour certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relatingto the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act bywritten consent,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of theBoard of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combinationis the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Boardof Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial ownerof 5% or more of our shares,   a fair price provision, and   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following thetime that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directorsthen in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements aremet"

RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making aninvestment decision.  Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmedby any of these risks.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones weface.  Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us topresent significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations,financial condition or results from operations.We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subjectto significant downturns.We operate primarily in the wirelesssemiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-userproducts in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Recently, deteriorating economic conditionsworldwide, together with other factors such as the unprecedented volatility of the financialmarkets and liquidity concerns, make it difficult for our customers and for us to accuratelyforecast and plan future business activities. If such uncertainty and economic weaknesscontinues, the market for wireless semiconductor products is likely to contract and, asa result, our business, financial condition and results of operations for our currentfiscal year would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industrydownturn are characterized by diminished product demand, manufacturing overcapacity,excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Furthermore,downturns in the wireless semiconductor industry may be prolonged and any extended delayor failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn wouldmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operationsbeyond our current fiscal year.12Table of ContentsWe have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.In the past, weak global economic conditions have led to a slowdown in customer orders, an increasein the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog, and higher overhead costs as apercentage of our reduced net revenue. These factors contributed to operating losses for ourbusiness in the past. Additionally, we have incurred operating losses in connection with therestructuring of our business; for example, we had operating losses of $66.3 million during fiscalyear 2006 in connection with the exit of our baseband product area. While we had positiveoperating results during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, we may experience future losses as a result ofa significant downturn in the economy, as a result of corporate restructuring activities, as aresult of market factors beyond our control or as a result of a combination of the foregoing.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuationsand market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues,earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to anumber of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:  changes in end-user demand for the products (principally cellular handsets) manufacturedand sold by our customers,   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling pricesof our products,   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,   availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,   the gain or loss of significant customers,   our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timelybasis,   new product and technology introductions by competitors,   changes in the mix of products produced and sold,   market acceptance of our products and our customers,   our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or selling non-coreintellectual property, and   intellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associatedwith the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, couldmaterially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating resultsfail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affectthe price of our common stock.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Suchfluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:13Table of Contents  the recent unprecedented volatility of the financial markets,   uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,   our performance and prospects,   the performance and prospects of our major customers,   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, and   domestic and international political conditions.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. Thisvolatility has significantly and negatively affected the marketprices of securities of many technology companies, including themarket price of our common stock.These broad market fluctuations may further materially and adversely affect the market price of our commonstock in future periods.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our tradingmultiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shiftfunds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. OurCompany has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Suchcommentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meetthe expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possiblysubstantially over a short period of time.The wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may causepricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we competein particular are very competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductormanufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including RF Micro Devices,Anadigics and TriQuint Semiconductor. As we continue to expand in the linear products markets, wewill compete with companies in other industries, including Analog Devices, Hittite Microwave,Linear Technology and Maxim Integrated Products.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and productcompetition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to resultin, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining orincreasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result ofgrowth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreignand domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principalcompetitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:  rapid time-to-market and product ramp,   timely new product innovation,   product quality, reliability and performance,   product price,   features available in products,   compliance with industry standards,14Table of Contents  strategic relationships with customers,   access to and protection of intellectual property, and   maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy thebenefit of:  long presence in key markets,  brand recognition,   high levels of customer satisfaction,   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical orother resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to thedevelopment, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial orstrategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. Theserelationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that newcompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant marketshare. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current andpotential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased grossmargins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets intowhich we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapidtechnological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards,short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increasedminiaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Ouroperating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new andenhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization ofsemiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:  the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes intechnology and industry standards,   the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand,   the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,   the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on atimely basis,   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,   overall market acceptance of our products,   the length of time that a particular product is in demand, and   the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.15Table of ContentsOur ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among otherfactors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or ITSystems.We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned productdevelopment and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future marketgrowth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wirelesscommunications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products willsatisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipatenew industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able torespond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes inthe design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our productsinterface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products insufficient quantities that meet our customers requirements, our business and results ofoperations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We cannotassure you that our products will not become obsolete earlier than planned or have life cycles longenough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly,we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing anddelivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhancedproducts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our productsto remain competitive.If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do notdesign our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of otherproducts. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products toselect our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Withoutthese design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designsanother suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after adesign win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time toreduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commerciallysuccessful, or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve designwins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and any failure to do so could materially andadversely affect our operating results.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including for causes beyond ourcontrol. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise processconsisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, cleanenvironment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step ofthe fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects inequipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantialpercentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because ouroperating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits atacceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness. In addition, although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, wemay discover from time to time defects in our products after theyhave been shipped, and we may be requiredto incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnificationprovisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated withthese, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at significantamounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from otherproduct development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others,including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other16Table of Contentsobligations under customercontracts, which may adversely impact our operating results. If any of our products containdefects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged,which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospectivecustomers and could adversely affect our operating results.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations atany of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result fromelectrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories orrisks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/orupgrades such as the conversion to a 6 wafer manufacturing line currently in process at ourNewbury Park, California facility. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could causesignificant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facilityor subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, we cannotassure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, would beavailable on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assembly and testcapacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result inhigher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturingcapacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similararrangements with others.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturingprocess, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusettssemiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide productioncapacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to ourgross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturingyield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for newproducts initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volumemanufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forwardproduct pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect onour gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yieldsand maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to bemagnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Ourmanufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product lifecycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods whilemaintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching thelonger-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and decliningcosts.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-basedproducts and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significantrisks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:  the lack of  wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and qualityassurance, and   the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturingcapacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the productionrequirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take anextended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping productsfrom the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliverproducts to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly17Table of Contentssince some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacityoccurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may thereforeexperience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which couldimpair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors topackage, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any ofour assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a perorder basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financialdifficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any otherdisruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly andtesting services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualifyassemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we arerequired to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we mayencounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customerrelationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing todevelop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of therisks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and thecomponents used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintainrelationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we haveadequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs,increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components canresult in tighter supplies. We cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet ourdelivery schedules, that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier, that a supplier will beable to meet performance and quality specifications or that we will be able to purchase suchsupplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our deliveryschedules, or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or qualityspecifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adverselyaffected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and componentsfor our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we maymodify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into other solesupplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do nottypically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on asole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturingprocesses at our manufacturing facilities. If we were to lose this sole source of supply, for anyreason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source isobtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our rawmaterials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If welost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantlydecreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.Sales to our three largest OEM customers in fiscal 2008, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication AB(SEMC), Samsung, and Asian Information Technology, Inc. (AIT), including sales to theirmanufacturing subcontractors (in the case of SEMC and Samsung), represented approximately 40% ofour net revenues for fiscal 2008.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate ourbusiness.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent asignificant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivatequalified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,and therefore we cannot assure18Table of Contentsyou thatwe will be able to attract and retain qualified managementand other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. Wemay have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of pooroperating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock given, among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us andour competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability toattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on ourability to operate our business.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result insignificant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to sixmonths or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six monthsor more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycletime increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, whichcould reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, wemay incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrativeexpenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may nevergenerate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customercancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adverselyaffect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supplyarrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, wesell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsoldproducts if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimatesof customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may becompounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both,as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Inaddition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Thecancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, oroverproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess orobsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change indemand or for any other reason, the customers ability to make timely payments to us fornon-returnable products could be impaired.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent usfrom using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assertpatent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license theirtechnology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringeintellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractualindemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly anddivert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of themerits of any specific claim, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because ofthe complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Iflitigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  pay substantial damages,   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,   discontinue the use of infringing technology,19Table of Contents  expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not beavailable on commercially reasonable terms.We cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materiallyadversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to do any one or more of theforegoing items.In addition, if another supplier to one ofour customers, or a customer of ours itself, were foundto be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customercould be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringingproduct(s) or process (es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand fromour customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, itcould have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses tosuch technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our businesscould be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterizedby rapid technological changes, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasinglevels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtaintechnology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remaincompetitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms andconditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or our customersproducts could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances,we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitutetechnology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability tocompete.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as wellas nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietarytechnologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we oftenincorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into ourdesigns, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-partyintellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or likeactivities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or todetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. Thiscould require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of ourmanagement and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that:  the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or otherviolation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,suppliers or other third parties will be successful,   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or otherintellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated orcircumvented, or   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around ourpatents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting inloss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not bebroad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patentprotection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection inforeign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protectionmay be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.20Table of ContentsWe attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information throughoperational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former orcurrent employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without ourauthorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systemsor information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt ouroperations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate themethods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the UnitedStates, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we havesuppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and testfacilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subjectto a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limitedto, risks regarding:  currency exchange rate fluctuations,   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and politicalinstability,   disruptions of capital and trading markets,   inability to collect accounts receivable,   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds andtrade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, increased importor export controls and tariffs),  changes in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements,   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,   limitations on the repatriation of funds,   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,   cultural differences in the conduct of business,  the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade,foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,   tax laws,   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce ourintellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators providesubsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impacthandset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impactthe demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.21Table of ContentsWe face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and cashequivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficientto fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additionalfunds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditionsexist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficientcapital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstanceswould have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow ourbusiness may require additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital requiredto fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.On October 3, 2008, we had total indebtedness ofapproximately $187.6 million, which representedapproximately 17.3% of our total capitalization. After the close of fiscal year 2008, we retired $40.5 million inaggregate principal amount of our 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes. Although our cash andcash equivalents balance currently exceeds our total indebtedness, we have long term debt obligations thatmature in 2010 and 2012, and we may require additional financing prior to such dates in order toallow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, workingcapital and other cash requirements, particularly if ourshort-term revolving credit facility were not renewed.Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing,   requiring the dedication of a portion of any cash flow from operations toservice our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for otherpurposes,   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in ourbusiness and the industry in which we compete, and   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitorsand competitors that have better access to capital resources.Despite our current debt levels, we believe we are able to incursubstantially more debt, which would increasethe risks described above.AccountingRule Changes for Certain Convertible Debt Instruments Will Alter Trends Established inPrevious PeriodsIn May, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May be Settled in Cash uponConversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). This FSP alters the accounting treatment forconvertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements.Specifically, it will significantly increase the non-cash interest expense associated with ourexisting 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes, and previously held 4.75% convertible notes including interest expense inprior periods. The exact impact of this proposal to the Companys financial statements is currentlybeing evaluated. The Company is not required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 until the first quarter offiscal 2010.22Table of ContentsRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometryprocess technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products toincreasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processesfor our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existingproducts. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry processtechnologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields,delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similardifficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometryprocesses in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries totransition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries willbe able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundryrelationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail toefficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, weexpect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and thirdparty intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higherlevels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign ourexisting products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produceour products.The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number ofdomestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number ofwhich have been used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction ofHazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires thatcertain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requiresthe expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, aswell as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliancewith the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our productoffering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not beavailable or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may besignificantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found tobe non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/orrestrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which couldadversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturingoperations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmentalprotection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. We cannot assure you thatcurrent or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmentalregulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulationsregardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact ofenvironmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasinglyrequire warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. We cannotassure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfyenvironmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicableenvironmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices andcomponents, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenideintegrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differentialis due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated withsmaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain23Table of Contentscompetitive, we must offergallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justifythe cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expectthe costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producingtheir silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologiesfor certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. Wecannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performanceattributes of gallium arsenide solutions.To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integratecompanies we acquire.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources ininternal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changesand the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us topursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we reviewinvestment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augmentour market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisitiontransactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in:  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,   large, one-time write-offs,   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,   amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and   the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees andcustomers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, witha charge against earnings.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult forsomeone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate ofincorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions thatwould make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by ourBoard of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:  the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on astaggered basis, one class each year,   the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in oneor more series without further authorization of stockholders,   a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,   elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,24Table of Contents  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholdernominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at anymeeting of stockholders,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent of ourshares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision ofour certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relatingto the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act bywritten consent,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares beobtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of theBoard of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combinationis the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Boardof Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial ownerof 5% or more of our shares,   a fair price provision, and   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares beobtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following thetime that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directorsthen in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements aremet"
14,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2007-11-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSCERTAIN BUSINESS RISKSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, many of which arebeyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks, which may affect our futureoperating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you toconsider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deemimmaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business ingeneral, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertaintiesactually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subjectto significant downturns.We operate primarily in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid changeand evolving industry standards. From time to time, changes in general economic conditions,together with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry. Periods ofindustry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, excessinventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These characteristics, and inparticular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets, may cause substantialfluctuations in our revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductorindustry may be severe and prolonged, and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or thewireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. The semiconductor industry alsoperiodically experiences increased demand and production capacity and materials constraints, whichmay affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We have experienced these cyclicalfluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future.We have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.In the past, global economic conditions led to a slowdown in customer orders, an increase in thenumber of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog, higher overhead costs as a percentage of ourreduced net revenue, and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end-user products thatincorporate our wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions. These factors,contributed to operating losses for our business in the past. Additionally, we have incurredoperating losses in connection with the restructuring of our business; for example, we hadoperating losses of $66.3 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the exit of ourbaseband product area.While we had positive operating results during fiscal year 2007, we may experience future losses asa result of downturns in the economy, as a result of corporate restructuring activities or as aresult of market factors beyond our control.Additionally, the conflict in Iraq, as well as other contemporary international conflicts, naturaldisasters, acts of terrorism, and civil and military unrest contributes to the economicuncertainty. These continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to placecontinued pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions makeit extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and planfuture business activities. If such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen (or both),our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adverselyaffected.13Table of ContentsThe wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may causepricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we competein particular are very competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductormanufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including RF Micro Devices,Anadigics and TriQuint Semiconductor. As we expand in the linear products market, we will competewith companies in other industries, including Analog Devices, Hittite Microwave, Linear Technologyand Maxim Integrated Products.We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and productcompetition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to resultin, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining orincreasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result ofgrowth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreignand domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principalcompetitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:  rapid time-to-market and product ramp,   timely new product innovation,   product quality, reliability and performance,   product price,   features available in products,   compliance with industry standards,   strategic relationships with customers, and   access to and protection of intellectual property.We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy thebenefit of:  long presence in key markets,   name recognition,   high levels of customer satisfaction,   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical orother resources.As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to thedevelopment, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish, financial orstrategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. Theserelationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that newcompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant marketshare. Furthermore, some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufactureproducts similar to ours, and may compete with us. We cannot assure you that we will be able tocompete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could resultin pricing14Table of Contentspressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affectour business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including for causes beyond ourcontrol. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise processconsisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, cleanenvironment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step ofthe fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects inequipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantialpercentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because ouroperating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits atacceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness. In addition, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they havebeen shipped, which may require us to pay warranty claims, replace products, or pay costsassociated with the recall of a customers products containing our parts.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations atany of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result fromelectrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories orrisks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/orupgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations couldcause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affectedfacility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, wecannot assure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity,would be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assemblyand test capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which couldresult in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficientmanufacturing capacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or through externalmanufacturing or similar arrangements with others.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturingprocess, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusettssemiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity wouldnot be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to ourgross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturingyield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for newproducts initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volumemanufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forwardproduct pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect onour gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yieldsand maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to bemagnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Ourmanufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product lifecycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods whilemaintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching thelonger-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and decliningcosts.We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-basedproducts and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significantrisks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including: the lack of ensured wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,15Table of Contents limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and qualityassurance, and the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturingcapacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the productionrequirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take anextended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping productsfrom the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliverproducts to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularlysince some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacityoccurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may thereforeexperience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which couldimpair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors topackage, assemble and test certain of our products. We do not have long-term agreements with any ofour assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a perorder basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financialdifficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any otherdisruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly andtesting services in a timely manner. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualifyassemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we arerequired to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we mayencounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customerrelationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing todevelop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of therisks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and thecomponents used in our manufacturing processes. Although we maintain relationships with supplierslocated around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for thesupply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, recent increased demand fromthe semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components has resulted in tighter supplies.We cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our delivery schedules, that we willnot lose a significant or sole supplier, or that a supplier will be able to meet performance andquality specifications. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, or if we lost asupplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability tosatisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review ourrelationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on anongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationshipwith one or more suppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certainof our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supplyfor our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafersused in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities.If we were to lose this sole source of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on ourbusiness could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additionalsole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated withour supply arrangements would be exacerbated.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If welost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantlydecreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.Sales to our three largest OEM customers in fiscal 2007, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication AB,Motorola, Inc., and Samsung, including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors, representedapproximately 50% of our net revenues for fiscal 2007. Although we expect that our16Table of Contentslargest OEM customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues infiscal 2008, a large customer of ours recently experienced reduced demand for its products. Asustained decrease in orders from this customer could materially and adversely affect our resultsfrom operations.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets intowhich we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapidtechnological change, rapid product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, shortproduct life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization,and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on ourability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. Thesuccessful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complexand depends on numerous factors, including: the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology andindustry standards, the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand, the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements, the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timelybasis, the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors, overall market acceptance of our products, and the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among otherfactors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or ITSystems.We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment inresearch and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in atimely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned productdevelopment and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future marketgrowth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wirelesscommunications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products willsatisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipatenew industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able torespond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes inthe design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our productsinterface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products insufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements, our business and results ofoperations would be materially and adversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We believethat to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and deliveringexisting products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. Wecannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remaincompetitive.The markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change. If weare not able to adapt to changes, our products may become obsolete.The demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate. Our marketsgenerally exhibit the following characteristics: rapid technological developments and product evolution,17Table of Contents rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size and decreased power consumption, short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product, and evolving industry standards.These changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products. Our products couldbecome obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipatedchange in one or more of the above-noted factors.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate ourbusiness.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent asignificant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivatequalified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified managementand other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. Wemay have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of pooroperating performance, given, among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us andour competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability toattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on ourability to operate our business.If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do notdesign our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of otherproducts. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products toselect our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Withoutthese design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designsanother suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after adesign win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time toreduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commerciallysuccessful, or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve designwins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and any failure to do so could materially andadversely affect our operating results.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result insignificant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to sixmonths or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six monthsor more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycletime increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, whichcould reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, wemay incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrativeexpenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may nevergenerate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customercancels or changes its product plans.18Table of ContentsUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adverselyaffect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supplyarrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, wesell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsoldproducts. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for ourproducts, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMsindirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand willthen be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may changetheir inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of productorders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipatedorder volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result ininventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change indemand or for any other reason, the customers ability to make timely payments to us fornon-returnable products could be impaired.Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.On September 28, 2007, we had total indebtedness of approximately $299.3 million, which representedapproximately 30.3% of our total capitalization. We retired the remaining $49.3 million in aggregate principalamount of the Junior Notes plus $1.2 millionin accrued and unpaid interest on the due date of November 15, 2007.We may require additional funding prior to the date that we expect our existing sources ofliquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments,to allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions,debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements. If necessary,among other alternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and wemay obtain other long-term debt, lines of credit and other financing.Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations toservice our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes,including capital expenditures, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and theindustry in which we compete, and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors andcompetitors that have better access to capital resources.Despite our current debt levels, we are able to incur substantially more debt, which would increasethe risks described above.Proposed Accounting Rule Changes for Certain Convertible Debt Instruments Could Alter TrendsEstablished in Previous PeriodsOn August 31, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued proposed FSP APB 14-a for a 45-day comment period that ended on October 15,2007 that if adopted, would alter the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory oroptional cash settlements.19Table of ContentsSpecifically, it could significantly increase the non-cash interest expenseassociated with our existing $200 million 2007 Convertible Notes including interest expense inprior periods. The exact impact of this proposal to the Companys financial statements will not beknown until such time that the proposal is finalized.Average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short. If we are unableto sell our products at an acceptable price, or at all, our operating results would be harmed.In the semiconductor industry, product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales anddevelopment cycles. Therefore, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not resultin material revenue, and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory.If we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are notable to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results wouldbe materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices inanticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operatingresults would be harmed.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.To the extent that our existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient tofund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional fundsthrough public or private equity or debt financing. Conditions existing in the U.S. capitalmarkets, if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of theCompany, will affect our ability to raise capital, as well as the terms of any such financing. Wemay not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all.Failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow ourbusiness may require additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital requiredto fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometryprocess technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products toincreasingly smaller line width geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturingprocesses for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign someexisting products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometryprocess technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturingyields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties,delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in thefuture. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition tosmaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able toeffectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships. Ifour foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficientlyimplement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could bematerially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expectto continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third partyintellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels ofdesign integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the UnitedStates, primarily countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we havesuppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and testfacilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subjectto a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limitedto, risks regarding: currency exchange rate fluctuations,20Table of Contents local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and politicalinstability, disruptions of capital and trading markets, inability to collect accounts receivable, restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and tradeprotection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, import or export controls andtariffs), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war, limitations on the repatriation of funds, difficulty in obtaining distribution and support, cultural differences in the conduct of business, the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreigninvestment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements, tax laws, the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual propertyrights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators providesubsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impacthandset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impactthe demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuationsand market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues,earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to anumber of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others: changes in end-user demand for the products (principally digital cellular handsets)manufactured and sold by our customers, the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling pricesof our products, production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields, availability and cost of products from our suppliers, the gain or loss of significant customers,21Table of Contents our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timelybasis, new product and technology introductions by competitors, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, market acceptance of our products and our customers, and intellectual property disputes our ability to continue to generate revenues by licensing and/or sellingnon-core intellectual property.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, couldmaterially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating resultsfail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affectthe price of our common stock.Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices andcomponents, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenideintegrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differentialis due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated withsmaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offergallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justifythe cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expectthe costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producingtheir silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologiesfor certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. Wecannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performanceattributes of gallium arsenide solutions.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent usfrom using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assertpatent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license theirtechnology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringeintellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractualindemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly anddivert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of themerits of any specific claim, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because ofthe complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Iflitigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  pay substantial damages,   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,   discontinue the use of infringing technology,   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.22Table of ContentsWe cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materiallyadversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to do any one or more of theforegoing items.In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were foundto be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customercould be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringingproduct(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand fromour customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, itcould have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses tosuch technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our businesscould be adversely affected.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes; evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasinglevels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtaintechnology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in acompetitive posture. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonableterms and conditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or ourcustomers products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In suchinstances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to developsubstitute technology to deliver competitive products.If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability tocompete.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as wellas nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietarytechnologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we oftenincorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into ourdesigns, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-partyintellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or likeactivities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or todetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. Thiscould require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of ourmanagement and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that: the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation ofour intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other thirdparties will be successful, any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectualproperty rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around ourpatents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting inloss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not bebroad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patentprotection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection inforeign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protectionmay be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.There is a growing industry trend to include or adapt open source software that is generally madeavailable to the public by its developers, authors or third parties. Often such software includeslicense provisions, requiring public23Table of Contentsdisclosure of any derivative works containing open source code. There is little legal precedent in the area of opensource software or its effects on copyright law or the protection of proprietary works. We takesteps to avoid the use of open source works in our proprietary software, and are taking steps tolimit our suppliers from doing so. However, in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate incourt that we have not complied with a software license, we may be required to cease production ordistribution of that work or to publicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software,which may negatively affect our operations or stock price.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information throughoperational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former orcurrent employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without ourauthorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systemsor information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt ouroperations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate themethods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integratecompanies we acquire.Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources ininternal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changesand the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us topursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we reviewinvestment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augmentour market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisitiontransactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in: issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders, large, one-time write-offs, the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities, the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees andcustomers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, witha charge against earnings.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult forsomeoneto acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate ofincorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions thatwould make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by ourBoard of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as: the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a staggeredbasis, one class each year, the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or moreseries without further authorization of stockholders,24Table of Contents a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders, a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations ofdirectors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders, a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent of our shares be obtainedto amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of our certificate ofincorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws, a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amendor repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removalof directors, the classified board or the right to act by written consent, a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained forbusiness combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and,in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or moreof our shares, a majority of the members of Board of Directors in office prior to the time suchother party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a fair price provision, and a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amendor repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following thetime that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directorsthen in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements aremet.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign ourexisting products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produceour products.The semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmentalregulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of varioussubstances, a number of which have been used in our products or processes. For example, theEuropean Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS)Directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removingsuch substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seekalternative substances, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of ourproducts and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program toensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternativesubstances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a singlesource, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, ifwe were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines,penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect ouroperating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which couldadversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturingoperations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmentalprotection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. We cannot assure you thatcurrent or future regulation of the materials necessary for25Table of Contentsour products would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of suchregulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impactof environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasinglyrequire warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. We cannotassure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfyenvironmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicableenvironmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, the price of ournotes may fluctuate.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Suchfluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including: our performance and prospects, the performance and prospects of our major customers, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate, changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts, general financial and other market conditions, and domestic and international economic conditions.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility,particularly in the technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affectedthe market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to ordisproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies. These broad marketfluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and our price-to-earningsmultiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who oftenshift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction,particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Our Company has been, and in the future may be, thesubject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in ourstock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts orinvestors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time"
17,SWKS,SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC,2006-12-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSCERTAIN BUSINESS RISKSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, many of which arebeyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks, which may affect our futureoperating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you toconsider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deemimmaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business ingeneral, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertaintiesactually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subjectto significant downturns.We operate primarily in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid changeand evolving industry standards. From time to time, changes in general economic conditions,together with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry. Periods ofindustry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, excessinventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These characteristics, and inparticular their impact on the level of demand for digital cellular handsets, may cause substantialfluctuations in our revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductorindustry may be severe and prolonged, and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or thewireless communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. The semiconductor industry alsoperiodically experiences increased demand and production capacity and materials constraints, whichmay affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We have experienced these cyclicalfluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future.Uncertainties involving shifting marketplace dynamics.Our operating results for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 were adversely affected by shiftingmarketplace dynamics which favored Tier I and Tier II handset manufacturers and suppliers.Consolidation of the global handset marketplace from smaller Tier III handset customers primarilylocated in developing countries to Tier I and Tier II customers accelerated in fiscal 2006. Thistrend led to a slowdown in customer orders, increasing channel inventories and customer defaults onaccounts receivable. We responded to this rapidly changing dynamic by exiting our baseband productarea in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. While this marketplace shift only affected our basebandproduct area there can be no assurances that future changes in marketplace conditions in our otherproduct areas will not materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able torespond to shifting customer demand in other product areas on a timely basis, if at all, andaccordingly this could result in a material and adverse impact to our operating results.We have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.Our operating results for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were adversely affected by a global economicslowdown, decreased consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, and adverse business conditionsand liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries. These factors led to aslowdown in customer orders, an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings ofbacklog, higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue, and an abrupt decline indemand for many of the end-user products that incorporate our wireless communications semiconductorproducts and system solutions. Although we emerged from this period of economic12Table of Contentsweakness in fiscal 2004, should economic conditions deteriorate for any reason, it could result inunderutilization of our manufacturing capacity, reduced revenues or changes in our revenue mix, andother impacts that would materially and adversely affect our operating results. Due to thiseconomic uncertainty, although we were profitable in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, we cannot assureyou that we will be able to sustain such profitability or that we will not experience futureoperating losses.Additionally, the conflict in Iraq, as well as other contemporary international conflicts, naturaldisasters, acts of terrorism, and civil and military unrest contributes to the economicuncertainty. These continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to placecontinued pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions makeit extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and planfuture business activities. If such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen (or both),our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adverselyaffected.The wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by intense competition.The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we competein particular are intensely competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductormanufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share. We currently face significantcompetition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue.This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining averageselling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share.Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities incommunications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitorsand technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors forsemiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:  rapid time-to-market and product ramp,   timely new product innovation,   product quality, reliability and performance,   product price,   features available in products,   compliance with industry standards,   strategic relationships with customers, and   access to and protection of intellectual property.We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors. Many of ourcompetitors enjoy the benefit of:  long presence in key markets,   name recognition,   high levels of customer satisfaction,   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.13Table of ContentsAs a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to thedevelopment, promotion and sale of their products than we can.Current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish, financial orstrategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. Theserelationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that newcompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant marketshare. Furthermore, some of our customers have divisions that internally develop or manufactureproducts similar to ours, and may compete with us. We cannot assure you that we will be able tocompete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could resultin pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized.Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including for causes beyond ourcontrol. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise processconsisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, cleanenvironment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step ofthe fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects inequipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantialpercentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because ouroperating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits atacceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness. In addition, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they havebeen shipped, which may require us to pay warranty claims, replace products, or pay costsassociated with the recall of a customers products containing our parts.Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations atany of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may includeelectrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories orrisks, or other natural or man-made disasters. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations couldcause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affectedfacility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, wecannot assure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity,would be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assemblyand test capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which couldresult in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficientmanufacturing capacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or through externalmanufacturing or similar arrangements with others.Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturingprocess, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusettssemiconductor wafer fabrication facilities, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity wouldnot be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to ourgross margin and profitability.Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturingyield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for newproducts initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volumemanufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forwardproduct pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect onour gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yieldsand maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to bemagnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Ourmanufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product lifecycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods whilemaintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching thelonger-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and decliningcosts.14Table of ContentsWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-basedproducts and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significantrisks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:  the lack of ensured wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher waferprices,   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costsand quality assurance, and   the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key processtechnologies.Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturingcapacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the productionrequirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take anextended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping productsfrom the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliverproducts to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularlysince some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacityoccurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may thereforeexperience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which couldimpair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors topackage, assemble and test certain of our products. We do not have long-term agreements with anyof our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a perorder basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financialdifficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any otherdisruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly andtesting services in a timely manner. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualifyassemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we arerequired to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we mayencounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customerrelationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing todevelop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of therisks described above.We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and thecomponents used in our manufacturing processes. Although we maintain relationships with supplierslocated around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for thesupply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, recent increased demand fromthe semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components has resulted in tighter supplies.We cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our delivery schedules, that we willnot lose a significant or sole supplier, or that a supplier will be able to meet performance andquality specifications. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, or if we lost asupplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability tosatisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review ourrelationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on anongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationshipwith one or more suppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certainof our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supplyfor our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafersused in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities.If we were to lose this sole source of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on ourbusiness could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additionalsole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated withour supply arrangements would be exacerbated.15Table of ContentsChanges in the accounting treatment of share-based compensation have adversely affected our resultsof operations.In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-BasedPayment to require companies to expense employee stock options for financial reporting purposes.Such equity-based award expensing has required us to value our employee stock option grants andother equity-based awards pursuant to an option valuation formula and amortize that value againstour earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options. Historically we accounted forstock-based awards to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and had adopted the disclosure-only alternative of SFASNo. 123, Accounting for Share-Based Compensation. We implemented SFAS 123(R) in the reportingperiod starting October 1, 2005. This change in accounting treatment has materially affected ourreported results of operations as the share-based compensation expense has been and will continueto be charged directly against our reported earnings but will have no impact on cash flows fromoperations. We anticipate that our share-based compensation expense will approximate $24.2 millionin total from fiscal 2007 through 2010. This expense projection is calculated as of September 29,2006 and does not take into account any future equity awards that we might issue nor does itaccount for future actual stock-based award forfeitures. We will be required to adjust futureshare-based compensation expense for actual future stock option forfeitures.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets intowhich we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapidtechnological change, rapid product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, shortproduct life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization,and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on ourability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. Thesuccessful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complexand depends on numerous factors, including:  the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes intechnology and industry standards,   the ability to obtain capacity sufficient to meet customer demand,   the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements,   the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,   overall market acceptance of our products, and   the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among otherfactors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems (ITSystems).We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment inresearch and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in atimely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned productdevelopment and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future marketgrowth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wirelesscommunications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products willsatisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipatenew industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able torespond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes inthe design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our productsinterface. If we fail to16Table of Contentsrapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and thatmeet our customers requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially andadversely harmed.In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We believethat to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and deliveringexisting products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. Wecannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remaincompetitive.The markets into which we sell our products are characterized by rapid technological change.The demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate. Our marketsgenerally exhibit the following characteristics:  rapid technological developments and product evolution,   rapid changes in customer requirements,   frequent new product introductions and enhancements,   demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size and decreased power consumption,   short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product, and   evolving industry standards.These changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products. Our products couldbecome obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipatedchange in one or more of the above-noted factors.The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development,manufacture and sale of our products is critical to our success.As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent asignificant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivatequalified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified managementand other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. Wemay have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of pooroperating performance, given, among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us andour competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability toattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on ourability to operate our business.If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) of communications electronics products do notdesign our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of otherproducts. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products toselect our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Withoutthese design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designsanother suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after adesign win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time toreduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commerciallysuccessful, or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we17Table of Contentswill continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and any failureto do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result insignificant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to sixmonths or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six monthsor more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycletime increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, whichcould reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, wemay incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrativeexpenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may nevergenerate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customercancels or changes its product plans.Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adverselyaffect our business.Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supplyarrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, wesell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsoldproducts. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for ourproducts, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMsindirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand willthen be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may changetheir inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of productorders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipatedorder volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result ininventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition.In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change indemand or for any other reason, the customers ability to make timely payments to us fornon-returnable products could be impaired.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded bad debt expense of $35.1 million.Specifically, the Company recorded charges related to two customers: Vitelcom Mobile and an Asiancomponent distributor.Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.On September 29, 2006, we had total indebtedness of approximately $229.3 million, which representedapproximately 25.2% of our total capitalization.As long as our 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due November 2007 remain outstanding, wewill have debt service obligations on such notes of approximately $8.5 million per year. If weissue other debt securities in the future, our debt service obligations will increase.Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends, we expect our existingsources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short terminvestments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equityfinancing, will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures,debt obligations (to replace existing or maturing debt instruments), purchase obligations, workingcapital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If necessary, among otheralternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtainother long-term debt, lines of credit and other financing.Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,18Table of Contents  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing,   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow fromoperations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flowavailable for other purposes, including capital expenditures,   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businessand the industry in which we compete, and   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitorsand competitors that have better access to capital resources.Despite our current debt levels, we are able to incur substantially more debt, which would increasethe risks described above.Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our operations.Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lostone or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased itsorders for our products, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Sales to ourthree largest customers, including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors, representedapproximately 50.0% of our net revenue for fiscal 2006. We expect that our largest customers willcontinue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in fiscal 2007 and for theforeseeable future.Average product life cycles in the semiconductor industry tend to be very short.In the semiconductor industry, product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales anddevelopment cycles. Therefore, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not resultin material revenue, and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory.If we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are notable to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results wouldbe materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices inanticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operatingresults would be harmed.We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.We might obtain additional sources of financing in the future. Based on our results of operationsfor fiscal 2006 and current trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cashexpected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability toaccess financial markets for additional debt or equity financing, will likely allow us tosufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchaseobligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. To theextent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund ourfuture activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debtfinancing. Conditions existing in the U.S. capital markets, if and when we seek additionalfinancing as well as the then current condition of the Company, will affect our ability to raisecapital, as well as the terms of any such financing. We may not be able to raise enough capital tomeet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain capital when required wouldhave a material adverse effect on us.In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow ourbusiness may require additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital requiredto fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.19Table of ContentsRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometryprocess technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products toincreasingly smaller line width geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturingprocesses for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign someexisting products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometryprocess technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturingyields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties,delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in thefuture. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition tosmaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able toeffectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships. Ifour foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficientlyimplement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could bematerially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expectto continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third partyintellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels ofdesign integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the UnitedStates, primarily countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we havesuppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and testfacilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subjectto a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limitedto, risks regarding:  currency exchange rate fluctuations,   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and political instability,   disruptions of capital and trading markets,   inability to collect accounts receivable,   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds andtrade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, import orexport controls and tariffs),   changes in legal or regulatory requirements,   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war,   limitations on the repatriation of funds,   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,   cultural differences in the conduct of business,   the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade,foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,   tax laws,   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce ourintellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.20Table of ContentsAdditionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators providesubsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impacthandset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impactthe demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuationsand market downturns.Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues,earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to anumber of factors, many of which are beyond our control.These factors include, among others:  changes in end-user demand for the products (principally digital cellularhandsets) manufactured and sold by our customers,   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in averageselling prices of our products,   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,   availability and cost of products from our suppliers,   the gain or loss of significant customers,   our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,   new product and technology introductions by competitors,   changes in the mix of products produced and sold,   market acceptance of our products and our customers, and   intellectual property disputes.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, couldmaterially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating resultsfail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affectthe price of our common stock.Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affectour revenues and operating results.Global economic weakness can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we serve, particularlywireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators. Although the wirelesscommunications industry has recovered somewhat from an industry-wide recession, such recovery maynot continue. In addition, we cannot predict what effects negative events, such as war or otherinternational conflicts, may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry. Thecontinued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to thisthreat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the global economy and tothe wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties. Further, a continuedeconomic recovery may not benefit us in the near term. If it does not, our ability to increase ormaintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired.21Table of ContentsOur gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices andcomponents, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenideintegrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differentialis due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated withsmaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offergallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justifythe cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expectthe costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producingtheir silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologiesfor certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. Wecannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performanceattributes of gallium arsenide solutions.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent usfrom using our technology.The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assertpatent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license theirtechnology or refrain from using it.Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringeintellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractualindemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly anddivert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of themerits of any specific claim, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because ofthe complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Iflitigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  pay substantial damages,   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,   discontinue the use of infringing technology,   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license maynot be available on commercially reasonable terms.We cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materiallyadversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items.Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties.We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes; evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasinglevels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtaintechnology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in acompetitive posture. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonableterms and conditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or ourcustomers products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In suchinstances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to developsubstitute technology to deliver competitive products.22Table of ContentsIf we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability tocompete.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as wellas nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietarytechnologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we oftenincorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into ourdesigns, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-partyintellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or likeactivities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or todetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. Thiscould require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of ourmanagement and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that:  the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or otherviolation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,suppliers or other third parties will be successful,   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or otherintellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated orcircumvented, or   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around ourpatents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting inloss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not bebroad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patentprotection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection inforeign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protectionmay be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.There is a growing industry trend to include or adapt open source software that is generally madeavailable to the public by its developers, authors or third parties. Often such software includeslicense provisions, requiring public disclosure of any derivative works containing open sourcecode. There is little legal precedent in the area of open source software or its effects oncopyright law or the protection of proprietary works. We take steps to avoid the use of open sourceworks in our proprietary software, and are taking steps to limit our suppliers from doing so.However, in the event a copyright holder were to demonstrate in court that we have not compliedwith a software license, we may be required to cease production or distribution of that work or topublicly disclose the source code for our proprietary software, which may negatively affect ouroperations or stock price.We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information throughoperational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former orcurrent employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without ourauthorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systemsor information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt ouroperations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate themethods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to effect suitable investments, alliances andacquisitions, and to integrate companies we acquire.Although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internalresearch and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and thesignificant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursuedevelopment of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to reviewinvestment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augmentour market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisitiontransactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in:  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,23Table of Contents  large one-time write-offs,   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,   amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and   the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees andcustomers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, witha charge against earnings. For instance, we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accountingprinciple in fiscal 2003 in the amount of $397.1 million as a result of the goodwill obtained inconnection with the Merger.Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult forsomeone to acquire control of us.We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate ofincorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions thatwould make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by ourBoard of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:  the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on astaggered basis, one class each year,   the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in oneor more series without further authorization of stockholders,   a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,   elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,   a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholdernominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meetingof stockholders,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent of our sharesbe obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision of ourcertificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtainedto amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to theelection and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to act by writtenconsent,   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtainedfor business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board ofDirectors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is thebeneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of Board ofDirectors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5%or more of our shares,   a fair price provision, and24Table of Contents  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtainedto amend or repeal the fair price provision.In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following thetime that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directorsthen in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements aremet.Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign ourexisting products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produceour products.The semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmentalregulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of varioussubstances, a number of which have been used in our products or processes. For example, theEuropean Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS)Directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removingsuch substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seekalternative substances, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of ourproducts and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program toensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternativesubstances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a singlesource, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally,if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject tofines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect ouroperating results.We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which couldadversely impact our business.We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturingoperations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmentalprotection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. We cannot assure you thatcurrent or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmentalregulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulationsregardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact ofenvironmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasinglyrequire warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. We cannotassure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfyenvironmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicableenvironmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, you might not beable to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them.The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Suchfluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:  our performance and prospects,   the performance and prospects of our major customers,   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,25Table of Contents  general financial and other market conditions, and   domestic and international economic conditions.Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility,particularly in the technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affectedthe market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to ordisproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies. These broad marketfluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and our price-to-earningsmultiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who oftenshift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction,particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Our Company has been, and in the future may be, thesubject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in ourstock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts orinvestors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price youpaid"
