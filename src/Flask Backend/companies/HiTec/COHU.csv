This Form 10-K also contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the markets for certain of our products, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, general publications, government data, and similar sources. PART I Item 1. Business.  Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) is a global technology leader supplying test, interface, automation, inspection and metrology products, software and services to the semiconductor industry. Cohu’s differentiated and broad product portfolio enables optimized yield and productivity, accelerating customers’ manufacturing time-to-market. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by increases in our product installed base and in the number of semiconductor devices that are tested, and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers. On January 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of MCT Worldwide, LLC (“MCT”), a U.S. based company with its principal manufacturing site in Penang, Malaysia. MCT provides automated solutions for the semiconductor industry and designs, manufactures, markets, services and distributes strip test handlers, film frame handlers and laser mark handlers. On October 2, 2023, we acquired Equiptest Engineering Pte. Ltd. (“EQT”), a Singapore-based company. EQT is a provider of semiconductor test contactors and other test consumables. MCT and EQT are included in Cohu’s consolidated results from operations as of the date of acquisition. On June 24, 2021, we completed the sale of our PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”) business, that represented the entirety of our PCB Test reportable segment. As part of this divestiture, we also sold certain intellectual property held by our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that was used by the PCB Test business. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. We have determined that we have one reportable segment, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”). Prior to the sale of our PCB Test business, we reported two segments, Semiconductor Test & Inspection and PCB Test. Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 11, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.             1     Table of Contents Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:      2023 (1) 2022(1) 2021  Semiconductor Test & Inspection   100%  100%  97% PCB Test   -%  -%  3%   100%  100%  100% (1) Our PCB Test segment was sold on June 24, 2021. Cohu was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and, in 1972, our name was changed to Cohu, Inc. Our Products We currently sell the following products: Semiconductor Automated Test Equipment (“ATE”) is used both for wafer-level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms for the system on a chip (“SoC”) device market. The Diamondx tester offers high-density instrumentation for testing various semiconductors: microcontrollers, application specific standard products (“ASSP”), power management, radio frequency (RF), display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx tester is a focused tester for RF Front End IC and Module applications. Semiconductor Handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobility, industrial and computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, film frame, laser mark, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) and thermal sub-systems. T-Core is our proprietary thermal technology for improving device under test temperature accuracy, enabling higher test yield, particularly for power dissipative devices such as microprocessors, graphic processor units, and high-performance semiconductors used in artificial intelligence data centers. Interface Products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test (such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology) and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. With the recent acquisition of EQT, we expanded our interface products in mid- to high-power contactors. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently, and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues. Inspection and Metrology are products that provide advanced vision capabilities. We offer a wide range of solutions for inspection of singulated molded leaded and leadless devices, and post-singulated wafer-level chip scale packages (“WLCSP”) and bare dies. NV-Core is our unique vision technology, enabling advanced inspection and metrology, such as 3-dimensional topographic inspection, sidewall micro-crack detection, and infrared inspection for sub-surface defect detection. DI-CoreTM Data Analytics is a comprehensive software suite used to optimize Cohu equipment performance. DI-Core data analytics provides real-time online performance monitoring and process control to improve utilization, manage predictive maintenance, and link semiconductor tester, handler and test contactor data. DI-Core data analytics is a software subscription service included in our recurring revenue. Spares and Kits are consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customers’ equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We also design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Spares and Kits are included in our recurring revenues.       2     Table of Contents Services are provided by our worldwide service organization and include installation and necessary maintenance of our systems’ installed base. We provide various parts and labor warranties on our test and handling systems and instruments. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of our systems as well as application, data management software and consulting services on our products. Services are included in our recurring revenues. Sales by Product Line and Related Marketing Efforts During the last three years, our consolidated net sales were distributed as follows:    2023    2022    2021   Semiconductor test & inspection systems (including kits)   51%  58%  61% Recurring revenues (1)   49%  42%  37% PCB test systems   -%  -%  2% (1) Recurring revenues include interface products, spares, kits (not as part of system sales), DI-Core software and services   We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our U.S. sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island and Norwood, Massachusetts. Our European sales offices are located in Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan. Customers Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:    2023    2022    2021   STMicroelectronics   12.0%  *   *  Analog Devices   *   *   14.1%              * Less than 10% of consolidated net sales.   The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors
” below. On June 24, 2021, we completed the divestment of our PCB Test business. No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the year ended December 25, 2021. Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 11, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Backlog Our backlog of unfilled orders for products was $160.4 million at December 30, 2023 and $279.8 million at December 31, 2022. Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.       3     Table of Contents Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of third-party systems which are not compatible with our systems. While we are the leading global supplier of test handlers, we face substantial competition from suppliers headquartered in Japan, China and Taiwan. In the semiconductor ATE market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide, and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world. Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Melaka, Malaysia; Laguna, Philippines; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Osaka, Japan; and Singapore. We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc.’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and test. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. While our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding a substantial portion of the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, we finance and own end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components. Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers or may be sole supplier sourced. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers. Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends heavily upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. We believe our intellectual property has value, and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. Research and Development Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $88.6 million in 2023, $92.6 million in 2022 and $92.0 million in 2021. We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully. Seasonality and Cyclicality  Historically, the semiconductor industry has been cyclical as well as seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, such as the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles and our business will continue to experience similar fluctuations.       4     Table of Contents Information About Our Executive Officers The following sets forth the names, ages, positions and offices held by all executive officers of Cohu as of February 7, 2024.

rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2023. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs relating to test handlers, test contactors and automated test equipment. In fiscal 2023, we incurred $88.6 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may, at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings and product enhancements can have a negative impact on our operating results. We have in the past made material investments in new product platforms that for various reasons, such as technical challenges or lack of customer adoption, have not generated the expected sales or return. There can be no assurance that other new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of test handling, ATE, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.       10     Table of Contents The semiconductor industry we serve is cyclical, seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin. Capital equipment providers in the semiconductor industry, such as Cohu, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in global economies and recurring cyclicality within the markets we serve. These cycles have resulted in periods of over-supply and excess capacity; a trend we believe will continue to occur. Our business and results of operations depend, in significant part, upon capital expenditures of manufacturers and designers of semiconductor devices and other industrial products, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. Disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse changes in economic conditions, and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products, may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased risk of restructuring charges, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues, which, in each case and together, adversely affect our operating results. We are unable to predict the likely duration, frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets, credit availability, and adverse economic conditions throughout the world will have on our customers, and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal year or quarter will be sustained in subsequent periods. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $4.5 million, $7.2 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. From quarter-to-quarter, we may see material swings in product mix among our test handler group (“THG”), interface solutions group (“ISG”) and semiconductor test group (“STG”) businesses, wherein each business has a different gross margin profile. Given the cyclical nature of our industry, we generally cannot accurately predict mix swings from quarter-to-quarter and such changes may have sudden adverse impacts on our gross margin. The erosion in mobility, and automotive & industrial market sales are collectively causing an adverse impact on our sales. A material portion of Cohu’s sales have historically been derived from customers that provide semiconductor devices for use within the mobility, and automotive & industrial markets. These markets continued to weaken during 2023. For example, mobility, and automotive & industrial system sales in the last twelve months (as measured from the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2023), compared to the prior year period, have declined 54% and 24%, respectively. This decline has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operating results. Given the inherent uncertainty and volatility within our industry, at this time, we are unable to predict when the mobility, and automotive & industrial markets, or the overall market, will recover or the extent of any such recovery. Any failure to effectively manage multiple overseas manufacturing operations could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. A substantial majority of our products are manufactured in Asia. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and manage overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or logistics, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management and logistics. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factor entitled “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, corruption and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.       11     Table of Contents Our suppliers are subject to fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our manufacturing and our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We outsource select manufacturing activities to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions. We outsource certain product manufacturing to third-party service providers. Outsourcing reduces our control over the performance of the outsourced functions. Dependence on outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. For example, we depend upon Jabil Manufacturing Co. (“Jabil”) to manufacture most of our semiconductor test systems from its facility located in Malaysia. In the event that Jabil is unable to meet Cohu’s current delivery schedule for semiconductor test systems, or if Jabil experienced unexpected downtime, we may not be able to sell to our customers, or have significant delays in fulfilling their orders. If we experienced significant delays or disruptions with Jabil, it would take us significant time to ramp up a new manufacturer for our semiconductor test products, either in-house or with another contract manufacturer. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing strategy or if third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or inefficiencies in the operation of our supply chain, any or all of which could delay our delivery of products to our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we deliver systems with defects, our reputation and demand of our systems may decrease, and the cost of quality events could be harmful to our operating results. In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced. When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems may be harmed. Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber-attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems. To proactively address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs. In addition, if any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation, which could make it more difficult to sell our products. Defects could also lead to product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers. Our product liability insurance policy currently provides both aggregate coverage as well as overall umbrella coverage. In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. For example, at the beginning of 2022, we experienced supply constraints and delays in accessing certain specialty semiconductors necessary for the production of test instruments for our semiconductor ATE products, and these supply constraints adversely impacted our overall gross margin in 2022. Although the supply constraints subsided during 2023, they may reoccur at any time due to factors beyond our control. More broadly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.       12     Table of Contents Inflationary pressures, along with any further increase in interest rates, increase the threat of recession and may impact our financial condition or results of operations. As a global manufacturer, we rely on raw materials, packaging materials, direct labor, energy, a large network of suppliers, distribution resources and transportation providers. In 2022 and 2023, these costs, including those for transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products, increased in large part due to global inflationary pressures. In addition, we also continue to incur higher employee wage costs and generally higher costs for outside services. These economic events are driven by factors beyond our control, and although inflationary pressures have recently moderated, we are unable to predict the future impacts, and such cost pressures may continue to adversely impact us in 2024 and beyond. Our efforts to offset these cost pressures, such as through product price increases, or attempting to reduce operating costs elsewhere, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume as customers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may purchase lower-priced competitive offerings or may delay some purchases altogether. To the extent that this may result in decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Further, an extended period of higher prices may lead to continued regulatory efforts to tame price inflation, resulting in an increased risk of recession. Our financial condition or operating results may also be affected by increased interest rates, which the Federal Reserve raised multiple times in 2022 and 2023. Increased interest rates intended to reduce price inflation may also contribute to the risk of recession, which may result in customer projections of slowed growth and an overall impact on customers’ and Cohu’s corporate earnings. We saw slowing customer demand in 2022 and 2023 and that trend has continued into 2024. While some experts believe that the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates in 2024, there can be no assurance that such rate cuts will happen or that such rate cuts will result in a reduction in expense to Cohu or its customers. Cohu is incurring interest expenses on our remaining indebtedness. In addition, our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions, with future inflationary pressures and efforts to rein in such an impact coupled with continued interest rate increases, thereby making it more costly for us to satisfy our obligations or causing an adverse effect on our free cashflows. The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and we may not be able to win business over that of our competition. The industries we serve are intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. In addition, there are emerging companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to price our existing products competitively and successfully introduce new competitively priced products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. We have increased investments in our test contactor business and targeted growth opportunities. However, the test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high localized customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to continue to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our test contactor operating results and impede us from achieving our test contactor sales goals.       13     Table of Contents With respect to Cohu’s ATE business, our ability to increase ATE sales depends, in part, on our ability to win new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, which is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. We also believe that our niche position results in greater sales cyclicality versus larger more diversified ATE vendors, and Cohu’s reliance on the mobility market for ATE sales had a significant adverse impact on our 2023 ATE sales. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future, experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after-sales support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. Consolidation in the semiconductor industry and within the semiconductor test equipment market could adversely affect the market for our products and negatively impact our ability to compete. Consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products, which could cause a decline in our revenues. With consolidation, the number of actual and potential customers for our products has decreased in recent years. Consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer, and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power. There has also been consolidation within the semiconductor test equipment market. This consolidation trend could change our interactions and relationships with complementary tester, instrument, and probe card suppliers, and negatively impact our revenue and operating results. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for products. Sudden demand changes in business conditions, positive or negative, are common in our industry but the timing of such changes is very difficult to predict. Regardless of the reason, sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment may have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, and with training and recruiting large numbers of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and quality controls. We may not be able to timely or successfully adjust our systems, facilities, production capacity and quality standards to meet our customers’ changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.       14     Table of Contents A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. For fiscal year 2023, net revenue from our ten largest customers represented 62% of our total net revenue. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. We expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture, market and support products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. Our customers’ selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant sales, service and engineering expenses, and to provide the customer evaluation systems for a period of time at no charge, in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. For example, we typically expend significant resources educating our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products, customizing our products in ways that are specific to the potential customer’s needs or loaning out test equipment, and we might not be reimbursed for such activities. The substantial resources we devote to our sales efforts may not result in any revenues from a customer. For example, any semiconductor project may never reach production or customers elect to validate a project with our products and then search for a lower cost vendor for production equipment. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring such expenditures. In addition, prospective customers might decide not to use our products or use our products for a relatively small percentage of their requirements after we have expended significant effort and expense toward product design, development, and/or manufacture. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected. The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers. In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers. Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities. If current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected. We must attract and retain experienced personnel to help support our future growth, and competition for such personnel in our industry is high. Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, administrative and manufacturing personnel. The loss of any of these key personnel, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, could harm our business and operating results. Despite our incentive arrangements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives. In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees. Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide and growth in the demand for semiconductors have increased demand and competition for qualified personnel has intensified. In addition, the cost of living in San Diego and the Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Kolbermoor, Germany; La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high, and increasing further due to inflationary effects, and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Competition for engineering and other technical personnel in some of the markets in which we operate is especially competitive due to continued increases in the number of technology companies worldwide. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and stock-based compensation, along with other benefits and workplace policies. If the anticipated value of our stock-based incentive awards does not materialize so that they cease to be viewed as valuable, if our profits decrease, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.       15     Table of Contents The use of, or failure to properly implement the use of, Artificial Intelligence within Cohu’s product development involves risks and uncertainties that may impact our operational performance and be subject to legal and/or regulatory action.  The information technology industry has experienced rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements We currently utilize, and expect in the future to continue to utilize, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technology within certain of our products, including data analytics software designed to provide predictive maintenance recommendations and vision inspection software designed to find pattern recognition within large image datasets. The primary goal of these technologies is to improve the efficiency and performance of our customer deployed systems. While our use of AI technology is intended to accelerate innovation and improve productivity, the algorithmic calculations used by AI may result in incorrect data production and flawed root cause analysis of identified issues. Additionally, it is likely that legal and/or regulatory actions that will be taken by impacted jurisdictions may include enhanced legislation that addresses the protection of individuals from data privacy harm resulting from AI use. Finally, an overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of or diminished human oversight and uncaught errors that could have a negative impact on our business operations and productivity. The continued rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, will require resources to develop, test and maintain our products and features to help us implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments in AI requirements or policies, we may lose our competitive position, and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete resulting in a loss of sales. Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business We are exposed to the risks of operating in certain foreign locations where Cohu manufactures certain products and supports our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products and support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. As such, we face risks in doing business globally. For example, while our corporate headquarters are located in California, additional key engineering, sales and administrative personnel are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere in the U.S., and our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and the U.S. Additionally, sales of our products to customers outside of the United States represent a significant part of our past and anticipated revenues. Our international sales as a percentage of our revenues were 88%, 90% and 91% for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain of our non-U.S. based customers also purchase through their subsidiaries in the United States. In the future we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  ●  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could affect the value of our assets denominated in local currency, as well as the price of our products relative to locally produced products;   ●  legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in, or interpretations of, requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;        16     Table of Contents  ●  trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;   ●  compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;   ●  complex labor laws and privacy regulations;   ●  difficulties in adequately supervising employees widely distributed around the world, including due to implementing remote and/or hybrid work arrangements;   ●  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   ●  longer payment cycles and receivable collections;   ●  fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions;   ●  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries;   ●  health epidemics or other disruptions to trade and production;   ●  local and global political and economic instability or foreign conflicts, including trade wars, that involve or affect the countries of our customers;   ●  natural disasters and other climate risks;   ●  varied environmental laws and regulations at each of our principal locations; and   ●  complex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation.”  Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We have observed a continuing trend of increasing risks and challenges in the conduct of our international business activities, including expanded tariffs and other trade barriers affecting the United States and China. Additionally, we are required to comply with foreign import and export requirements, customs and value added tax standards that can be unclear or complex. Our failure to meet these requirements and standards could negatively impact our business operations. If one or more of these risks occurs, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial results will suffer. Geopolitical instability in locations critical to Cohu and its customers may adversely impact our operations, sales and profitability. The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, a willingness to compete solely on price, favorable tariffs and other government preferences or subsidy programs, and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could negatively impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. An increase in geopolitical tensions in Asia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, could disrupt existing semiconductor chip manufacturing and increase the prospect of an interruption to the semiconductor chip supply across the world. A setback to the current state of relative peace and stability in the region could compromise existing semiconductor chip production and have downstream implications for our company. The world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer is located in Taiwan and is a top supplier for many U.S. companies, many of which are part of the company’s customer base. Recently, the armed conflict involving Hamas and Israel, as well as further escalation of tensions between Israel and various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, may cause increased inflation in energy and logistics costs and could further cause general economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate. It is unknown how long any of these disruptions will continue and whether such disruptions will become more severe.       17     Table of Contents The tensions related to Russia’s actions have resulted in the U.S. and many European countries imposing significant economic sanctions on Russia and specific individuals targeted as having connections to the Russian government. The totality of these actions has continued to impact international trade relationships, and resulted in sustained increases in the cost of materials, where higher oil and other commodity prices have resulted in further increased shipping and transportation costs. Furthermore, energy shortages, particularly with respect to natural gas, should they occur in Europe, would disrupt our test handler operations and research and development activities at our Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland facilities. In addition, the conflict could adversely impact the supply chain in this region, particularly with respect to critical materials and metals, such as palladium which is used in our interface products as well as in semiconductors. Any increases in the cost, or shortages, of materials or energy may continue to create supply issues for critical materials that could constrain manufacturing levels for Cohu’s customers, leading to a decrease in demand for Cohu’s products. The global impact of the military action and subsequent imposing of sanctions continues to evolve and cannot be sufficiently measured or predicted with certainty. The inherent uncertainty surrounding this war may negatively impact the share prices of publicly traded companies. Government entities and both public and private companies within the United States may be exposed to attempted or actual cybersecurity attacks launched in retaliation, resulting in disruptions to domestic markets and a prolonged state of global market volatility. Furthermore, there remains ongoing uncertainty with respect to China’s willingness to support ongoing or expanded sanctions, which could distance China from its existing trade partners, potentially creating a significant impact to the semiconductor chip and equipment industries that conduct operations within China, Taiwan and the region. There is a likelihood that these sanctions, and related geopolitical tensions, will not be resolved in the short-term but will have a lengthy disruption to all global companies. Any of these conflicts or other threatened conflicts, if they cause interruption to semiconductor chip supply and related impacts to the company’s customers, any increased costs, increased competition or constraints on resources such as freight, or other disruption in our supply chain, could result in an adverse impact to our financial results. The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales. Our corporate headquarters is located in the San Diego, California area, our Asian sales and service headquarters are located in Singapore and Taiwan, and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. Although we believe that we carry reasonable and appropriate business insurance, we may not be insured for certain losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have very limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. Our business could also be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, such as we were adversely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Our business has previously, and may in the future be, adversely impacted by evolving and extended public health requirements around the world; government-mandated facility shutdowns; import/export, shipping and logistics disruptions and delays; other supply chain and distribution constraints or delays; rapid changes to business, political or regulatory conditions affecting the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall global economy; availability of employees, increased sick time and lost employee productivity; risks associated with, at times, temporarily housing employees in our Malaysia and Philippines factories; remote working and increased cybersecurity risks; increased internal control risks over financial reporting as key finance staff work remotely; delayed product development programs; customers’ canceling, pushing out orders or refusal to accept product deliveries; delayed collection of receivables; other actions of our customers, suppliers and competitors which may be sudden and inconsistent with our expectations; higher shipping, trucking and logistics costs; higher component costs; manufacturing capacity limitations; additional credit rating agency downgrades could occur which would increase our cost of raising capital; and potential additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or inventory write-downs due to lower product demand may become necessary. Any of the foregoing, if they reoccur, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in these risk factors. With any reemerging COVID-19 surge or new health epidemic, we believe the risks of material adverse business disruption increase. We continuously monitor and react to the pandemic but cannot predict its future course or impacts.       18     Table of Contents Our business could be materially and adversely affected by transition and physical climate change effects and related matters. We analyze climate change risks in two separate categories: transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are those risks relating to the transition of the global economy to a focus on more climate-friendly technologies. This transition could have adverse financial impacts on us in several ways. For instance, more stringent environmental policies or regulations could lead to increased expenses relating to greenhouse gas emissions or other emissions that could increase our operating costs. Enhanced emissions-reporting or shifting technology could require us to write off or impair assets or retire existing assets early. Increased environmental mandates could also increase our exposure to litigation. We could be required to incur increased costs and significant capital investment to transition to lower emissions technologies. In addition, overall market shifts could increase costs of our raw materials and cause unexpected shifts in energy costs. Focus on sustainability has increased, and the company or its industry could be stigmatized as not friendly to the environment, which could adversely affect our reputation and our business, including due to difficulties in employee hiring and retention and our ability to access capital. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Physical risks from climate change that could affect our business include acute weather events such as floods, tornadoes or other severe weather and ongoing changes such as rising temperatures or extreme variability in weather patterns. These events could lead to increased capital costs from damage to our facilities, increased insurance premiums or reduced revenue from decreased production capacity based on supply chain interruptions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations (see risk factor entitled “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). We are exposed to additional risks as a result of increased attention by our stakeholders to sustainability, including environmental, social and governance matters. Our stakeholders, including customers, investors, advisory firms, employees, and suppliers, among others, are increasing their attention to, and establishing expectations for, sustainability and related matters. These expectations can extend to our corporate practices, initiatives, and disclosures, as well as stakeholder standards or preferences for investments or doing business. Third-party agencies have also established or added standards for rating companies on a range of sustainability-related factors that may be inconsistent and subject to change. As a result, these expectations may impact the attractiveness of our business, the manner in which we do business, our reputation, the costs of doing business, and the willingness of these stakeholders to engage with, invest in, or retain us. We may be further impacted by the adoption and evolution of sustainability-related regulation and legislation in the jurisdictions in which we do business, such as the SEC and California state disclosure requirements, which could result in increased compliance, operational, and other costs. In addition, the Company has provided voluntary disclosures on sustainability matters, including regarding energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and labor and human rights. Such disclosures are aspirational and based on frameworks and standards for such initiatives and progress that are still developing, assumptions that may change, and disclosure control and procedures that continue to evolve. We may fail, or be perceived to fail, in attaining or maintaining our sustainability-related initiatives. The topics on which we focus may not be popular with our stakeholders. These events or perceptions may expose us to additional reputational and operational risks. Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate. Integrating any business, product, technology or service into our current operations could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  ●  acquisitions may underperform and we may not achieve any forecasted growth, benefits or synergies;   ●  difficulties entering potentially new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;        19     Table of Contents  ●  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   ●  unexpected reduction of sales of existing products as a result of the introduction of new products;   ●  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;   ●  the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;   ●  diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters and current products and customers;   ●  product manufacturing disruptions and delays as we potentially consolidate certain manufacturing sites;   ●  difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;   ●  integration of acquired businesses and their operations, including enterprise resource planning systems, may be costly and time-consuming and divert resources away from other projects;   ●  the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;   ●  lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   ●  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;   ●  failure to commercialize or meet the expected performance of the purchased technology or business;   ●  failure to retain key employees and customer or supplier relationships;   ●  the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and   ●  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.  We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results. Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business. Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated.       20     Table of Contents We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, a material adverse impact on our business from unforeseen events or a desire to reduce our outstanding indebtedness could result in a need to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we could decide to raise capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities, particularly if we pursue additional acquisitions. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. For example, under our Credit Agreement which was repaid in full on February 9, 2024, we were limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Our foreign operations expose us to additional risks relating to currency fluctuations. Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars, but we incur certain costs in other currencies, and have certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. For example, we have significant business operations located in Germany and Switzerland, each of which engage in transactions with end customers, while costs related to manufacturing products are incurred in our manufacturing facilities in Asia and raw material supply chain costs are incurred in yet other currencies. We, therefore, face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings, despite our hedging of a portion of our international currency exposures. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky, may be ineffective, and could expose us to additional costs and risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have recorded restructuring, inventory write-offs and asset impairment charges in the past, and may do so again in the future, which could have a material negative impact on our business. We plan to record restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2024, have previously recorded restructuring charges in prior years and we may implement restructuring plans in the future, which would require us to take additional, potentially material, restructuring charges related to employee terminations, asset disposal or exit costs. We may also be required to write-off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of inventory experience declines, and such additional write-offs could constitute material charges. In addition, significant adverse changes in market conditions could require us to take additional material impairment charges related to our long-lived assets if the changes impact the critical assumptions or estimates that we use in our assessment of the recoverability of our long-lived assets. Any such additional charges, whether related to restructuring, asset impairment or factory underutilization, may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements. We are exposed to the instability of financial institutions where we maintain cash deposits or other liquid holdings, which could result in a lack of liquidity. To ensure financial flexibility, we maintain a substantial amount of cash deposit holdings in financial banks that exceed the limits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). A bank failure, default, or other adverse events that restrict the ability of financial institutions to perform, including elevated concerns of such potential events that are rapidly communicated across media platforms, may lead to liquidity constraints for those institutions. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), now a division of First Citizens Bank and formerly the country’s 16th largest bank by total assets, experienced a significant and rapid withdrawal of funds that led to its collapse. The FDIC determined that it would guarantee all deposit amounts held at SVB, including amounts above FDIC insurance limits. However, there is no guarantee that the FDIC will similarly protect deposit amounts held above insurance limits if other banks were to fail or other adverse conditions were to impact financial institutions. We held cash deposits at SVB in excess of FDIC insurance limits at the time of its failure totaling approximately $12.3 million which, based on the FDIC’s specific determination with respect to SVB, was fully protected and guaranteed by the FDIC and therefore we did not experience any losses on our cash deposits. Since that time, we have maintained a limited commercial relationship with SVB, but have minimal deposit risk when viewed as part of our overall financial strategy and diversification of assets across multiple financial institutions. While SVB’s collapse was partly driven by recent interest rate increases, which resulted in steep realized losses to cover the run on withdrawals, the potential for similar events occurring pose ongoing risk to us. Such events could cause the loss of cash deposits, limit our access to debt facilities and restrict our ability to obtain needed liquidity from financial institutions, hampering our ability to make strategic acquisitions or investments.       21     Table of Contents Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and other intangibles comprise 34% of Cohu’s total assets, of which approximately $241.7 million of our total assets are allocated to goodwill. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu’s common stock could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. When Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. There can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods. Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.  Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  ●  seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;   ●  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   ●  customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;   ●  inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   ●  inventory write-downs;   ●  unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;   ●  inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers;   ●  geopolitical changes impacting our business, including with respect to China and Taiwan;   ●  intangible and deferred tax asset write-downs; and   ●  general economic and market conditions, including impacts from sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine, increased inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. In addition, as a result of the Term Loan Credit Facility, which was recently paid in February 2024, we maintain credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). Any downgrades of Cohu’s credit ratings or rating outlooks, if and when they were to occur, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. Cohu’s current credit ratings are considered non-investment grade and make it more costly (as compared to investment grade borrowers) for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings.       22     Table of Contents If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. We are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and/or our stock price. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 30, 2023, the price of our common stock has ranged from $51.86 to $24.06. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment industry, our limited backlog, our debt levels, and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. We may underperform relative to our expectations. Our business and financial performance are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as described in these risk factors. We may not achieve our forecasted growth rates, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we expect and may incur losses in the business at any time. Any underperformance from our expectations or forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cause abrupt, significant stock price declines. We may become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or divestitures. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in other short-term focused corporate actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make a takeover of Cohu more difficult. There are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Delaware law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company. We may seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to meet our strategic initiatives or operating activities. We have in the past issued common stock as acquisition consideration and for general corporate purposes. For example, in March 2021, we issued 5,692,500 additional shares of our common stock in an underwritten follow-on public offering, which represented an increase of 13.4% of outstanding shares of common stock at the time. We may determine to utilize common stock as acquisition consideration, issue convertible debt, or pursue another follow-on equity offering to raise capital for debt reduction or for other general corporate purposes, at any time in the future. Any issuances of additional shares of our common stock would dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders would have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of equity issuance. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.       23     Table of Contents Cohu’s stock repurchase program may not have an impact that is fully reflected in the current stock valuation. Effective November 2, 2021, a $70 million share repurchase program was authorized by our Board of Directors. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $70 million under the share repurchase program. The stock repurchase program was authorized to potentially offset dilution from equity issuances under Cohu’s equity incentive plans and because the Board believes that, for reasons unrelated to the company’s performance, the trading price of Cohu’s common stock from time to time may not be reflective of the true value of the Company. Any repurchases have been and may be made in the future using our existing cash resources. The Company gives no assurances as to when, how much and for what duration stock repurchases may be made. However, stock repurchases may adversely affect the Company if the economy turns downward, as it could leave the Company limited in its ability to obtain cash necessary for ongoing operations or strategic initiatives. In addition, any repurchase of stock may have no positive impact on our stock price. Further, as stock may be repurchased, given the volatility of our stock price, we may repurchase stock at prices which, in hindsight, are materially higher than the subsequent price of our stock. Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs, modifications to international trade policy, increased duties, tariffs or other export restrictions, public company reporting requirements, climate change and environmental regulation, corporate tax legislation, new employment and privacy laws, and antitrust enforcement. Trade regulations and restrictions impact our ability to manufacture certain products and to sell to certain customers, specifically in China, which may materially harm and limit Cohu’s business. We are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances are required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. There have been several significant changes in U.S. export regulations relating to China since 2019. More recently, in 2022, export controls were issued relating to the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing, advanced computing, and supercomputer industries, where these additional controls may impact our ability, and/or that of our customers, to sell and ship products to semiconductor fabrication facilities located in China. These export controls include restrictions on certain semiconductor integrated circuits, commodities containing such integrated circuits, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Furthermore, the export controls restrict the ability of U.S. persons to support the development or production of integrated circuits at certain semiconductor fabrication facilities in China. In addition to the specific restrictions impacting our business, the regulations may have an adverse impact on certain actual or potential customers and on the global semiconductor industry. To the extent the regulations impact actual and potential customers or disrupt the global semiconductor industry, our business and revenues will be adversely impacted. Additionally, these collective export restrictions and the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations have encouraged China-based companies to actively seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our foreign competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to China-based companies. These ongoing actions indicate that the U.S. government may impose other new export restrictions. If implemented with no prior notice, even controls that ultimately have minimal long-term impact to Cohu, may create short-term limitations on Cohu’s business as it evaluates the full impact of such new and any subsequent controls. The prospect of future export controls that are implemented in a similar manner may continue to have an ongoing impact on Cohu’s business, results of operations, or financial conditions.       24     Table of Contents Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German, Singaporean, Philippines, and Thailand subsidiaries have income tax returns currently under routine examination by tax authorities for different periods between 2017 and 2021. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also adversely impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information during our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This increased our effective tax rate and our cash tax payable in 2022 and 2023. If the requirement to capitalize Section 174 expenditures is not modified, it may also continue to adversely impact our effective tax rate and our cash tax liability in future years. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion & Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) reached agreement on the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules in October 2021 to address the challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. These new Global Anti-Base Erosion (“GloBE”) rules are now being implemented by jurisdictions around the world and will apply to many companies from 2024. Pillar Two introduces a global minimum Effective Tax Rate (“ETR”) where multinational groups with consolidated revenue over €750m are subject to a minimum ETR of 15% on income arising in low-tax jurisdictions. These specific actions did not impact our consolidated financial statements in 2023. However, it is likely that these new rules will have an impact in some form on our operations and financial results and may adversely impact our operational decisions and/or our profitability. We have tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements in the Philippines and Malaysia which may change or cease to be in effect or applicable, in part or in whole, for reasons within or beyond our control. In addition, if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws, incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect or are otherwise modified, our corporate income tax burden may significantly increase. Also, some of our various tax incentives in Malaysia are expiring and if we are unable to secure renewal of the expiring tax incentives, our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs and any failure to comply with such laws may result in severe sanctions and liabilities, which may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Some of our distribution partners are located in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. The policies and procedures we have implemented to discourage these practices by our employees, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be ineffective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurances that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.       25     Table of Contents In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. SEC has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities, and new laws and regulations (such as involving climate change) or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. In addition, new regulations or shareholder or other public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Intellectual Property, Privacy and Litigation Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches within our operational systems or products. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We have been impacted by immaterial “phishing” schemes and we are continuing our efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. We believe that the implementation of extensive employee telework practices has increased our cybersecurity risks. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. See Item 1C entitled “Cybersecurity” for additional information about our cybersecurity processes, oversight, risk mitigation and governance. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Any future attacks which may disrupt our IT systems, or those of our suppliers, could impact our sales, financial results and stock price.       26     Table of Contents We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage. We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our products, and have filed applications for additional patents. Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, however, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future. In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and/or may be challenged by third parties. Third parties may also design around our patents or copy our patented inventions without our knowledge. In addition to patent protection, we rely upon copyrights for protection of our proprietary software and documentation, trademarks for protection of our brand and source of goods, and trade secret law and confidentiality and exclusivity agreements for protection of our confidential and proprietary information and technology. These measures do not guarantee protection of our intellectual property, however. We can give no assurance that our copyrights will be upheld or will successfully deter infringement by third parties. Even though we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition. It is also possible that third parties will misappropriate our trade secrets or other confidential information. We may be subject to cybersecurity breaches in which a third party obtains our confidential information. Third parties may also reverse engineer our products to copy our technology. Any of these circumstances could result in harm to our competitive position in the market. Failure to protect our trademarks can lead to other companies selling products using confusing similar names, thereby damaging our brand. In some countries, it can be difficult to register trademarks because of the strict examination process or blocking trademarks for other goods. Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market. From time to time, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation against other persons or entities to protect and/or enforce our intellectual property or contractual rights. However, litigation is costly and time consuming and there is no assurance that any lawsuit we bring will yield the result that we seek, as (i) the lawsuit may be dismissed or there could be an adverse finding, (ii) we may not be able to pursue the lawsuit due to the laws of the applicable country or (iii) there may be a subsequent unfavorable change in law that limits our ability to pursue the lawsuit. For example, litigation discovery practice in China, Japan, South Korea, continental Europe and Taiwan is not as robust as the United States, so it can be more difficult to determine if a company is infringing on our patents and more challenging to bring a lawsuit. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use are also difficult and the measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Accordingly, infringement of our intellectual property rights poses a serious risk of doing business. There is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries. For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products. If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries resulting in a loss of sales. We may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business. Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.       27     Table of Contents While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Data privacy, identity protection and information security compliance may require significant resources and presents certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, customer data, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. We continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not process individual credit card information, but we do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and/or the California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We could face negative consequences in the future if we, our suppliers, channel partners, customers or other third parties experience the actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of data. Such an event could lead customers to select the products and services of our competitors. An incident could harm our reputation, cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers’ perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation, which could result in the loss of sales or curtailed growth. While we maintain general liability and cybersecurity insurance coverage, such coverage might not be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, that such coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. We currently are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative, regulatory or governmental proceedings, including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. "
8,COHU,COHU INC,2023-02-17,": Risk Factors
,” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Form 10-K also contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the markets for certain of our products, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, general publications, government data, and similar sources. PART I Item 1. Business. Cohu is a global technology leader supplying test, automation, inspection and metrology products and services to the semiconductor industry. Cohu’s differentiated and broad product portfolio is designed to optimize semiconductor manufacturing yield and productivity, accelerating customers’ time-to-market. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by an increase in the number of semiconductor devices that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers. MCT Worldwide, LLC (“MCT”), acquired by Cohu on January 30, 2023, is a United States (“U.S.”) based company with a principal manufacturing site in Penang, Malaysia. MCT provides automated solutions for the semiconductor industry and designs, manufactures, markets, services and distributes strip test handlers, film frame handlers and laser mark handlers. The acquisition of MCT was completed subsequent to Cohu’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and certain disclosures include MCT to enable investors to evaluate the operating and financial effects to our business recognized in the subsequent accounting period. Unless otherwise indicated, disclosures made throughout this Form 10-K exclude the effect of the acquisition of MCT. On June 24, 2021, we completed the sale of our PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”) business, that represented the entirety of our PCB Test reportable segment. As part of this divestiture, we also sold certain intellectual property held by our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that was used by the PCB Test business. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. We have determined that we have one reportable segment, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”). Prior to the sale of our PCB Test Group (“PTG”) on June 24, 2021, we reported two segments, Semiconductor Test & Inspection and PCB Test Equipment. Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.        1     Table of Contents Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:    2022(1)  2021(1)  2020  Semiconductor Test & Inspection   100%  97%  92% PCB Test   -%  3%  8%   100%  100%  100%  (1) Our PCB Test segment was sold on June 24, 2021.   Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc. Our Products We currently sell the following products: Semiconductor Automated Test Equipment (“ATE”) is used both for wafer level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms for the system on a chip (“SoC”) device market. The Diamondx tester offers high-density instrumentation for testing microcontrollers, application specific standard products (“ASSP”), power management, display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx tester is focused primarily on the RF Front End IC and Module applications. Semiconductor Handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobility, industrial and computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, film frame, laser mark, MEMS and thermal sub-systems. Interface Products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues. Inspection and Metrology are products that provide advanced vision capabilities. We offer a wide range of solutions for inspection of singulated molded leaded and leadless devices, and post-singulated wafer level chip scale packages (“WLCSP”) and bare dies. NV-Core is our unique vision technology, enabling advanced inspection and metrology, such as 3-dimensional topographic inspection, sidewall micro-crack detection, and infrared inspection for sub-surface defect detection. Data Analytics (“DI-Core”) is a comprehensive software suite used to optimize Cohu equipment performance. DI-Core provides real-time online performance monitoring and process control to improve utilization, manage predictive maintenance, and link semiconductor tester, handler and test contactor data. DI-Core is included in our recurring revenue. Spares and Kits are consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customers’ equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We also design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Spares and Kits are included in our recurring revenues. Services are provided by our worldwide service organization and include installations and necessary maintenance of systems sold. We provide various parts and labor warranties on test and handling systems and instruments designed and manufactured by us. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of our systems as well as application, data management software and consulting services on our products. Services are included in our recurring revenues.      2   Table of Contents Sales by Product Line  During the last three years, our consolidated net sales were distributed as follows:    2022    2021    2020   Semiconductor test & inspection systems (including kits)   58%  61%  50% Recurring revenues (1)   42%  37%  45% PCB test systems   -%  2%  5%   (1)  Recurring revenues include interface products, spares, kits (not as part of system sales), DI-Core and services  Customers Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:    2022    2021    2020   Analog Devices   *   14.1%  *   *  Less than 10% of consolidated net sales.  The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On June 24, 2021, we completed the divestment of our PCB Test business. No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 25, 2021 or December 26, 2020. Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Sales and Marketing We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our U.S. sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California, St. Paul, Minnesota, Lincoln, Rhode Island, Norwood, Massachusetts and, subsequent to our recent acquisition of MCT on January 30, 2023, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our European sales offices are located in Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan. Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we believe that we are the leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition in Japan and Taiwan which represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. Test subcontractors in Asia also show preference to purchase from local Asian competitors. In the semiconductor ATE market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide, and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world.        3     Table of Contents Backlog Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, was $279.8 million at December 31, 2022 and $292.9 million at December 25, 2021. Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia and subsequent to our acquisition of MCT on January 30, 2023, Penang, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contactors); Lincoln, Rhode Island (connectors); and Osaka, Japan (probe pins). We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc.’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our sole source contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and test. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, except with regard to end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components which are financed and owned by Cohu. Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers or may be sole supplier sourced. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers. Patents and Trademarks Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value, and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Research and Development Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $92.6 million in 2022, $92.0 million in 2021 and $86.2 million in 2020. We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales. Seasonality Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles. See the risk factor entitled “The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin.”        4     Table of Contents Information About Our Executive Officers The following sets forth the names, ages, positions and offices held by all executive officers of Cohu as of February 8, 2023.

To ensure we maintain our position as a global leader in the semiconductor test and inspection space, we are committed to providing a safe and positive work environment for our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development, respect for individuals and ethical conduct, and that is facilitated by a direct management-employee engagement model. Diversity, Inclusion, and Non-discrimination We welcome and value diversity ensuring that our work benefits from a broad range of viewpoints and perspectives. We strive to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or gender expression, national origin or ancestry, age, disability, veteran status, military service, sexual orientation, genetic information, and any other protected category recognized under applicable laws. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. We are committed to respecting and protecting the human rights of all our employees. Employees Including headcount additions arising from our acquisition of MCT, as of January 30, 2023, we had approximately 3,218 employees, including approximately 104 temporary employees, in 24 countries. Approximately 19% of our employees are located in the Americas, 13% are located in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and 68% are located in Asia Pacific. Our employee headcount has fluctuated in the last five years primarily due to the volatile and unpredictable business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry and has also been impacted by acquisitions and divestitures. Management Engagement Practices We adhere to our core values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with a commitment to treating our employees and all our partners with professionalism, dignity and respect. We pride ourselves at fostering an innovative environment and collaborative work relationships. This includes respecting principles of freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining in accordance with applicable laws. Our employees in the U.S. and most locations in Asia are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, certain employees at our operation in Germany are represented by a works council and employees in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland are members of the microtechnology and Swiss watch trade union. The Collective Bargaining Agreement of “Metallurgie (ingenieurs et cadres)” is applicable to all employees of our French subsidiary and certain employees in our China operation belong to local trade unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good.        6     Table of Contents Health and Safety The health and safety of our employees is of utmost important to us. Cohu works to protect the health and safety of employees and our customers and intends to conduct all business activities in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We encourage and strive to have every employee actively champion those behaviors and the attitudes necessary to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses, property damage, and adverse impact to the environment. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective equipment (e.g., eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, our subcontractors and our customers. These protocols include complying with physical distancing, enhanced hygiene and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, and taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including segments of our workforce working remotely. As COVID-19 has evolved to a more endemic state, we have continued monitoring and complying with governmental guidelines for safe operations and have returned, but not fully, to the levels of travel and in person interactions that occurred prior to the pandemic. In addition, while our manufacturing sites have continued at pre-pandemic occupancy and function, a portion of our employees that moved to remote work are continuing in fully remote or hybrid work status. Compensation and Benefits Cohu is committed to providing market competitive compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate a high performing workforce critical to our long-term success. As part of our compensation philosophy, we focus Cohu’s workforce on our financial and other business goals to drive and motivate employee performance in key areas through the administration of our management incentive plan, equity incentive plan, global profit-sharing and other local bonus plans, as may be applicable to a given position. Cohu also complies with applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of our employees with shareholders, grants of restricted stock units are provided to many of our employees on an annual basis and all eligible employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock, at a 15% discount, through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

 Summary Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the full “Risk Factors
” described below and should not be relied upon as a complete summary of the material risks facing our business. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic   ●  While the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized within many global regions, it may cyclically continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry   ●  We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful.    ●  We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.    ●  A failure to perform or unexpected downtime experienced by our sole source contract manufacturer for certain semiconductor automated test equipment could adversely impact our operations.    ●  Ongoing inflationary pressures on costs, including those for raw and packaging materials, components and subassemblies, labor and distribution costs, along with rising interest rates, increase the threat of recession and may impact our financial condition or results of operations.    ●  The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin.    ●  The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive.    ●  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.    ●  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.    ●  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler and automated test equipment suppliers.         8     Table of Contents Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business   ●  Geopolitical instability in locations critical to Cohu and its customers’ business, manufacturing, and engineering operations may adversely impact our operations and sales.    ●  Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm and limit Cohu’s business and restrict our ability to sell its products, specifically within China.  Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions   ●  We are exposed to other risks associated with additional potential acquisitions, investments and divestitures such as integration difficulties, disruption to our core business, dilution of stockholder value, and diversion of management attention.  Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock   ●  Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.    ●  We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.  Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Intellectual Property and Litigation   ●  Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches within our operational systems or products.  For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic While the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized within many global regions, it may cyclically continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and its related macroeconomic effects have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations in a cyclical manner. As the COVID-19 virus has evolved from March 2020 to the present, with subsequent variants emerging, authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates, and shutdowns, including at various times in all of the jurisdictions where we operate. These measures have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, Japan and the Philippines, and each of these countries has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been common for restrictions to be implemented, relaxed and then implemented again with little or no notice, which adversely impacts our ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses and is disruptive to our operations. Although we believe that Cohu qualifies as an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our business has been, and may in the future be, adversely impacted by evolving and extended public health requirements around the world; government-mandated facility shutdowns; import/export, shipping and logistics disruptions and delays; other supply chain and distribution constraints or delays; rapid changes to business, political or regulatory conditions affecting the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall global economy; availability of employees, increased sick time and lost employee productivity; risks associated with, at times, temporarily housing employees in our Malaysia and Philippines factories; remote working IT and increased cybersecurity risks; increased internal control risks over financial reporting as key finance staff work remotely; delayed product development programs; customers’ canceling, pushing out orders or refusal to accept product deliveries; delayed collection of receivables; other actions of our customers, suppliers and competitors which may be sudden and inconsistent with our expectations; higher shipping, trucking and logistics costs; higher component costs; manufacturing capacity limitations; additional credit rating agency downgrades could occur which would increase our cost of raising capital; and potential additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or inventory write-downs due to lower product demand may become necessary. Any of the foregoing COVID-19 driven impacts, if they reoccur, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in these risk factors. With any successive COVID-19 surge, we believe the risks of material adverse business disruption increase. We continuously monitor and react to the pandemic but cannot predict its future course or impacts.        9     Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful. Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new and enhanced product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace and to enter new markets. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs relating to test contactors, test handlers and automated test equipment. In fiscal 2022, we incurred $92.6 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may, at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings and product enhancements can have a negative impact on our operating results. We have in the past made material investments in new product platforms that for various reasons, such as technical challenges or lack of customer adoption, have not generated the expected sales or return. There can be no assurance that other new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. A substantial majority of our products are manufactured in Asia. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or logistics, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management and logistics. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factors entitled “While the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized within many global regions, it may cyclically continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, corruption and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our manufacturing and our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.        10     Table of Contents A failure to perform or unexpected downtime experienced by our sole source contract manufacturer for certain semiconductor test systems could adversely impact our operations. We depend upon Jabil Manufacturing Co. (“Jabil”) to manufacture most of our semiconductor test systems from its facility located in Malaysia. In the event that Jabil is unable to meet Cohu’s current delivery schedule for semiconductor test systems, or if Jabil experienced unexpected downtime, we may not be able to sell, or have significant delays, in fulfilling our customer orders. If we experienced significant delays or disruptions with Jabil, it would take us significant time to ramp up a new manufacturer for our semiconductor test products, either in-house or with another contract manufacturer. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. For example, at the beginning of 2022, we experienced supply constraints and delays in accessing certain specialty semiconductors necessary for the production of test instruments for our semiconductor ATE products, and these supply constraints adversely impacted our overall gross margin in 2022. Although the supply constraints have subsided entering 2023, they may reoccur at any time due to factors beyond our control. More broadly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Ongoing inflationary pressures on costs, including those for raw and packaging materials, components and subassemblies, labor and distribution costs, along with rising interest rates, increase the threat of recession and may impact our financial condition or results of operations. As a global manufacturer, we rely on raw materials, packaging materials, direct labor, energy, a large network of suppliers, distribution resources and transportation providers. In 2022, these costs, including those for transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products, increased. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant increases in freight and shipping costs, and global inflationary pressures have pushed those costs even higher. In addition, we continue to see price increases and shortages on certain specialty semiconductors necessary for the production of test instruments for our semiconductor ATE products, and these events have adversely impacted our gross margins on such products. Further, we also continue to incur higher employee wage costs and generally higher costs for outside services. These events are driven by factors beyond our control, and although we are unable to predict the longer-term impacts, we expect these cost pressures to continue in 2023. Our efforts to offset these cost pressures, such as through product price increases, or attempting to reduce operating costs elsewhere, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume as customers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may purchase lower-priced competitive offerings or may delay some purchases altogether. To the extent that this may result in decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Further, an extended period of higher prices may lead to continued regulatory efforts to tame price inflation, resulting in an increased risk of recession. Our financial condition or operating results may also be affected by increasing interest rates, which the Federal Reserve raised multiple times in 2022, with expectations for additional increases in 2023. The raising of interest rates intended to cool down price inflation may also contribute to the risk of recession, which may result in customer projections of slowed growth and an overall impact on customer’s and Cohu’s corporate earnings. We saw slowing customer demand in 2022 and that trend has continued into 2023. Cohu is incurring increased interest expenses on our remaining indebtedness. In addition, our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions, with future inflationary pressures and efforts to reign in such an impact coupled with continued interest rate increases, thereby making it more costly for us to satisfy our obligations.      11   Table of Contents The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, including the level of product sales and overall gross margin, and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $7.2 million, $7.1 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. We saw weakness in market conditions in 2019, followed by COVID-19 driven uncertainties in 2020, then a significant market recovery beginning in third quarter 2020. After record sales in 2021, demand weakened in 2022. Abrupt, unexpected and severe demand changes have occurred in the past and are expected to reoccur in the future within our industry. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, we have seen demand fluctuations in our test handler group (“THG”) and semiconductor test group (“STG”) businesses. Our recent sales have become more weighted toward THG and less toward STG products, which have had a material negative impact on our gross margins. The company took action to reduce expenses and improve overall operational efficiency, and such actions largely offset the mix-related gross margin impacts. Given the nature of our industry, we generally cannot accurately predict mix swings from quarter-to-quarter and such changes may have sudden adverse impacts on our gross margin. The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive. The industries we serve are intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. In addition, there are emerging companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to price our existing products competitively and successfully introduce new competitively priced products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. We have increased investments in our test contactor business and targeted significant growth opportunities. However, the test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high localized customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to continue to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our test contactor operating results and impede us from achieving our test contactor sales goals. With respect to Cohu’s automated test equipment (“ATE”) business, our ability to increase ATE sales depends, in part, on our ability to win new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, which is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. We also believe that our niche position results in greater sales cyclicality versus larger more diversified ATE vendors and Cohu experienced such adverse cyclicality in 2022. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.        12     Table of Contents Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of test handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future, experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.        13     Table of Contents The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, and with training and recruiting large numbers of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to timely or successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Sudden demand changes in business conditions, positive or negative, are common in our industry but the timing of such changes is very difficult to predict. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. For fiscal year 2022, net revenue from our ten largest customers represented 56% of our total net revenue. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Also, consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products, which could cause a decline in our revenues. With consolidation, the number of actual and potential customers for our products has decreased in recent years. Consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer, and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power. We expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler and automated test equipment suppliers. The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market (see risk factor “Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition”). In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, a willingness to compete solely on price, favorable tariffs and other government preferences, and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture, market and support products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. Our customers’ selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant sales, service and engineering expenses, and to provide the customer evaluation systems for several months at no charge, in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring such expenditures. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales.        14     Table of Contents In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs. In addition, if any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation, which could make it more difficult to sell our products. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Kolbermoor, Germany; La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high, and increasing further due to inflationary effects, and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risks that our executives and other key employees may be suddenly unable to perform their duties due to health or other personal responsibilities. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business We are exposed to the risks of operating in certain foreign locations where Cohu manufactures certain products and supports our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products and support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. As such, we face risks in doing business globally. For example, while our corporate headquarters are located in California, additional key engineering, sales, and administrative personnel are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere in the U.S., and our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and the U.S. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  ●  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in, or interpretations of, requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;   ●  trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;   ●  compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;   ●  complex labor laws and privacy regulations;   ●  difficulties in adequately supervising employees widely distributed around the world (including due to implementing remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and still continuing for certain functions);   ●  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   ●  longer payment cycles and receivable collections;         15     Table of Contents  ●  health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;   ●  local and global political and economic conditions, including ongoing uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications;   ●  natural disasters and other climate risks and geopolitical instability;   ●  varied environmental laws and regulations at each of our principal locations;   ●  complex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and   ●  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.  Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not sell to consumers nor process individual credit card information, but do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the recently effective California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs. If one or more of these risks occurs, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial results will suffer. Geopolitical instability in locations critical to Cohu and its customers’ business, manufacturing, and engineering operations may adversely impact our operations and sales. An increase in geopolitical tensions in Asia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, could disrupt existing semiconductor chip manufacturing and increase the prospect of an interruption to the semiconductor chip supply across the world. A setback to the current state of relative peace and stability in the region could compromise existing semiconductor chip production and have downstream implications for our company. The world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer is located in Taiwan and is a top supplier for many U.S. companies, many of which are part of the company’s customer base. Further, recent geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia could adversely impact the supply chain in this region, particularly with respect to critical materials and metals, such as palladium which is used in our interface products as well as in semiconductors. Any interruption to semiconductor chip supply and its related impact to the company’s customers, or any disruption in our supply chain, could result in an adverse impact to our financial results. Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and exchange rates, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial conditions that we currently cannot predict.  In fiscal year 2022, 90% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan. Given our extensive global operations, we are subject to immediate impacts from any changing tariff or export regulations (see risk factor entitled “Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm Cohu’s business and ability to sell its products without limitations”). It remains our plan to continue our international growth. We have business operations within the jurisdictions listed above, and while we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we incur certain costs in other currencies. As a result, the company holds exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings, despite actions we take to minimize those currency exposures. Additionally, engaging in foreign currency contracts to minimize such currency exposure could result in additional costs and risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.        16     Table of Contents The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters are located in Singapore and Taiwan, and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. Although we believe that we carry reasonable and appropriate business insurance, we may not be insured for certain losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have very limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. Our business could also be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, and has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic (see risk factor entitled “While the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized within many global regions, it may cyclically continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations”). Our business could be materially and adversely affected by climate change and related matters. We analyze climate change risks in two separate categories: transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are those risks relating to the transition of the global economy to a focus on more climate-friendly technologies. This transition could have adverse financial impacts on us in several ways. For instance, more stringent environmental policies or regulations could lead to increased expenses relating to green-house gas emissions or other emissions that could increase our operating costs. Enhanced emissions-reporting or shifting technology could require us to write off or impair assets or retire existing assets early. Increased environmental mandates could also increase our exposure to litigation. We could be required to incur increased costs and significant capital investment to transition to lower emissions technologies. In addition, overall market shifts could increase costs of our raw materials and cause unexpected shifts in energy costs. Focus on sustainability has increased, and the company or its industry could be stigmatized as not friendly to the environment, which could adversely affect our reputation and our business, including due to difficulties in employee hiring and retention and our ability to access capital. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Physical risks from climate change that could affect our business include acute weather events such as floods, tornadoes or other severe weather and ongoing changes such as rising temperatures or extreme variability in weather patterns. These events could lead to increased capital costs from damage to our facilities, increased insurance premiums or reduced revenue from decreased production capacity based on supply chain interruptions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations (see risk factor entitled “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm and limit Cohu’s business and restrict our ability to sell products, specifically within China. There have been significant changes in U.S. export regulations relating to China since 2019. Such changes initially included restrictions on exports to certain China-domiciled entities including Huawei and broader definitions and restrictions on “military end users” and “uses.” In 2022, export controls were issued relating to the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing, advanced computing, and supercomputer industries, where these additional controls may impact our ability, and/or that of our customers, to sell and ship products to semiconductor fabrication facilities located in China. These export controls include restrictions on certain semiconductor integrated circuits, commodities containing such integrated circuits, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Furthermore, the export controls restrict the ability of U.S. persons to support the development or production of integrated circuits at certain semiconductor fabrication facilities in China. These collective export restrictions and the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations have encouraged China-based companies to actively seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our foreign competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to China-based companies. These ongoing actions indicate that the U.S. government may impose other new export restrictions. If implemented with no prior notice, even controls that ultimately have minimal long-term impact to Cohu, may create short-term limitations on Cohu’s business as it evaluates the full impact of such new and any subsequent controls. The prospect of future export controls that are implemented in a similar manner may continue to have an ongoing impact on Cohu’s business, results of operations, or financial conditions.        17     Table of Contents Political instability resulting from the military incursion into Ukraine by Russia continues to cause significant disruption to foreign and domestic economies, leading to broad and significant economic sanctions against Russia with an ongoing impact to material and commodity prices while raising sustained global uncertainty. The tensions related to Russia’s actions have resulted in the United States and many European countries imposing significant economic sanctions on Russia and specific individuals targeted as having connections to the Russian government. The totality of these actions has continued to impact international trade relationships, and resulted in sustained increases in the cost of materials, where higher oil and other commodity prices have resulted in further increased shipping and transportation costs. Furthermore, energy shortages, particularly with respect to natural gas, should they occur in Europe, would disrupt our test handler operations and research and development activities at our Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de-Fonds facilities. Any increases in the cost, or shortages, of materials or energy may continue to create supply issues for critical materials that could constrain manufacturing levels for Cohu’s customers, leading to a decrease in demand for Cohu’s products. The global impact of the military action and subsequent imposing of sanctions continues to evolve and cannot be sufficiently measured or predicted with certainty. The inherent uncertainty surrounding this war may negatively impact the share prices of publicly traded companies. Government entities and both public and private companies within the United States may be exposed to attempted or actual cybersecurity attacks launched in retaliation, resulting in disruptions to domestic markets and a prolonged state of global market volatility. Furthermore, there remains ongoing uncertainty with respect to China’s willingness to support ongoing or expanded sanctions, which could distance China from its existing trade partners, potentially creating a significant impact to the semiconductor chip and equipment industries that conduct operations within China, Taiwan and the region. There is a likelihood that these sanctions, and related geopolitical tensions, will not be resolved in the short-term but will have a lengthy disruption to all global companies. Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital Our Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, take certain actions. Cohu’s existing indebtedness of approximately $79 million, primarily the result of Cohu previously entering into a term loan facility (the “Credit Agreement”), limits our ability to:  ●  incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;   ●  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;   ●  pay cash dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;   ●  enter into rate, commodity, equity or currency swap, hedging or other similar transactions;   ●  make loans, investments or acquisitions;   ●  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;   ●  create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;   ●  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;   ●  enter into certain transactions with affiliates;   ●  sell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries’ assets; and   ●  dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person.         18     Table of Contents The restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:  ●  finance our operations;   ●  make needed capital expenditures;   ●  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;   ●  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;   ●  engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and   ●  plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.  A breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. The lender may accelerate the payment terms of the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default set forth therein, which include: the failure of Cohu to make timely payments of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, the failure of Cohu to adhere to the representations and covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the failure to provide notice of any event that causes a material adverse effect or to provide other required notices, upon the event that related collateral agreements become ineffective, upon the event that certain legal judgments are entered against Cohu, the insolvency of Cohu, or upon the change of control of Cohu. Any event that could require us to repay debt prior to its due date could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement. Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business. Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, a material adverse impact on our business from unforeseen events or a desire to reduce our outstanding indebtedness could result in a need to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we could decide to raise capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities, particularly if we pursue additional acquisitions. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.        19     Table of Contents Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and other intangibles comprise 29% of Cohu’s total assets, of which approximately $213.5 million of our total assets are allocated to goodwill. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu’s common stock could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. When Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. There can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods. We are exposed to other risks associated with additional potential acquisitions, investments and divestitures such as integration difficulties, disruption to our core business, dilution of stockholder value, and diversion of management attention. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  ●  acquisitions may underperform and we may not achieve any forecasted growth, benefits or synergies;   ●  difficulties entering potentially new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;   ●  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   ●  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;   ●  the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;   ●  diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;   ●  product manufacturing disruptions and delays as we potentially consolidate certain manufacturing sites;   ●  difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;   ●  the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;   ●  lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   ●  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;   ●  failure to commercialize purchased technology;   ●  the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and   ●  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.  We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      20   Table of Contents Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.  Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to: ●    seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry; ●    timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers; ●    customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries; ●    inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements; ●    inventory write-downs; ●    unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products; ●    inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; ●    geopolitical changes impacting our business, including with respect to China and Taiwan; ●    intangible and deferred tax asset write-downs; and ●    general economic and market conditions, including impacts from sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine, increased inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. In addition, as a result of the Term Loan Credit Facility, we maintain credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). Any downgrades of Cohu’s credit ratings or rating outlooks, if and when they were to occur, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. Cohu’s current credit ratings are considered non-investment grade and make it more costly (as compared to investment grade borrowers) for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. We are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.        21     Table of Contents We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, the price of our common stock has ranged from $51.86 to $8.89. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment industry, our limited backlog, our debt levels, and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. We may underperform relative to our expectations. Our business and financial performance are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as described in these risk factors. We may not achieve our forecasted growth rates, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we expect and may incur losses in the business at any time. Any underperformance from our expectations or forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cause abrupt, significant stock price declines. Also, perceived company underperformance could attract shareholder activism and such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in other short-term focused corporate actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company. We may seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs, to repay outstanding indebtedness under our existing Credit Agreement or to meet our strategic initiatives or operating activities. We have in the past issued common stock as acquisition consideration and for general corporate purposes. For example, in March 2021, we issued 5,692,500 additional shares of our common stock in an underwritten follow-on public offering, an increase of 13.4% of outstanding shares of common stock. We may determine to utilize common stock as acquisition consideration, issue convertible debt, or pursue another follow-on equity offering to raise capital for debt reduction or for other general corporate purposes, at any time in the future. Any issuances of additional shares of our common stock would dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders would have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of equity issuance. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make a takeover of Cohu more difficult. There are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Delaware law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. Cohu’s stock repurchase program may not have an impact that is fully reflected in the current stock valuation. Effective November 2, 2021, a $70 million share repurchase program was authorized by our Board of Directors. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $70 million under the share repurchase program. The stock repurchase program was authorized to potentially offset dilution from equity issuances under Cohu’s equity incentive plans and because the Board believes that, for reasons unrelated to the company’s performance, the trading price of Cohu’s common stock from time to time may not be reflective of the true value of the company. Any repurchases have been and may be made in the future using our existing cash resources. The company gives no assurances as to when, how much and for what duration stock repurchases may be made. However, stock repurchases may adversely affect the company if the economy turns downward, as it could leave the company limited in its ability to obtain cash necessary for ongoing operations or potential acquisition targets. In addition, any repurchase of stock may have no positive impact on our stock price. Further, as stock may be repurchased, given the volatility of our stock price, we may repurchase stock at prices which, in hindsight, are materially higher than the subsequent price of our stock.        22     Table of Contents Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs, modifications to international trade policy, increased duties, tariffs or other export restrictions, public company reporting requirements, climate change and environmental regulation, corporate tax legislation, new employment and privacy laws, and antitrust enforcement. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German, Singaporean, Philippines, and Malaysian subsidiaries have income tax returns currently under routine examination by tax authorities for different periods between 2015 and 2020. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information during our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This has increased our effective tax rate and our cash tax payable in 2022. If the requirement to capitalize Section 174 expenditures is not modified, it may also impact our effective tax rate and our cash tax liability in future years. During December 2022, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) announced that it has reached agreement among its 136-member countries that certain multinational enterprises will be subject to a global minimum tax rate of 15%, also known as Pillar Two. South Korea became the first country to enact such global minimum tax rules, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. These specific actions did not impact our consolidated financial statements in 2022, however, many more countries are expected to issue laws and regulations to conform with this guidance soon. We will continue to monitor the pertinent law changes and regulations to determine the impact they would have on our operating and financial results. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurances that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.        23     Table of Contents In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities, and new laws and regulations (such as involving climate change) or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. In addition, new regulations or shareholder or other public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Intellectual Property and Litigation Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches within our operational systems or products. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We have been impacted by immaterial “phishing” schemes and we are continuing our efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. We believe that the implementation of extensive employee telework practices has increased our cybersecurity risks. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Any future attacks which may disrupt our IT systems, or those of our suppliers, could impact our sales, financial results and stock price. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights and we may incur litigation costs to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We are also subject to the theft and misappropriation of our intellectual property by others, including incidents relating to former employees. Additionally, instances where we identify third parties potentially infringing on our proprietary rights may require our further investigation that could be time-consuming and costly. We believe that our company is taking reasonable actions to protect and continuously improve our security, through strengthened IT infrastructure and internal controls, but if these actions are not successful our business could be adversely affected.        24     Table of Contents Other parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer litigation or licensing costs, and be prohibited from selling our products. We may receive notice from our competitors and third parties regarding patent or copyright claims of potential infringement by our company. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, it may be costly for us to obtain licensing rights, or we may fail to obtain licensing rights or have an inability to license the infringed technology. Additionally, we may not be able to timely acquire or develop similar non-infringing technology, which may require us to change our products or processes. In each of these instances, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. "

Business.  Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (“MEMS”) test modules, test contactors, thermal sub-systems and semiconductor automated test equipment used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by an increase in the number of semiconductor devices that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers. On June 24, 2021, we completed the sale of our PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”) business, which represented our PCB Test reportable segment. As part of the transaction we also sold certain intellectual property held by our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that is utilized by the PCB Test business. Our decision to sell this non-core business resulted from management’s determination that that they were no longer a fit within our organization. We evaluated the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations, and determined that the divestment of our PCB Test business does not represent a strategic shift as the divestiture will not have a major effect on Cohu’s operations and financial results and, as a result, it is not presented as discontinued operations in any periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. We have determined that we have one reportable segment, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”). Prior to the sale of our PCB Test Group (“PTG”) on June 24, 2021, we reported in two segments, Semiconductor Test & Inspection and PCB Test Equipment. Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.             1                 Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:    2021    2020    2019   Semiconductor Test & Inspection   97%  92%  93% PCB Test   3%  8%  7%   100%  100%  100% Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc. Our Products We currently sell the following products: Semiconductor Test. Semiconductor Automated Test Equipment (“ATE”) is used both for wafer level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms focused on the system on a chip (“SoC”) device market. The Diamond series platform, which includes the flagship Diamondx test system, offers high-density instrumentation for low-cost testing of microcontrollers, application specific standard products (“ASSP”), power management, display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx series of testers is focused primarily on the RF Front End IC and Module market. Semiconductor Handlers. Semiconductor test handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobile, industrial, computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, MEMS and thermal sub-systems, along with inspection handlers that perform automated optical inspection of semiconductor devices. Interface Products. Our interface products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues. Data Analytics. Our data analytics product, DI-Core, is a comprehensive software suite used to optimize Cohu equipment performance. DI-Core provides real-time online performance monitoring and process control to improve utilization, manages preventative and predictive maintenance to improve overall equipment efficiency, links semiconductor tester, handler and test contactor data for intelligence and extended device tracking, and provides a knowledge database and unified reports for quickly identifying issues and retaining historical performance data. Spares and Kits. We provide consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customers’ equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We also design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Spares and Kits are included in our recurring revenues. Services. Our worldwide service organization performs installations and necessary maintenance of systems sold. We provide various parts and labor warranties on test and handling systems and instruments designed and manufactured by us and warranties on certain components that have been purchased from other manufacturers and incorporated into our test and handling systems. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of our systems as well as application, data management software and consulting services on our products. Services are included in our recurring revenues.      2                 Sales by Product Line  During the last three years, our consolidated net sales were distributed as follows:    2021    2020    2019   Semiconductor test & inspection systems (including kits)   61%   50%   51%  Recurring revenues (1)   37%   45%   44%  PCB test systems   2%   5%   5% (1) Recurring revenues include interface products, spares, kits (not as part of system sales) and services Customers Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, PCB manufacturers, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:    2021    2020    2019   Analog Devices   14.1%  *   *  Intel   *   *   11.1% * Less than 10% of consolidated net sales.  The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On June 24, 2021, we completed the divestment of our PCB Test business. No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 or December 28, 2019. Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Sales and Marketing We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our United States (U.S.) sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California, St. Paul, Minnesota, Lincoln, Rhode Island and Norwood, Massachusetts. Our European sales offices are located in Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan. Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we believe that we are the leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition in Japan and Taiwan which represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. Test subcontractors in Asia also purchase mostly from local Asian competitors. In the semiconductor test market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world.        3     Table of Contents Backlog Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, by segment at December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was as follows:  (in millions)   2021    2020   Semiconductor Test & Inspection  $292.9  $237.1  PCB Test   N/A   22.4  Total consolidated backlog  $292.9  $259.5  Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contactors); Lincoln, Rhode Island (connectors); and Osaka, Japan (probe pins). We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc.’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, except with regard to end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components which are financed and owned by Cohu. Contracting with a global provider such as Jabil, gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products closer to target markets in Asia, potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times. Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers or may be sole sourced. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers. Patents and Trademarks Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Research and Development Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $92.0 million in 2021, $86.2 million in 2020 and $86.1 million in 2019. We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales.        4     Table of Contents Seasonality Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles. See the risk factor entitled “The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin.” Information About Our Executive Officers The following sets forth the names, ages, positions and offices held by all executive officers of Cohu as of February 10, 2022.

Additional risks that we currently do not know about, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations or the trading price of our common stock. Risk Factors
 Summary Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the full “Risk Factors
” described below and should not be relied upon as a complete summary of the material risks facing our business. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic   ●  The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.    ●  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to negatively impact, the operations of our key suppliers, customers and other business partners.  Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry   ●  We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful.    ●  We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.    ●  A failure to perform or unexpected downtime experienced by our sole contract manufacturer for certain semiconductor automated test equipment could adversely impact our operations.    ●  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.    ●  We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, components and subassemblies, labor and distribution costs, which may impact our financial condition or results of operations.    ●  The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin.    ●  The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive.    ●  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.    ●  The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.    ●  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.    ●  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler and automated test equipment suppliers.         9     Table of Contents Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business   ●  We are exposed to the risks of operating in certain foreign locations from where Cohu manufactures certain products, and supports our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry.    ●  Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm and limit Cohu’s business and ability to sell its products.  Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital   ●  The remaining indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.  Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions   ●  We are exposed to other risks associated with additional potential acquisitions, investments and divestitures such as integration difficulties, disruption to our core business, dilution of stockholder value, and diversion of management attention.  Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock   ●  Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.    ●  We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.  Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters   ●  There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States.  Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Intellectual Property and Litigation   ●  Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches within our operational systems or products.  For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly and globally, from March 2020 and continuing to the present, with subsequent variants emerging, authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates, and shutdowns, including at various times in all of the jurisdictions where we operate. These measures have adversely impacted, and are continuing to adversely impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, Japan and the Philippines, and each of these countries has been significantly affected, and remain affected, by the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been common for restrictions to be implemented, relaxed and then implemented again with little or no notice, which adversely impacts our ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses and is disruptive to our operations.        10     Table of Contents Although we believe that Cohu qualifies as an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our business has been, and is continuing to be, adversely impacted by evolving and extended public health requirements around the world; government-mandated facility shutdowns; import/export, shipping and logistics disruptions and delays; other supply chain and distribution constraints or delays; rapid changes to business, political or regulatory conditions affecting the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall global economy; availability of employees, increased sick time and lost employee productivity; risks associated with, at times, temporarily housing employees in our Malaysia and Philippines factories; remote working IT and increased cybersecurity risks; increased internal control risks over financial reporting as key finance staff work remotely; delayed product development programs; customers’ canceling, pushing out orders or refusal to accept product deliveries; delayed collection of receivables; other actions of our customers, suppliers and competitors which may be sudden and inconsistent with our expectations; higher shipping, trucking and logistics costs; higher component costs; manufacturing capacity limitations; additional credit rating agency downgrades could occur which would increase our cost of raising capital; and potential additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or inventory write-downs due to lower product demand may become necessary. Any of the foregoing COVID-19 driven impacts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in these risk factors. With each successive COVID-19 surge, we believe the risks of material adverse business disruption increase. We continuously monitor and react to the pandemic but cannot predict its future course or impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to negatively impact, the operations of our key suppliers, customers, and other business partners. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the operations of our critical suppliers, business partners and customers could result in disruptions to our global supply chains. We may obtain certain components and materials used in our products from a limited group of suppliers, and in some cases alternative sources for certain components are not readily available. We have had certain suppliers temporarily suspend operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and have been able to work around such disruptions; however, we may not be successful in addressing future disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the risks posed by our dependence upon sole or limited source suppliers to the extent that the pandemic could disrupt the operations of one or more of these suppliers, potentially impacting our suppliers’ ability to maintain manufacturing operations at existing levels, and resulting in our inability to adequately obtain key components or materials, causing delayed deliveries or unsatisfactory component quality for our customers as we look to engage and qualify alternative suppliers (see risk factor entitled “Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations”). Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful. Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new and enhanced product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace and to enter new markets. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs relating to test contactors, test handlers and automated test equipment. For example, in fiscal 2021, we incurred $92.0 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may, at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings and product enhancements can have a negative impact on our operating results. We have in the past made material investments in new product platforms that for various reasons, such as technical challenges or lack of customer adoption, have not generated the expected sales or return. There can be no assurance that other new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. A substantial majority of our products are manufactured in Asia. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or logistics, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management and logistics. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factors entitled “The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, corruption and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.        11     Table of Contents Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our manufacturing and our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A failure to perform or unexpected downtime experienced by our sole contract manufacturer for certain semiconductor test systems could adversely impact our operations. We depend upon Jabil Manufacturing Co, (“Jabil”) to manufacture most of our semiconductor test systems from its facility located in Malaysia. In the event that Jabil was unable to meet Cohu’s current delivery schedule for semiconductor test systems, or if Jabil experienced unexpected downtime, we may not be able to sell, or have significant delays, in fulfilling our customer orders. If we experienced significant delays or disruptions with Jabil, it would take us significant time to ramp up a new manufacturer for our semiconductor test products, either in-house or with another contract manufacturer. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. For example, at the beginning of 2022, we are experiencing supply constraints and delays in accessing certain specialty semiconductors necessary for the production of test instruments for our semiconductor ATE products. If we cannot quickly resolve these constraints, our revenue and overall gross margin will be adversely impacted beginning in first quarter 2022. More broadly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, components and subassemblies, labor and distribution costs, which may impact our financial condition or results of operations. As a global manufacturer, we rely on raw materials, packaging materials, direct labor, energy, a large network of suppliers, distribution resources and transportation providers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, components and subassemblies, transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have increased. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a dramatic increase in freight and shipping costs. The foregoing price fluctuations are driven by factors beyond our control. Although we are unable to predict the longer-term impacts, we expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022. Attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through product price increases, or attempting to reduce operating costs elsewhere, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Customers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may purchase lower-priced competitive offerings or may delay some purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not otherwise offset, and/or if they result in decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.        12     Table of Contents The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, including the level of product sales and overall gross margin, and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $7.1 million, $6.0 million, and $4.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. We saw weakness in market conditions in 2019, followed by COVID-19 driven uncertainties in 2020, then a significant market recovery beginning in third quarter 2020. Abrupt, unexpected and severe demand changes have occurred in the past and are expected to reoccur in the future within our industry. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, we have seen demand fluctuations in our test handler group (“THG”) and semiconductor test group (“STG”) businesses. Our recent sales, in particular during the second and third quarters of 2021, became more weighted toward THG and less toward STG products, which had a material negative impact on our gross margins. Although the company continues to take actions to reduce expenses and improve overall operational efficiency, such actions may not be sufficient to fully offset any gross margin impacts. We cannot predict when and to what extent sales among our businesses may normalize or change in the future, or when and to what extent gross margins may improve in the future. The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive. The industries we serve are intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. In addition, there are emerging companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. We have increased investments in our test contactor business and targeted significant growth opportunities. However, the test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high localized customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to continue to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our test contactor operating results and impede us from achieving our test contactor sales goals. In addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered the automated test equipment (“ATE”) market. Our ability to increase ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to win new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, which is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. We also believe that our niche position results in greater sales cyclicality versus larger more diversified ATE vendors and Cohu experienced such adverse cyclicality in 2021. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.        13     Table of Contents Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2021. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of test handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.        14     Table of Contents The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, and with training and recruiting large numbers of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to timely or successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Sudden demand changes in business conditions, positive or negative, are common in our industry but the timing of such changes is very difficult to predict. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. For fiscal year 2021, net revenue from our ten largest customers represented 57% of our total net revenue. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Also, consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products, which could cause a decline in our revenues. With consolidation, the number of actual and potential customers for our products has decreased in recent years. Consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer, and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power. We expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler and automated test equipment suppliers. The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market (see risk factor “Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition”). In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, a willingness to compete solely on price, favorable tariffs and other government preferences, and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture, market and support products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. Our customers’ selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant sales, service and engineering resources, and to provide the customer evaluation systems for several months at no charge, in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring such expenditures. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales.        15     Table of Contents In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs. In addition, if any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation, which could make it more difficult to sell our products. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Kolbermoor, Germany; La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risks that our executives and other key employees may be suddenly unable to perform their duties due to health or other personal responsibilities. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business We are exposed to the risks of operating in certain foreign locations where Cohu manufactures certain products and supports our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products and support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry. As such, we face risks in doing business globally. For example, while our corporate headquarters are located in California, additional key engineering, sales, and administrative personnel are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere in the U.S., and our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and the U.S. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  ●  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in, or interpretations of, requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;   ●  trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;   ●  compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;   ●  complex labor laws and privacy regulations;   ●  difficulties in adequately supervising employees widely distributed around the world (including due to implementing remote work arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic);   ●  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   ●  longer payment cycles and receivable collections;         16     Table of Contents  ●  health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;   ●  local and global political and economic conditions, including ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications;   ●  natural disasters and other climate risks and geopolitical instability;   ●  varied environmental laws and regulations at each of our principal locations;   ●  complex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and   ●  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.  Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not sell to consumers nor process individual credit card information, but do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the recently effective California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs. If one or more of these risks occurs, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial results will suffer. Geopolitical instability in locations critical to Cohu and its customers’ business, manufacturing, and engineering operations may adversely impact our operations and sales. An increase in geopolitical tensions in Asia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, could disrupt existing semiconductor chip manufacturing and increase the prospect of an interruption to the semiconductor chip supply across the world. A setback to the current state of relative peace and stability in the region could compromise existing semiconductor chip production and have downstream implications for our company. The world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer is located in Taiwan and is a top supplier for many U.S. companies, many of which are part of the company’s customer base. Further, recent geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia could adversely impact the supply chain in this region, particularly with respect to critical materials and metals, such as palladium which is used in our interface products as well as in semiconductors. Any interruption to semiconductor chip supply and its related impact to the company’s customers, or any disruption in our supply chain, could result in an adverse impact to our financial results. Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and exchange rates, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial conditions that we currently cannot predict.  In fiscal year 2021, 91% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan. Given our extensive global operations, we are subject to immediate impacts from any changing tariff or export regulations (see risk factor entitled “Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm Cohu’s business and ability to sell its products without limitations”). It remains our plan to continue our international growth. We have business operations within the jurisdictions listed above, and while we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we incur certain costs in other currencies. As a result, the company holds exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings, despite actions we take to minimize those currency exposures. Additionally, engaging in foreign currency contracts to minimize such currency exposure could result in additional costs and risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.      17                 The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters are located in Singapore and Taiwan, and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. Although we believe that we carry reasonable and appropriate business insurance, we may not be insured for certain losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have very limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. Our business could also be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, and has been and is continuing to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic (see risk factor entitled “The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations”). Our business could be materially and adversely affected by climate change and related matters. We analyze climate change risks in two separate categories: transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are those risks relating to the transition of the global economy to a focus on more climate-friendly technologies. This transition could have adverse financial impacts on us in several ways. For instance, more stringent environmental policies or regulations could lead to increased expenses relating to green-house gas emissions or other emissions that could increase our operating costs. Enhanced emissions-reporting or shifting technology could require us to write off or impair assets or retire existing assets early. Increased environmental mandates could also increase our exposure to litigation. We could be required to incur increased costs and significant capital investment to transition to lower emissions technologies. In addition, overall market shifts could increase costs of our raw materials and cause unexpected shifts in energy costs. Focus on sustainability has increased, and the company or its industry could be stigmatized as not friendly to the environment, which could adversely affect our reputation and our business, including due to difficulties in employee hiring and retention and our ability to access capital. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Physical risks from climate change that could affect our business include acute weather events such as floods, tornadoes or other severe weather and ongoing changes such as rising temperatures or extreme variability in weather patterns. These events could lead to increased capital costs from damage to our facilities, increased insurance premiums or reduced revenue from decreased production capacity based on supply chain interruptions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations (see risk factor entitled “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). Increasingly restrictive trade and export regulations may materially harm and limit Cohu’s business and ability to sell its products. There have been significant changes in U.S. export regulations relating to China since 2019. Such changes included restrictions on exports to certain China-domiciled entities including Huawei and broader definitions and restrictions on “military end users” and “uses.” Despite an ongoing material adverse impact on direct and indirect Huawei sales, we have not seen any overall material impact to our business from the foregoing restrictions. However, we believe that these collective export restrictions and the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations have encouraged China-based companies to actively seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our foreign competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to China-based companies. Recent history indicates that the U.S. government may impose other new export restrictions, or tariffs, and have done so within the past year as the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security has included additional China-based entities to its restricted entities list. Such ongoing restrictions with little or no prior notice will impact our ability (or our customers’ ability) to sell and ship products to China-based companies and any such additional restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.      18                 Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital The remaining indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense. In connection with the Xcerra acquisition in 2018, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the “Debt Financing” or “Credit Agreement”). The remaining indebtedness of approximately $103 million may reduce Cohu’s liquidity and cause Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu’s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu’s cash flow for working capital and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans. The Federal Reserve has signaled its intention to raise interest rates in 2022, and with a variable interest rate on its remaining indebtedness, Cohu would incur an increase in interest expenses. In addition, our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations. In 2021, Cohu continued to take steps to reduce outstanding principal under its Debt Financing; however, Cohu gives no assurance as to if, when or how much any subsequent voluntary principal reductions may be. If we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our Credit Agreement, we would be in default under the agreement. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act temporarily increased this limitation to 50% for 2019 and 2020. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and 2019. We were able to fully deduct the interest expense in 2020 plus the disallowed amounts carried over from 2018 and 2019, however, the Tax Acts may continue to impact our ability to utilize future deductions. Our Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:  ●  incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;   ●  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;   ●  pay cash dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;   ●  enter into rate, commodity, equity or currency swap, hedging or other similar transactions;   ●  make loans, investments or acquisitions;   ●  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;   ●  create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;   ●  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;   ●  enter into certain transactions with affiliates;   ●  sell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries’ assets; and   ●  dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person.  The restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:  ●  finance our operations;   ●  make needed capital expenditures;   ●  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;   ●  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;   ●  engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and   ●  plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.         19     Table of Contents A breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. The lender may accelerate the payment terms of the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default set forth therein, which include: the failure of Cohu to make timely payments of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, the failure of Cohu to adhere to the representations and covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the failure to provide notice of any event that causes a material adverse effect or to provide other required notices, upon the event that related collateral agreements become ineffective, upon the event that certain legal judgments are entered against Cohu, the insolvency of Cohu, or upon the change of control of Cohu. Any event that could require us to repay debt prior to its due date could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement. Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business. Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, a material adverse impact on our business from unforeseen events or a desire to reduce our outstanding indebtedness could result in a need to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we could decide to raise capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities, particularly if we pursue additional acquisitions. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. Cohu accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. 32% of Cohu’s total assets is comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $219.8 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu’s common stock could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Xcerra acquisition, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. For example, in 2020 and 2021, Cohu recorded impairment charges of approximately $11.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, to adjust in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) assets obtained in the acquisition of Xcerra to their current fair value. There can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods.        20     Table of Contents We are exposed to other risks associated with additional potential acquisitions, investments and divestitures such as integration difficulties, disruption to our core business, dilution of stockholder value, and diversion of management attention. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  ●  acquisitions may underperform and we may not achieve any forecasted growth, benefits or synergies;   ●  difficulties entering potentially new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;   ●  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   ●  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;   ●  the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;   ●  diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;   ●  product manufacturing disruptions and delays as we potentially consolidate certain manufacturing sites;   ●  difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;   ●  the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;   ●  lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   ●  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;   ●  failure to commercialize purchased technology;   ●  the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and   ●  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.  We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      21                 Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.  Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  ●  seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;   ●  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   ●  customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;   ●  inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   ●  inventory write-downs;   ●  unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;   ●  inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers;   ●  intangible and deferred tax asset write-downs; and   ●  general economic and market conditions, including the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. In addition, as a result of the Term Loan Credit Facility, we maintain credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). Any downgrades of Cohu’s credit ratings or rating outlooks, if and when they were to occur, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. Cohu’s current credit ratings are considered non-investment grade and make it more costly (as compared to investment grade borrowers) for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. We are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.        22     Table of Contents We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 25, 2021, the price of our common stock has ranged from $51.86 to $8.89. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment industry, our limited backlog, our debt levels, and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. We may underperform relative to our expectations. Our business and financial performance are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as described in these risk factors. We may not achieve our forecasted growth rates, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we expect and may incur losses in the business at any time. Any underperformance from our expectations or forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cause abrupt, significant stock price declines. Also, perceived company underperformance could attract shareholder activism and such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in other short-term focused corporate actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company. We may seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs, to repay outstanding indebtedness under our existing Credit Agreement or to meet our strategic initiatives or operating activities. We have in the past issued common stock as acquisition consideration and for general corporate purposes. For example, most recently, in March 2021, we issued 5,692,500 additional shares of our common stock in an underwritten follow-on public offering, an increase of 13.4% of outstanding shares of common stock. We may determine to utilize common stock as acquisition consideration, issue convertible debt, or pursue another follow-on equity offering to raise capital for debt reduction or for other general corporate purposes, at any time in the future. Any issuances of additional shares of our common stock would dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders would have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of equity issuance. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make a takeover of Cohu more difficult. There are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Delaware law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. Cohu’s stock repurchase program may not have an impact that is fully reflected in the current stock valuation. Effective November 2, 2021, a $70 million share repurchase program was authorized by our Board of Directors. The stock repurchase program was authorized to potentially offset dilution from equity issuances under Cohu’s equity incentive plans and because the Board believes that, for reasons unrelated to the company’s performance, the trading price of Cohu’s common stock from time to time may not be reflective of the true value of the company. Any repurchases have been and may be made in the future using our existing cash resources. The company gives no assurances as to when, how much and for what duration stock repurchases may be made. However, stock repurchases may adversely affect the company if the economy turns downward, due to the existing COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, as it could leave the company limited in its ability to obtain cash necessary for ongoing operations or potential acquisition targets. Further, as stock may be repurchased, given the volatility of our stock price, we may repurchase stock at prices which, in hindsight, are materially higher than the subsequent price of our stock.      23                 Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs, modifications to international trade policy, increased duties, tariffs or other export restrictions, public company reporting requirements, climate change and environmental regulation, corporate tax legislation, new employment and privacy laws, and antitrust enforcement. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German subsidiaries income tax returns for 2015 to 2017, and our Philippines subsidiary income tax return for 2017 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in their respective countries. During 2021, we were notified by the taxing authority in Malaysia of its intent to perform an audit for 2014 to 2019 for one of our Malaysian subsidiaries. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Xcerra, a greater than 50% cumulative ownership change in Xcerra triggered a significant limitation in the utilization of their net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. Cohu’s ability to use the acquired Xcerra U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations as defined in sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurances that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.        24     Table of Contents Any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities, and new laws and regulations (such as involving climate change) or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. In addition, new regulations or shareholder or other public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Intellectual Property and Litigation Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches within our operational systems or products. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We have been impacted by immaterial “phishing” schemes and we are continuing our efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. We believe that extensive employee telework practices, implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased our cybersecurity risks. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Any future attacks, similar to the “SolarWinds” hack that occurred in 2020, which may disrupt our IT systems, or those of our suppliers, could impact our sales, financial results and stock price. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights and we may incur litigation costs to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We are also subject to the theft and misappropriation of our intellectual property by others, including incidents relating to former employees. Additionally, instances where we identify third parties potentially infringing on our proprietary rights may require our further investigation that could be time-consuming and costly. We believe that our company is taking reasonable actions to protect and continuously improve our security, through strengthened IT infrastructure and internal controls, but if these actions are not successful our business could be adversely affected. Other parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer litigation or licensing costs, and be prohibited from selling our products. We may receive notice from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims of potential infringement by our company. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, it may be costly for us to obtain licensing rights, or we may fail to obtain licensing rights or have an inability to license the infringed technology. Additionally, we may not be able to timely acquire or develop similar non-infringing technology, which may require us to change our products or processes. In each of these instances, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.        25     Table of Contents "

The forward-looking statements include statements concerning, among other things, our business strategy (including the influence of anticipated trends and developments in our business and the markets in which we operate), financial results, operating results, revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, products, projected costs and capital expenditures, research and development programs, sales and marketing initiatives, acquisitions and competition. In some cases, you can identify these statements by our use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “intend” and “continue,” the negative or plural of these words and other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our current expectations about future events, which are inherently subject to change and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We have no obligation to update any of these statements, and we assume no obligation to do so. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors, including but not limited to the matters discussed below in the section entitled “Item 1A: Risk Factors
,” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. PART I Item 1. Business.  Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors, thermal sub-systems, semiconductor automated test equipment and bare board PCB test systems used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by an increase in the number of semiconductor devices and PCBs that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers. On October 1, 2018, we acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”), a Massachusetts-based company. Xcerra, formerly known as LTX-Credence Corporation, is a global provider of test and handling capital equipment, interface products and related services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries. Xcerra operated in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing test markets through its atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies (ECT), LTX-Credence and Multitest businesses. The acquisition of Xcerra extended Cohu’s market position in the test handler and test contactor markets and expanded Cohu’s addressable market with our entry into semiconductor automated test equipment (ATE) and bare board PCB test. The results of Xcerra’s operations have been included in our consolidated results since October 1, 2018. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, our fiscal 2020 and 2019 results include Xcerra for the entire year whereas fiscal 2018 amounts only include Xcerra for the three months ended December 29, 2018. This acquisition helped transform our business into a broader semiconductor test, inspection and test handling market leader with greater scale, diversification and market opportunities. Management previously determined that Xcerra’s fixtures services business did not align with Cohu’s long-term strategic plan and engaged in a process to divest this portion of the business. As a result, as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the assets of our fixtures business are considered “held for sale” and the operations of our fixtures business were presented as “discontinued operations”. This business was sold in February 2020. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. We have determined that we have two reportable segments, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”) and PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”). Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.        1     Table of Contents Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:    2020    2019    2018   Semiconductor Test & Inspection   92%   93%   98%  PCB Test   8%   7%   2%    100%   100%   100%  Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc. Our Products We currently sell the following products: Semiconductor Test. Semiconductor ATE (Automated Test Equipment) is used both for wafer level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms focused on the system on a chip (SoC) device market. The Diamond series platform, which includes the flagship Diamondx test system, offers high-density instrumentation for low-cost testing of microcontrollers, application specific standard products (ASSP), power management, display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx series of testers is focused primarily on the RF Front End IC and Module market. Semiconductor Handlers. Semiconductor test handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobile, industrial, computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, MEMS and thermal sub-systems, along with inspection handlers that perform automated optical inspection of semiconductor devices. Interface Products. Our interface products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues. Spares and Kits. We provide consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customers’ equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We also design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Spares and Kits are included in our recurring revenues. Services. Our worldwide service organization performs installations and necessary maintenance of systems sold. We provide various parts and labor warranties on test and handling systems and instruments designed and manufactured by us and warranties on certain components that have been purchased from other manufacturers and incorporated into our test and handling systems. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of our systems as well as application, data management software and consulting services on our products. Our InSight test cell enterprise software platform provides our customers with a centralized data management system to monitor equipment performance. Services are included in our recurring revenues. Bare Board PCB Test Systems. Bare board PCB test systems are used to test pre-assembly printed circuit boards. Our PCB test systems include flying probe testers, which are used to test low-volume, highly complex circuit boards and do not require the use of a separate test fixture, as well as universal grid testers, which require the use of a custom test fixture and are well-suited for circuit boards in high volume manufacturing.        2     Table of Contents Sales by Product Line  During the last three years, our consolidated net sales were distributed as follows:    2020    2019    2018   Semiconductor test & inspection systems (including kits)   50%   51%   55%  Interface products, spares, kits (not as part of systems sales) and services   45%   44%   43%  PCB test systems   5%   5%   2%  Customers Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, PCB manufacturers, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:   2020  2019  2018  Intel   *   11.1%  *   *No single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 29, 2018.  No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 or December 29, 2018. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Sales and Marketing We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our United States, (U.S.) sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California, Lincoln, Rhode Island and Norwood, Massachusetts. Our European sales offices are located in Wertheim and Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan. Competition The semiconductor equipment and PCB test industries are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we believe that we are the leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition in Japan and Taiwan which represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. Test subcontractors in Asia also purchase mostly from local Asian competitors. In the semiconductor test market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. Further, the PCB test industry is characterized by significant Asia-based competition and intense price competition. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world.        3     Table of Contents Backlog Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, by segment at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was as follows:  (in millions)   2020    2019   Semiconductor Test & Inspection  $237.1  $149.9  PCB Test   22.4   10.5  Total consolidated backlog  $259.5  $160.4  Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contactors); Lincoln, Rhode Island (connectors); Osaka, Japan (probe pins); and Wertheim, Germany (bare board PCB test systems). We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, except with regard to end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components which are financed and owned by Cohu. Contracting with a global provider such as Jabil, gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products closer to target markets in Asia, potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times. Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers. Patents and Trademarks Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Research and Development Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $86.2 million in 2020, $86.1 million in 2019 and $56.4 million in 2018. The increase in research and development expense in 2019 was primarily associated with the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018. Incremental research and development expense directly attributed to Xcerra in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $44.2 million, $45.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively.        4     Table of Contents We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales. Seasonality Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.” Executive Officers of the Registrant The following sets forth the names, ages, positions and offices held by all executive officers of Cohu as of February 18, 2021.

Cohu is committed to respecting and protecting all human rights including those of women and minority groups. Employees As of December 26, 2020, we had approximately 3,250 employees, including approximately 100 temporary employees, in 25 countries. Approximately 22% of our employees are located in the Americas, 19% are located in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and 59% are located in China and Asia Pacific. Our employee headcount has fluctuated in the last five years primarily due to the volatile and unpredictable business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry and has also been impacted by acquisitions and divestitures.        6     Table of Contents Management Engagement Practices We adhere to our core values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with a commitment to treating our employees and all our partners with professionalism, dignity and respect. We pride ourselves at fostering an innovative environment and collaborative work relationships. This includes respecting principles of freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining in accordance with applicable laws. Our employees in the U.S. and most locations in Asia are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, certain employees at our operations in Germany are represented by works councils and employees in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland are members of the microtechnology and Swiss watch trade union. The Collective Bargaining Agreement of “Metallurgie (ingenieurs et cadres)” is applicable to all employees of our French subsidiary and certain employees in our China operation belong to local trade unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. Health and Safety The health and safety of our employees is of utmost important to us. Cohu works to protect the health and safety of employees and our customers and intends to conduct all business activities in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We encourage and strive to have every employee actively champion those behaviors and the attitudes necessary to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses, property damage, and adverse impact to the environment. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. During fiscal 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, our subcontractors and our customers. These protocols include complying with social distancing, enhanced hygiene and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, and taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including most of our workforce working remotely. Compensation and Benefits Cohu is committed to providing market competitive compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate a high performing workforce critical to our long-term success. As part of our compensation philosophy, we focus Cohu’s workforce on our financial and other business goals to drive and motivate employee performance in key areas through the administration of our management incentive plan, equity incentive plan, global profit-sharing and other local bonus plans, as may be applicable to a given position.

. In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating Cohu and our business (the “risk factors”). Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. If any of the identified risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations or the trading price of our common stock. Risk Factors
 Summary Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Factors
” described below and should not be relied upon as a complete summary of the material risks facing our business. Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry   ●  The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.    ●  We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful.    ●  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.    ●  We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.    ●  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.    ●  The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.    ●  The semiconductor equipment and printed circuit board (“PCB”) test industries are intensely competitive.    ●  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.    ●  The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.    ●  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.    ●  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test suppliers.  Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital   ●  The incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.    ●  Our Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to enter into financing and other transactions relating to our assets.    ●  Cohu has total consolidated debt of $319.9 million as of December 26, 2020 and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.         9     Table of Contents   ●  The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company.  Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions   ●  We are exposed to other risks associated with other acquisitions, investments and divestitures.    ●  We expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of non-core assets.  Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock   ●  Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.  Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters   ●  Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition.  Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, the Economy, and Litigation   ●  Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.  For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below. Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly and globally, from March 2020 and continuing to the present, authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, including in all of the jurisdictions where we operate. These measures have adversely impacted, and are continuing to adversely impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, Japan and the Philippines, and each of these countries has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been common for restrictions to be implemented, relaxed and then implemented again with little or no notice, which adversely impacts our ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses and is disruptive to our operations. Although we believe that Cohu qualifies as an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our business has been, and is continuing to be, adversely impacted by evolving and extended public health requirements around the world; government-mandated facility shutdowns; import/export, shipping and logistics disruptions and delays; other supply chain and distribution constraints or delays; rapid changes to business, political or regulatory conditions affecting the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall global economy; availability of employees and lost employee productivity; risks associated with, at times, temporarily housing employees in our Malaysia and Philippines factories; remote working IT and increased cybersecurity risks; increased internal control risks over financial reporting as key finance staff work remotely; delayed product development programs; customers’ canceling, pushing out orders or refusal to accept product deliveries; delayed collection of receivables; other actions of our customers, suppliers and competitors which may be sudden and inconsistent with our expectations; higher shipping and logistics costs; higher component costs; manufacturing capacity limitations; additional credit rating agency downgrades could occur which would increase our cost of raising capital; and potential additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or inventory write-downs due to lower product demand may become necessary. Any of the foregoing COVID-19 driven impacts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in these risk factors. We continuously monitor the pandemic but cannot predict its future course or impacts.        10     Table of Contents We are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful. Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new and enhanced product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace and to enter new markets. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs relating to test contactors, test handlers and automated test equipment. For example, in fiscal 2020, we incurred $86.2 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may, at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings and product enhancements can have a negative impact on our operating results. We have in the past made material investments in new product platforms that for various reasons, such as technical challenges or lack of customer adoption, have not generated the expected sales or return. There can be no assurance that other new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business. We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. For example, while our corporate headquarters are located in California, additional key engineering, sales, and administrative personnel are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere in the U.S., and our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and the U.S. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  ●  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;   ●  trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;   ●  compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;   ●  complex labor laws and privacy regulations;   ●  difficulties in adequately supervising employees widely distributed around the world (including due to implementing remote work arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic);   ●  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   ●  longer payment cycles;   ●  health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;   ●  local and global political and economic conditions, including ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications;   ●  natural disasters and geopolitical instability;   ●  varied environmental laws and regulations at each of our principal locations;   ●  complex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and   ●  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.  Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.        11     Table of Contents We continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not sell to consumers nor process individual credit card information, but do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the recently effective California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs. If one or more of these risks occurs, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial results will suffer. We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. A substantial majority of our products are manufactured in Asia. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or logistics, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management and logistics. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factors entitled “The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, corruption and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales”). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our manufacturing and our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $6.0 million, $4.1 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. We saw weakness in market conditions in 2019, followed by COVID-19 driven uncertainties in 2020, then a significant market recovery beginning in third quarter 2020. Abrupt, unexpected and severe demand changes have occurred in the past and are expected to reoccur in the future within our industry.        12     Table of Contents The semiconductor equipment and PCB test industries are intensely competitive. The industries we serve are intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Similarly, the PCB test industry is characterized by significant Asia-based competition and intense price competition. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. We have increased investments in our test contactor business and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years, but due to weak market conditions we did not achieve our growth goals in 2019 and 2020. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high localized customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our test contactor operating results and impede us from achieving our test contactor sales goals. In addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered the automated test equipment (“ATE”) market. Our ability to increase our ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets. Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2020. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.        13     Table of Contents The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of test handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Sudden demand changes (as, for example, we experienced in 2019 and 2020) in business conditions, positive or negative, are common in our industry but the timing of such changes is very difficult to predict. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. For fiscal year 2020, net revenue from our ten largest customers represented 47% of our total net revenue. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Also, consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products, which could cause a decline in our revenues. With consolidation, the number of actual and potential customers for our products has decreased in recent years. Consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer, and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power.        14     Table of Contents We expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test suppliers. The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market (see risk factor “Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition”). In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, a willingness to compete solely on price, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture, market and support products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. Our customers’ selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant sales, service and engineering resources, and regularly to provide the customer evaluation systems for several months at no charge, in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring such expenditures. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs. In addition, if any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation, which could make it more difficult to sell our products. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.        15     Table of Contents Our global Enterprise Resource Management (“ERP”) upgrade may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. We are in final development stages of a phased global replacement of our existing ERP solution and launched the first phase of such new ERP solution in first and fourth quarter 2020. The second phase and rollout is planned throughout 2021. The new solution is being developed as an enterprise solution in partnership with a leading provider of ERP tools. Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business. These implementations are extremely complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could result in the loss or corruption of data, delayed order processing and shipments and increased costs. It could also adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Kolbermoor and Wertheim, Germany; La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risks that our executives and other key employees may be suddenly unable to perform their duties due to health or other personal responsibilities. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are also subject to the theft and misappropriation of intellectual property by others, including incidents relating to former employees. We believe we are taking reasonable actions to protect and improve our security, through strengthened IT infrastructure and internal controls, but if these actions are not successful our business could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital The incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. In connection with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the “Debt Financing” or “Credit Agreement”). Such indebtedness has reduced Cohu’s liquidity and has caused Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu’s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu’s cash flow for working capital and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans. In addition, our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations. During the second half of 2020, Cohu took action to reduce outstanding principal under its Debt Financing; however, Cohu gives no future assurance as to if, when or how much any subsequent voluntary principal reductions may be. If we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our Credit Agreement, we would be in default under the agreement.        16     Table of Contents Our Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:  ●  incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;   ●  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;   ●  pay cash dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;   ●  enter into rate, commodity, equity or currency swap, hedging or other similar transactions;   ●  make loans, investments or acquisitions;   ●  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;   ●  create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;   ●  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;   ●  enter into certain transactions with affiliates;   ●  sell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries’ assets; and   ●  dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person.  The restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:  ●  finance our operations;   ●  make needed capital expenditures;   ●  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;   ●  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;   ●  engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and   ●  plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.  A breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. The lender may accelerate the payment terms of the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default set forth therein, which include: the failure of Cohu to make timely payments of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, the failure of Cohu to adhere to the representations and covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the failure to provide notice of any event that causes a material adverse effect or to provide other required notices, upon the event that related collateral agreements become ineffective, upon the event that certain legal judgments are entered against Cohu, the insolvency of Cohu, or upon the change of control of Cohu. Any event that could require us to repay debt prior to its due date could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement.        17     Table of Contents Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates. Interest rates under our Credit Agreement are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate must be negotiated and agreed among the Administrative Agent, Cohu and certain lenders under the Credit Agreement. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Cohu has total consolidated debt of $319.9 million as of December 26, 2020 and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense. Cohu’s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the Debt Financing agreements will depend on Cohu’s future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of Cohu’s products, pressure from competitors, new product innovation and overall business execution. In addition, Cohu is subject to interest rate risks, and continuing increases in interest rates will increase Cohu’s debt service obligations. If Cohu is ever unable to meet its debt service obligations or fail to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, Cohu may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue Cohu Common Stock or other equity securities. Cohu may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to Cohu, in amounts sufficient to meet Cohu’s needs or at all. If Cohu is able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to Cohu’s stockholders. Cohu’s inability to service its debt obligations or refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. In addition, Cohu’s debt obligations may limit its ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act"") limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (""CARES"") Act temporarily increased this limitation to 50% for 2019 and 2020. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and 2019. We were able to fully deduct the interest expense in 2020 plus the disallowed amounts carried over from 2018 and 2019, however, the Tax Acts may continue to impact our ability to utilize future deductions. Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business. Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, a material adverse impact from COVID-19 or a desire to reduce our outstanding indebtedness could result in a need to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we could decide to raise capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities, particularly if we pursue additional acquisitions. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are significantly limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.        18     Table of Contents The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company. We may seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs, to repay outstanding indebtedness under our existing Credit Agreement or to meet our strategic initiatives or operating activities. We have in the past issued common stock as acquisition consideration. For example, the Xcerra acquisition was financed in part by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to shareholders of Xcerra, comprising approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the transaction. We may determine to utilize common stock as acquisition consideration, issue convertible debt, or pursue a follow-on equity offering to raise capital for debt reduction or for other general corporate purposes, at any time in the future. Any issuances of additional shares of our common stock would dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders would have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of equity issuance. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Risks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. Cohu accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. 45% of Cohu’s total assets is comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $252.3 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu’s common stock could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Xcerra acquisition, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. For example, in first quarter 2020, and again in third quarter 2020, Cohu recorded impairment charges of approximately $3.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, to adjust in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) assets obtained in the acquisition of Xcerra to their current fair value. There can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods. We are exposed to other risks associated with other acquisitions, investments and divestitures. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. For example, we acquired Xcerra Corporation in 2018 for total consideration of approximately $794.4 million. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  ●  acquisitions may underperform and we may not achieve any forecasted growth, benefits or synergies;   ●  difficulties entering potentially new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;         19     Table of Contents  ●  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   ●  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;   ●  the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;   ●  diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;   ●  product manufacturing disruptions and delays as we potentially consolidate certain manufacturing sites;   ●  difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;   ●  the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;   ●  lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   ●  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;   ●  failure to commercialize purchased technology;   ●  the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and   ●  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.  We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. For example, the Xcerra acquisition resulted in significant dilution as it was financed, in part, by the issuance of approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the transaction. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of non-core assets Further, as a strategy to pay down our long-term debt, we expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of assets that management determines to be non-core to our overall business strategy. Any such divestitures may distract Cohu’s management team, disrupt employees, may not yield attractive valuations, may incur material restructuring and transaction expenses and tax obligations, and may otherwise be unsuccessful. Divestitures may also involve warranties, indemnification or covenants that could restrict our business or result in litigation, additional expenses or liabilities. In addition, discontinuing product categories, even categories that we consider non-strategic, reduces the size and diversification of our business and causes us to be more dependent on a smaller number of product categories. Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.  Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  ●  seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;   ●  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   ●  customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;   ●  inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;         20     Table of Contents  ●  inventory write-downs;   ●  unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;   ●  inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers;   ●  intangible and deferred tax asset write-downs; and   ●  general economic and market conditions, including the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. In addition, as a result of the Credit Facility, we maintain credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). The current Moody’s and S&P issuer credit ratings for Cohu are B2 and B-, respectively. Any future downgrade of Cohu’s credit ratings or rating outlooks may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. Cohu’s current credit ratings are considered non-investment grade and make it more costly (as compared to investment grade borrowers) for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. We are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 26, 2020, the price of our common stock has ranged from $41.00 to $8.89. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test industry, our limited backlog, our debt levels and high leverage, and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. We may underperform relative to our expectations. Our business and financial performance are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as described in these risk factors. We may not achieve our forecasted growth rates, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we expect and may incur losses in the business at any time. Any underperformance from our expectations or forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cause abrupt, significant stock price declines. Also, perceived company underperformance could attract shareholder activism and such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in other short-term focused corporate actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price.        21     Table of Contents Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make a takeover of Cohu more difficult. There are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Delaware law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States. The change in administration in the United States in January 2021 may result in changes to, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs, modifications to international trade policy, increased duties, tariffs or other export restrictions, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation, corporate tax legislation, new employment and privacy laws, and antitrust enforcement. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German subsidiaries income tax returns for 2015 to 2017, and our Philippines subsidiary income tax return for 2017 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in their respective countries. Subsequent to December 26, 2020, we were notified by the taxing authority in Malaysia of its intent to perform an audit for 2014 to 2019 for one of our Malaysian subsidiaries. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Xcerra, a greater than 50% cumulative ownership change in Xcerra triggered a significant limitation in the utilization of their net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. Cohu’s ability to use the acquired Xcerra U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations as defined in sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.        22     Table of Contents In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition.  In fiscal year 2020, 83% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan. There have been significant changes in U.S. export regulations relating to China since 2019. In May 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the BIS’s Entity List, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei (all references to Huawei include its wholly-owned subsidiary HiSilicon). Subsequently, in May 2020 and August 2020, BIS announced rules which amended the foreign-produced direct product rule and the Entity List to target Huawei’s acquisition of Huawei-designed and subsequently third-party semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S.-origin software and technology. Also, as of June 2020, the BIS requires exporters to obtain a license for specified items if at the time of the export they had knowledge that the item was intended to support Chinese “military end users,” in addition to “military end uses.” Cohu has evaluated the foregoing regulations, and at this time, despite an ongoing material adverse impact on direct and indirect Huawei sales, we have not seen any overall material impact to our business. However, we believe that these collective export restrictions and the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations have encouraged China-based companies to actively seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our foreign competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to China-based companies. Recent history indicates that the U.S. government may impose other new export restrictions, or tariffs, without prior notice impacting our ability (or our customers’ ability) to sell and ship products to China-based companies and any such additional restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, the change in administration in the United States in January 2021 may result in changes to, and uncertainty with respect to, trade tariffs and export restrictions. Any such changes may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities, and new laws and regulations (such as involving climate change) or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. In addition, new regulations or public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.        23     Table of Contents Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, the Economy, and Litigation Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We have been impacted by immaterial “phishing” schemes and we are continuing our efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. We believe that extensive employee telework practices, implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased our cybersecurity risks. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Further, in late 2020, a global cyberbreach, widely reported as the “SolarWinds” hack, occurred and caused significant disruption at one of our suppliers and as a result created delays in our operation. Any future attacks that disrupt our IT systems, or those of our suppliers, could impact our sales, financial results and stock price. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. The occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters are located in Singapore and Taiwan, and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. Our business could also be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, and has been and is continuing to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic (see risk factor entitled “The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations”). Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by Asia, the United States, other countries or the European Union might also have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery.        24     Table of Contents We may become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative, regulatory or governmental proceedings, including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. "

9,COHU,COHU INC,2019-03-14,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Xcerra acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.Cohu acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”) on October 1, 2018, whereby Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the “Merger”). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the integration of Xcerra may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customers, suppliers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include: ●difficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;●such a new market for Cohu, the automated test equipment market, is intensely competitive with entrenched large competitors who are much larger than Cohu;●successfully managing relationships with Cohu and Xcerra’s combined supplier and customer base;●coordinating and integrating independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs;●coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company’s capabilities and the direction of product development;●difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;●difficulties and errors that may occur in integrating disparate accounting staffs, processes and systems;●the increased scale and complexity of Cohu’s operations resulting from the Merger;●Cohu’s ability to achieve the targeted cost synergies within the expected time frame, and significant costs of integration and restructuring;●retaining key employees of Cohu and Xcerra;●obligations that Cohu will have to counterparties of Xcerra that arise as a result of the change in control of Xcerra;●legal impediments, delays and significant costs to reduce headcounts in various geographies;●the impact of litigation and potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Xcerra; and●diversion of management’s attention to integration matters. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits. 7Table of Contents We have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger that could adversely affect our results of operations.Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process, and restructuring charges may significantly exceed original estimates. For example, a significant portion of planned cost synergies relate to headcount reductions, primarily in foreign jurisdictions where the labor laws are complex. Any delays in implementing such headcount reductions, or increased costs to implement, would materially impact the cost synergies achieved. These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Cohu incurred $9.8 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018. Xcerra may underperform relative to our expectations.The business and financial performance of Xcerra are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Xcerra have achieved or might achieve separately. Any underperformance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited.As a result of the Merger an ownership change has occurred at Xcerra and as a consequence Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards, that were already partially limited due to a prior acquisition, will be subject to annual limitations as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383. These annual limitations will result in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of these carryforwards. Uncertainties underlie Cohu’s expectation that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share.Cohu believes that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share upon completion of the ongoing restructuring and integration.  However, Cohu cannot give any assurance that the Merger will actually be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share. In addition to the uncertainties that underlie any financial forecast, Cohu will account for the Merger as an acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” or “ASC 805”. The total cost of the Merger will be allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values.  Until these allocations are completed, Cohu can only estimate the allocation of the acquisition price to the net assets acquired and the effect of the allocation on future results. That estimate could materially change. The use of cash and incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the Merger may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.The Merger was financed in part by using Cohu’s and Xcerra’s cash on hand and the incurrence of indebtedness. In connection with the Merger, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the “Debt Financing” or “Credit Agreement”). Cohu used $160.5 million of Cohu’s and Xcerra’s cash on hand to complete the Merger. After completing the Merger and paying acquisition-related costs, Cohu’s (including Xcerra’s) cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 29, 2018 were approximately $165.0 million.  The use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition has reduced Cohu’s liquidity and could cause Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu’s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu’s cash flow for working capital, dividend and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans. Our Credit Agreement contains various negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: ●incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;●issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;●pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;●make loans, investments or acquisitions;●enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;●create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;●sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;●enter into certain transactions with affiliates;●sell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries’ assets; and●dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person. The restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to: ●finance our operations;●make needed capital expenditures;●make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;●withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;●engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and●plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. 8Table of Contents A breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. If a default under any such debt agreement is not cured or waived, the default could result in the acceleration of debt under our debt agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, which could require us to repay debt prior to the date it is otherwise due and that could adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement. Because of high debt levels, Cohu has total consolidated long-term debt of $346 million, and may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.Cohu’s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the Debt Financing agreements will depend on Cohu’s future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of Cohu’s products and pressure from competitors. In addition, Cohu is subject to interest rate risks, and continuing increases in interest rates will increase Cohu’s debt service obligations. Should Cohu’s revenues decline after the Merger, as they are forecasted to do so in first quarter 2019, Cohu may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. If Cohu is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the Merger or should Cohu fail to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, Cohu may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue Cohu Common Stock or other equity securities. Cohu may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to Cohu, in amounts sufficient to meet Cohu’s needs or at all. If Cohu is able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to Cohu’s stockholders. Cohu’s inability to service its debt obligations or refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results after the Merger. In addition, Cohu’s debt obligations may limit its ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and may impact our ability to utilize future deductions. However, the Act permits indefinite carryforward of any disallowed business interest, subject to Internal Revenue Code section 382 limitations on utilization. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger, and any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company.The Merger was financed in part by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to shareholders of Xcerra, comprised approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the Merger. These issuances of additional shares of our common stock have diluted shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders now have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of completion of the Merger. Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets will be represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.Cohu has accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. As a result of the merger, 49.5% of Cohu’s total assets is comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $242.1 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangibles each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. Once adjusted, there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods. 9Table of Contents If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.We are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Completing the Merger has significantly increased the size, number of employees, global operations and complexity of Cohu’s business. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. Cohu may discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance.We may discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs, including potential accounting and tax charges. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are ultimately dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by Xcerra, as well as the limited amount of time in which the acquisition was executed. Cohu cannot provide assurance that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate.Cohu stockholders may not receive the same dividends in the future for various reasons, including the following: ●as a result of the Merger and the issuance of shares of Cohu Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the total amount of cash required for Cohu to pay dividends at its current rate will increase;●Cohu’s credit agreement restricts payments of dividends under certain circumstances;●Cohu may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to Cohu’s cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;●decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the Cohu Board, which reserves the right to change Cohu’s dividend practices at any time;●rising interest rates, which increase Cohu’s debt service obligations;●Cohu may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve its credit ratings; and●difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;●the amount of dividends that Cohu’s subsidiaries may distribute to Cohu may be subject to restrictions imposed by state or foreign law, restrictions that may be imposed by state or foreign regulators, and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur. We have elected to terminate Xcerra’s agreement with Spirox Corporation as a distributor in China and Taiwan. If we are unable to adequately replace Spirox, or if its performance deteriorates during the transition period, it may adversely impact our business.The Xcerra division has relied on Spirox Corporation (“Spirox”) as its primary distribution channel for sales and service in China and Taiwan for its Semiconductor Test Solutions products, a region that represents a material portion of Xcerra’s revenues. Spirox has had direct contact with Xcerra’s customers, and Spirox has been obligated to satisfy all installation and service obligations for the Semiconductor Test Solutions products. After a thorough review of this arrangement, on October 12, 2018, we notified Spirox of our intention to terminate the Spirox distribution agreement, and subsequently negotiated an accelerated wind-down and termination date of March 12, 2019. Our business and financial performance within the China and Taiwan region can be negatively impacted if cooperation with Spirox during the transition fails or if Cohu is delayed and otherwise fails to timely and adequately staff and fund sales and service resources in the region to replace those resources that have previously been provided by Spirox. 10Table of Contents We are exposed to other risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures.As part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to: ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;●increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;●the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;●the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;●lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;●potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;●failure to commercialize purchased technology;●the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and●challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 29, 2018, we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $242.1 million and $319.0 million, respectively. We are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful.Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace.  We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor markets, while also investing in next generation test handlers and automated test equipment.  We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results.  For example, our PANTHER wafer level package probe system has incurred significant development costs, but has not generated material revenues for us.  There can be no assurance that new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including: ●costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;●legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;●trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;●compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations; 11Table of Contents ●complex labor laws and privacy regulations;●difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;●longer payment cycles;●local political and economic conditions;●potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and●fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry.  Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market.  We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns.  Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.  In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements.  In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $1.4 million, $1.1 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. More recently, in the second half of 2018 and continuing into 2019, we have seen weakening demand in mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our third and fourth quarter 2018 results, and are expected to adversely impact our 2019 outlook and results as well. Finally, we have already incurred $19.1 million of inventory charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products, and these charges may be insufficient as market conditions and demand changes. 12Table of Contents Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry.  Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are significantly limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive.The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. We have increased investments in our test contactor business, and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. In addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu has entered the automated test equipment (“ATE”) market. Our ability to increase our ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Further, Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. 13Table of Contents Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2018. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by Asia, the United States, other countries or the European Union might also have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery. 14Table of Contents A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products.  These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors.  A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products.  Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations.  We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce.  The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls.  We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements.  The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. For example, in the second half of 2018 and continuing into 2019, we have seen weakening demand in mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our third and fourth quarter 2018 results, and are expected to adversely impact our 2019 outlook and results as well. 15Table of Contents The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California, Boston, Massachusetts, Rosenheim and Kolbermoor, Germany, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers.The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (“U.S.”) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German subsidiaries income tax returns for 2012 to 2016 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in Germany. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Xcerra, a greater than 50% cumulative ownership change in Xcerra triggered a significant limitation in the utilization of their net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. The Company’s ability to use the acquired Xcerra U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations as defined in sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. 16Table of Contents On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The changes in the Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the Tax Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, moved from a “worldwide” system of taxation that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on foreign earnings until repatriated to a “territorial”/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject foreign earnings to U.S. Tax when earned and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, respectively. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance (SAB 118), we recorded provisional amounts as of December 30, 2017, however, these provisional amounts were subject to change in 2018, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the Tax Act. During 2018 we completed the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act and recorded an increase in our transition tax liability of approximately $5.1 million that was fully offset by the use of net operating loss carryforwards resulting in no net increase in tax expense. We must continue to address new regulations and interpretations of the Tax Act as they are issued. For further information regarding the potential impact of the Tax Act see Note 8, “Income Taxes” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States.The change in administration in the United States has resulted and may continue to result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such additional changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could impact fuel cell market adoption in the U.S. and the alternative energy technologies sector in the U.S., generally. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to international trade policy, such as approvals by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; increased duties, tariffs or other restrictions; public company reporting requirements; environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement. 17Table of Contents Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and restrictions, may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. Recent public policy changes and new trade tariffs and restrictions between the United States and China may, in our view, create an uncertain business environment. In particular, if tariffs or restrictions are imposed on our products or the products of our customers, there could be a negative impact on our operations and financial performance. For example, in June, August and September, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (the “USTR”) published a list of products covering more than 6,000 separate U.S. tariff lines valued at approximately $250 billion in 2018 trade values, imposing an additional duty of 10% or 25% on the listed product lines. The list generally focuses on products from industrial sectors that contribute to or benefit from the “Made in China 2025” industrial policy, which include industries such as aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the announced and other proposed tariffs on products that we import from China, and we may experience a material increase in the cost of our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. As of the date of this filing, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding U.S. – China trade relations. Future actions, retaliation or further escalations by either the U.S. or China that affect trade relations may also impact our business, or that of our suppliers or customers, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take. To the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Our global Enterprise Resource Management (“ERP”) upgrade may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.We are in development stage for the global replacement of our existing ERP solution. The new solution is being developed as an enterprise solution in partnership with a leading provider of ERP tools. Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business. These implementations are extremely complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could result in the loss or corruption of data, delayed order processing and shipments and increased costs. It could also adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. 18Table of Contents Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to: ●     seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;●     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;●     customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;●     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;●     inventory writedowns;●     unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;●     inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and●     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns. Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 29, 2018, the price of our common stock has ranged from $27.83 to $10.01. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. 19Table of Contents "

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements including expectations of market conditions, challenges and plans, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and is subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by that statute. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, including estimates and projections about our business. Statements concerning financial position, business strategy, and plans or objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors
”. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made and do not necessarily reflect management’s outlook at any other point in time. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or for any other reason. However, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports or documents we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) after the date of this Annual Report. PART I Item 1. Business.  Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our” and “us”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc. On January 4, 2017, we acquired Kita Manufacturing Co. LTD. (“Kita”), a Japan-based manufacturer of spring probe contacts used in final test contactors, probe cards, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) test and connectors sold to customers worldwide. The results of Kita’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. In 2015, we sold our mobile microwave communications equipment business, Broadcast Microwave Services, Inc. (“BMS”). Our decision to sell BMS resulted from the determination that this business was no longer a strategic fit within our organization. The operating results of BMS are being presented as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. Subsequent to the sale of BMS, we have one reportable segment, semiconductor equipment. Financial information on our reportable segment for each of the last three years is included in Note 7, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors and thermal sub-systems used by global semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors. We develop, manufacture, sell and service a broad line of equipment capable of handling a wide range of integrated circuits and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Handlers are electromechanical systems used to automate testing and inspection of integrated circuits and LEDs in the back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process to determine the quality and performance of the semiconductor devices, such as microprocessors, logic, analog, memory or mixed signal devices. The majority of handlers use either pick-and-place, gravity-feed, turret or test-in-strip technologies. The type of device, test parallelism, thermal requirements and signal interface requirements normally determines the appropriate handling approach.  MEMS test modules are independent physical stimuli units for testing sensor integrated circuits typically used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. These MEMS test modules can be integrated to our gravity-feed, pick-and-place, turret or test-in-strip handlers for testing a variety of sensors, including pressure, acoustic, magnetic field hall effect, optical and others. To ensure quality, semiconductors are typically tested at hot and/or cold temperatures, which can simulate the final operating environment. Our test handler products are designed to provide a precisely controlled test environment, often over the range of -60 degrees Celsius to +175 degrees Celsius. As the speed and power of certain integrated circuits, such as microprocessors and mobile processors, have increased so has the need to actively manage the self-generated heat during the test process to maximize yield. This heat is capable of damaging or destroying the integrated circuit and can result in speed downgrading, when devices self-heat and fail to successfully test at their maximum possible speed. Device yields are extremely important and speed grading directly affects the selling price of the integrated circuit and the profitability of the semiconductor manufacturer. In addition to temperature capability, other key factors in the design of test handlers are handling speed, flexibility, parallel test capability, alignment to the test contactors, system size, reliability and cost. 1  Thermal sub-systems are used in advanced burn-in and system-level test applications to maintain and control the temperature of integrated circuits during the testing process. Burn-in stresses devices for detection of early failures (infant mortality) prior to distribution. The burn-in process is also used by semiconductor manufacturers to develop reliability models of newly introduced devices. The objective of reliability testing is to determine a device’s fault-free operation and estimated useful life by exposing the device to various electrical and thermal conditions that impact its performance. System-level testing is required for functional testing of high-end microprocessors as well as mobile processors combined with memory. This is typically the last test operation of complex, expensive integrated circuits prior to the final electronic integration process.  Our products are used in high-volume production environments and many are in service twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week. Customers continuously strive to increase the utilization of their production test equipment and expect high reliability from test handlers, MEMS test modules and thermal subsystems used in burn-in and system-level test. The availability of trained technical support personnel is an important competitive factor in the marketplace. Accordingly, we deploy service engineers worldwide, often within customers’ production facilities, who work with customer personnel to maintain, repair and continuously improve the performance of our equipment. Our Products We offer products for the pick-and-place, gravity-feed, test-in-strip and turret handling, MEMS, burn-in and system-level test markets. We currently sell the following products: The Delta MATRiX is a high-performance pick-and-place handler capable of thermally conditioning devices from -60 degrees Celsius to +175 degrees Celsius. This system is mainly used for testing of semiconductors used in automotive and industrial markets. The Delta Pyramid is a high performance thermal handler for microprocessors, graphics processors and other high power integrated circuits. The Pyramid incorporates our proprietary T-Core thermal control technology that optimizes test yield of power dissipative integrated circuits.  Delta Eclipse is a pick-and-place handler tailored for testing advanced computing and mobile processors that require Cohu’s T-Core active thermal control technology. This product can also be configured without active thermal control for testing of standard analog and digital semiconductors Delta LinX is our platform serving assembly automation. Back-end semiconductor assembly is the major process step prior to device testing and validation. The LinX product line offers advanced JEDEC handling automation that efficiently links various assembly test processes.  The Rasco SO1000 is a high throughput gravity-feed platform that provides an economical solution for testing up to 4 devices in parallel. This handler can be configured for tube-to-tube or metal magazine input and output, ambient-hot or tri-temperature testing and is easily kit-able for a wide range of integrated circuit packages. The Rasco SO1000 and SO2000 are high throughput gravity-feed platforms that provide economical solutions for testing up to 8 devices in parallel.  These handlers can be configured for tube-to-tube or metal magazine input and output, bowl feeding, tape-and-reel. Additionally, these handlers can be configured for ambient-hot or tri-temperature testing. Rasco Saturn and Jupiter are gravity handlers that deliver fast index time capability with up to 8 devices tested in parallel at cold and/or hot temperature. Saturn has a configuration that covers testing of very small to medium size packaged integrated circuits, and Jupiter is a version that enables testing of medium to very large packaged integrated circuits typically serving the power management device market. The Rasco Jaguar test-in-strip handler can process an entire strip at once or index the strip for single/multiple device testing.  The system has tri-temperature capability, accommodates either stacked or slotted input/output media and is configured with automated vision alignment. The Jaguar is also a solution for in-process testing of next generation multi-stacked packages.  The Ismeca NY32 is a scalable, 32-position turret handler used for testing and inspection of integrated circuits, LEDs, and discrete devices. There are many configurations of the NY32 turret handler: handling wafers in film-frame for input and/or output that is common for LEDs and wafer level package (WLP) devices; tray and tube input and/or output used for integrated circuits and discrete devices; and bowl feeding, tape and de-taping, alignment, laser marking, inspection and test modules. The NY32 is capable of testing devices at ambient and hot temperature. 2  The Ismeca NY20 is a turret handler platform that delivers high throughput combined with fast device change-over time for both high-volume and high-mix testing and inspection of integrated circuits, LEDs and discrete devices. The 20-position turret offers many of the functional modules and capabilities available on the NY32 platform in a smaller footprint, higher throughput handler.  MEMS test modules generate physical stimuli for testing of sensor integrated circuits. These are typically used in the automotive (e.g. tire pressure, airbag sensors) and consumer electronics (e.g. tilt, motion, microphone and light sensors) industries. The MEMS modules are stand-alone units that can be integrated into our pick-and-place, turret, test-in-strip, or gravity-feed handlers. Thermal Sub-Systems are used by integrated circuit manufacturers in high performance burn-in and system level test. The Delta T-Core thermal sub-systems provide fast and accurate temperature control of the integrated circuit during the testing process using the same technology available in the Pyramid handler.    Delta Fusion HD is a tri-temperature thermal sub-system that utilizes T-Core technology for testing mobile processors.  PANTHER is a prober that optimizes test and vision inspection of wafer level package (WLP) and bumped dies, delivering a substantial improvement in semiconductor manufacturing quality that is required for today’s high-end consumer products.  Solstice is a system-level test automation platform for complex, integrated semiconductors that typically combine a processor and memory. This product enables greater semiconductor manufacturing quality by testing devices under the actual end-usage conditions.  We design, manufacture, sell and support various lines of Test Contactor solutions. These are consumable, electro-mechanical assemblies that connect the device under test, inside our test handlers, and the automated test equipment. Cohu contactors are used in testing digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, such as the ones produced by Kita, also power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on high performance contacts designed to operate at frequencies up to 34 GHz. We provide consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customer’s equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Our Philippines operation designs and manufactures the majority of our handler kits and provides applications support to customers in the southeast Asia region. Sales by Product Line  During the last three years, our consolidated sales were distributed as follows:   2017  2016  2015 Semiconductor test systems  56%   57%   54% Spares, contactors, tooling (kits) and service  44%   43%   46%  Customers Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, the following customers comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales:    2017  2016  2015 Intel   11.2%  17.2%  18.0%NXP Semiconductors N.V. (1)   15.9%  13.7%  11.4%  (1)The merger of NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Freescale Semiconductor, Ltd. was completed on December 7, 2015. Sales to these customers have been combined for all periods presented.  The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and as a result, we believe that our customer concentration is a significant business risk. 3  Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 7, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Sales and Marketing We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our U.S. sales office is located in Poway, California. The Europe sales offices are located in Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, Korea, and Japan. Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we are a leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition. The Japanese and Korean markets for test handling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. During each of the last three years our sales to Japanese and Korean customers, who have historically purchased test handling equipment from Asian suppliers, have represented less than 10% of our total sales. Some of our current and potential competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and offer more extensive product offerings than Cohu. To remain competitive we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain customer support and service centers worldwide and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world. Backlog Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, was $107.6 million at December 30, 2017, and $65.1 million at December 31, 2016. Backlog at December 30, 2017, will be impacted by our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), on December 31, 2017, the first day of our fiscal 2018. This new accounting guidance amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. For additional information see recently issued accounting pronouncements in Note 1 “Accounting Policies” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Backlog is generally expected to be shipped within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers, failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Manufacturing and Raw Materials Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contractors), Osaka, Japan (test contactors); Poway, California; and Kolbermoor, Germany. Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers.    Patents and Trademarks Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor equipment industry, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Research and Development Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $40.7 million in 2017, $34.8 million in 2016 and $33.1 million in 2015.  We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales of existing products. Environmental Laws Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws. On occasion, we have been notified by local authorities of instances of noncompliance with local and/or state environmental laws. We believe we are in compliance with applicable federal, state, local and international regulations. Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and the prevention of climate change have not had a material effect and are not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or our competitive position. However, future changes in regulations may require expenditures that could adversely impact earnings in future years. Executive Officers of the Registrant The following sets forth the names, ages, positions and offices held by all executive officers of Cohu as of February 16, 2018.

Prior to Ismeca, Mr. Fellenberg spent six years at Orell Füssli Security Printing where he held several executive positions in the document security technology business. He has also held various positions in sales and product management for companies in the automation components (sensors, drives) industry. Employees At December 30, 2017 we had approximately 1,800 employees. Our employee headcount has fluctuated in the last five years primarily due to the volatile and unpredictable business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry. Our headcount has also been impacted by the acquisition of  Kita and the divestiture of BMS. Our employees in the United States and most locations in Asia are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, however, certain employees in Kolbermoor, Germany, are represented by a works council, employees in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland are members of the micro-technology and Swiss watch trade union and, certain employees in our China operation belong to local trade unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that a great part of our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for the services of certain personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. Available Information Our web site address is www.cohu.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our web site, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other documents related to our corporate governance is also posted on our web site at www.cohu.com/investors/corporategovernance. Information contained on our web site is not deemed part of this report. 6  Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures.As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future, such as our acquisition of Kita, which was completed on January 4, 2017. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to: ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;●increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;●the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;●lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;●potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;●failure to commercialize purchased technology;●the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and●challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 30, 2017, we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $65.6 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  We are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful.Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor and wafer level package (WLP) probe and inspection markets, which includes a significant ongoing investment in our PANTHER platform. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results and there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. 7  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including: ●costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;●legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;●trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;●compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;●difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;●longer payment cycles;●local political and economic conditions;●potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and●fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $2.4 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. 8  Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. We could also be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. In addition, with the acquisition of Kita in 2017, we increased our investments in our test contactor business, and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and also high customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  9  The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. 10  If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.  The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.  The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California, Kolbermoor, Germany, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. 11  Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers.The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (“U.S.”) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The changes in the Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the Tax Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, and moved from a “worldwide” system of taxation that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on foreign earnings until repatriated to a “territorial”/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject foreign earnings to U.S. Tax when earned. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance, we recorded a provisional net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 however, this provisional tax benefit is subject to change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, changes in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretations, the issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the Tax Act. For further information regarding the potential impact of the Tax Act, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 12  In addition, in October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its reports on the 15 focus areas identified in its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”). Some BEPS measures will require treaty based or legislative action by countries.  The final impact of BEPS on Cohu’s income tax provision and liability is currently not quantifiable and is likely to result in additional recordkeeping and administrative cost to implement certain of its requirements.  Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States.The change in administration in the United States has resulted and may continue to result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such additional changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could impact fuel cell market adoption in the U.S. and the alternative energy technologies sector in the U.S., generally. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to international trade policy, such as approvals by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; public company reporting requirements; environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Our implementation of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.We recently implemented a new ERP system within our Switzerland and Malaysia operations, to conform these operations to the same ERP system used within our other principal business locations. We intend to continue to make investments and upgrades to our global ERP systems to support our business requirements. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the ERP system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. 13   Our financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts’ estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to: ●     seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;●     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;●     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;●     inventory writedowns;●     unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;●     inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and●     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns. Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 30, 2017, the price of our common stock has ranged from $26.17 to $9.14. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance. "
13,COHU,COHU INC,2017-03-02,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies such as our acquisition of Kita, which was completed on January 4, 2017. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:   ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;  ●increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;  ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;  ●the potential loss of key employees or customers of Cohu or acquired businesses; ●lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;  ●failure to commercialize purchased technology; and  ●the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods.  We may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.   Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $58.8 million and $17.8 million, respectively. These amounts exclude the impact of our acquisition of Kita, which was completed subsequent to our fiscal year end. We expect our goodwill and purchased intangible asset balances will increase as a result of this transaction.  7  We are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful.Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor and wafer level package (WLP) probing markets. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results and there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:   ●costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; ●legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products; ●trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses; ●compliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations; ●difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; ●longer payment cycles; ●local political and economic conditions; ●potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation”; and ●fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We are in the process of transitioning our manufacturing to Asia. Our inability to manage multiple manufacturing sites during this transition and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.  Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and the global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition.  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner.  8  The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $1.1 million, $2.4 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated.  We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. We could also be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.  The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, is highly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.   9  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.  Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery.  10  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.  The seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products.  These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors.  A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products.  Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations.  We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce.  The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls.  We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements.  The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.   The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California, Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland areas, where the majority of our development personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.   11  Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers.The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (“U.S.”) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. In addition, in October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its reports on the 15 focus areas identified in its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”). Some BEPS measures will require treaty based or legislative action by countries.  The final impact of BEPS on Cohu’s income tax provision and liability is currently not quantifiable and is likely to result in additional recordkeeping and administrative cost to implement certain of its requirements. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.  12   In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.  The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer.  Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts’ estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  ●seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;●timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers; ●inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements; ●inventory writedowns;●inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and●intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns. Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.   13  We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 the price of our common stock has ranged from $14.43 to $9.14. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.  "
6,COHU,COHU INC,2016-02-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  We are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful.Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor and wafer level package (WLP) probing markets. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results and there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:   ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;  ●increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;  ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;  ●the potential loss of key employees or customers of Cohu or acquired businesses; ●lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;  ●failure to commercialize purchased technology; and  ●the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods.  We may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.   Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At December 26, 2015 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $60.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively.   7  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:   ●costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; ●unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; ●difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; ●longer payment cycles; ●local political and economic conditions; ●potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation”; and ●fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. We are in the process of transitioning our manufacturing to Asia. Our inability to manage multiple manufacturing sites during this transition and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.  Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and the global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition.  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $2.4 million, $2.6 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts.  8  Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated.  We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. We could also be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.  The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, is highly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2015. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.   9  The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.  Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.  10  If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.  The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products. A number of factors including the semiconductor industry’s continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in integrated circuit design and packaging, result in changes in product demand. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce, particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes in workforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees. Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities and adversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.  The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California, Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland areas, where the majority of our development personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  11  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers.The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (“U.S.”) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu’s ownership. Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.  12  Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.  The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in the Philippines, Malaysia and China. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer.  Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts’ estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  ●     cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;●     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers; ●     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements; ●     inventory writedowns;●     inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and●     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns. Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.  We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from $13.84 to $8.63. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.  "
0,COHU,COHU INC,2015-02-24,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with theSEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our commonstock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurswith material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of yourinvestment.  We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures. We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/ortechnologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:      difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;     diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;     the potential loss of key employees or customers of Cohu or acquired businesses;     lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;     failure to commercialize purchased technology; and      the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods. We may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equityor debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. With respect to divestitures, we may divest businesses thatdo not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets and may not be able to complete proposed divestitures on terms commercially favorable to us.  Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. At December 27, 2014 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $63.1 million and $33.1 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2014 we determined that the carrying value of our microwave  8 Table of Contentscommunications equipment segment was higher than its current fair market value and, as a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $5.0 million. Additional information canbe found in Note 3, Microwave Communications Equipment Segment Impairment and Restructuring in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K. Subsequent to this write-off we still have goodwill within our semiconductor equipment reportingunit and we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future, which will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.  We are a globalcorporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspectsinherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:      costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;     longer payment cycles;      local political and economic conditions;      potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation; and     fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure,communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business andresults of operations will be adversely affected.  We are in the process of transitioning our manufacturing to Asia. Our inability tomanage multiple manufacturing sites during this transition and secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks,which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or if one ormore of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseasmanufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in atimely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.  Our suppliersare subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and the global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resultingin demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doingbusiness with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition.  Our microwave communications equipment segment depends on governments for a significant portion of its sales, creating uncertainty in the timing of and funding for projected contracts. A significant portion of the sales of BMS are made to federal, state, local and foreign government agencies as a prime orsub-contractor. Government spending has historically been cyclical. A decrease in government spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. Reductions or delays in thefunding process or changes in funding caused by automatic budget cuts (sequestration) or unforeseen world events can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination. The loss of anticipatedfunding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future sales and earnings.   9 Table of ContentsThe semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable. Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on our semiconductor equipment business. This capital equipmentbusiness is in turn highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had asignificant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment mayalso be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financialposition and results of operations. In addition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventorywrite-offs and reserve requirements. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $3.9 million, $7.8 million, and $8.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customerforecasts.  Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available onfavorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  Our business requires capital to finance accountsreceivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner thananticipated.  We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities willprovide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and mayincur expenses in raising the additional funds and future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. We could also be limited by financialand other restrictive covenants in credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equitysecurities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressuresor unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.  The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, is highly competitive.  The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small interms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supplytest handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there areemerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance oftheir current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes overrights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler markethave intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfullyintroduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerousrisks and uncertainties.  Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our futuresuccess will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved   10 Table of Contentsperformance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including theproducts obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of largecustomers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsoleteinventory exposure. This increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2014. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements couldhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  The design, development, commercial introduction andmanufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of theequipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industrys constantlyevolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and finalmanufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the marketpotential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes.Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrys future equipment requirements andfail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on ouroperations, financial condition and results of operations.  The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductorequipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our newequipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and productdevelopments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customerrequirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.  Globaleconomic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.  Ouroperations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future.Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experienceincreased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.  In addition, thetightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell.Delays in our customers ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing,duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery.  A limited number ofcustomers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.  A small number of customers of our semiconductor equipment segmenthave been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers businessand their purchase of   11 Table of Contentsproducts from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that ourcompetitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenuesderived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand forour customers products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.  If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costlyand uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting ourbusiness, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In orderto address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may resultin additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverseeffect on our operating results.

We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for themanufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number ofsuppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities ofvarious parts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of ourproprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit,could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inabilityto license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.  The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability,particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages overUnited States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price ofsemiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, theamounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assessadditional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated,unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our businessoperations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. Inparticular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S and other countries. Furthermore, thesecarryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohus ownership.  Compliance with regulations mayimpact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.  Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and otherforeign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and couldexpose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and U.S. and other foreign country laws suchas the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal  13 Table of Contentssanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed toensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could includeprohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business andour operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us toincur significant expenses.  In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding ourproducts. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials comefrom, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost ofmaterials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.  Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or otherespionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might beunaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in researchand development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers or licensees confidential information, we may incurliability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operationsand sales.  Our Corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located inSingapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in the Philippines, Malaysia and China. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such asearthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind,and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer. Furthermore, we have customers throughout the Middle East and terrorist attacks, protests orother threats in this region may cause geopolitical instability, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:     cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;     inventory writedowns;      inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time ourquarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.  14 Table of ContentsWe have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares ofhigh-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $14.16 to $7.96. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration,intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuationsrelated and unrelated to our performance"
3,COHU,COHU INC,2014-03-05,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from theresults expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionarystatements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known tous or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, our business, financial condition and results of operations could beseriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures. We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/ortechnologies such as our acquisition of Ismeca, which was completed on December 31, 2012. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:     difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;     diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;     the potential loss of key employees or customers of Cohu or acquired businesses;     lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;     failure to commercialize purchased technology; and      the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods. We may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equityor debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. With respect to divestitures, we may divest businesses thatdo not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets and may not be able to complete proposed divestitures on terms commercially favorable to us.  Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. At December 28, 2013 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $71.3 million and $45.3 million, respectively.  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.  We are a globalcorporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspectsinherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:      costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;     longer payment cycles;      local political and economic conditions;      potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation; and     fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure,communications and information technology, inventory control,   9 Table of Contentscustomer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and resultsof operations will be adversely affected.  The implementation of our Enterprise Resource Planning software could disrupt our businesswhich could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.  We are in the process of finalizing the implementation of an EnterpriseResource Planning (ERP) software system which may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations. Our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity. The ERPsystem implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems. These costs and risks could include, but are not limited to:     significant operating expenditures;      disruptions to our domestic and international supply chains;     inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis, or at all;     inability to process payments to suppliers, vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner;     disruptions to or the ineffectiveness of our internal control environment;     inability to fulfill our SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner;     inability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner; and     increased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives. The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable.  Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on our semiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent on theoverall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductorindustrys demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Inaddition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2013,2012 and 2011, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $8.1 million, $8.9 million, and $5.8 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, is highly competitive. The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. Thetest handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition mayinclude companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensiveproduct offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continueto improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products withperceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitiveconditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reducethe cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.   10 Table of ContentsSemiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions andtransitions may result in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability toenhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products,including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number oflarge customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess andobsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2013. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserverequirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  The design, development, commercialintroduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements,integration of the equipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductorindustrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuitassembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors,assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the samemanufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrys futureequipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a materialadverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.  The transition from product development to the manufacture ofnew semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume productionof our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes andproduct developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfycustomer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which have deterioratedsignificantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experiencedstrong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raisecapital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect ourproduct sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery. A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers of our semiconductor equipment segment have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past fiveyears, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant   11 Table of Contentscustomers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor testhandler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain ourcompetitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by theseor other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or otherfactors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in ourfuture annual and quarterly operating results.  We do not currently participate in the memory test handler market. Pick-and-place handlers used in memory test applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market. We do not currentlyparticipate in the mainstream memory market segment; therefore our total available sales market is limited.  If we cannot continue todevelop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.  The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with ourproducts and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers andsuppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs,adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products. Changesin product demand result from a number of factors including the semiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand forsemiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce, particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes in workforce levels place enormous demandson our employees, operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees. Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and businesslevels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems,facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. We utilize contract manufacturers and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could causeus to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.  Our reliance on contract manufacturers gives us less control over themanufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks, including limited control over capacity, late delivery, quality and costs. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturerrelationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional contractmanufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers may increase the complexity of our supply  12 Table of Contentschain management. We cannot be certain that existing or future contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or to our quality andperformance specifications. If our contract manufacturers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.  Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment ornon-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition forqualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California, Kolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-deFonds, Switzerland areas, where the majority of our development personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisiteskills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected bythe loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiplequalified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain componentsthat are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results ofoperations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner.  Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.  We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, orbe challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costlylitigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitutesimilar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  A majorityof our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian test handling equipment suppliers. The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact thedemand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantagesinclude, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capitalequipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers.  The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instabilitycaused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.  Our Asian sales and service headquartersis located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in the Philippines, Malaysia and China. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and otherrisks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptionsof this kind, and   13 Table of Contentsdo not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer. Furthermore, we have customers throughout theMiddle East and terrorist attacks, protests or other threats in this region may cause geopolitical instability, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, theamounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assessadditional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated,unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our businessoperations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. Inparticular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S and other countries. Furthermore, thesecarryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohus ownership.  Compliance with regulations mayimpact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.  Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United Statesand other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictionsand could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and U.S. and other foreign country laws suchas the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents willnot violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could alsomaterially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations,even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.  In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has recently adopteddisclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo oradjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify thatour products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.  Our microwave communication equipment and video camera segments depend on government spending for a significant portion of their sales, creating uncertainty in the timing of and funding forprojected contracts.  A significant portion of the sales of BMS, Inc. and Cohu Electronics are made to federal, state, localand foreign government agencies as a prime or sub-contractor. Government spending has historically been cyclical. A decrease in government spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the programs being reduced, delayedor terminated. Reductions or delays in the funding process or changes in funding caused by automatic budget cuts (sequestration) or unforeseen world events can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in programcontent or termination. The loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future sales and earnings.   14 Table of ContentsOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. Theseattempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and toprevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitiveposition, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers orlicensees confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:     cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;     inventory writedowns;      inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time ourquarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.  A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours,have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from $7.96 to $17.18. The price of our stock may bemore volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limitedbacklog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance"

. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that couldcause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures. We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/ortechnologies such as our acquisition of Ismeca, which was completed on December 31, 2012. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:     difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;     diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;     the potential loss of key employees or customers of Cohu or acquired businesses;     lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;     failure to commercialize purchased technology; and      the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods. We may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equityor debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. With respect to divestitures, we may divest businesses thatdo not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets and may not be able to complete proposed divestitures on terms commercially favorable to us.  Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. At December 29, 2012 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $58.8 million and $19.0 million, respectively. These amounts exclude the impact of our acquisition of Ismeca, which was completedsubsequent to our fiscal year end. We expect our goodwill and purchased intangible asset balances will increase significantly as a result of this transaction.  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.  We are a globalcorporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspectsinherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:      costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;     longer payment cycles;      local political and economic conditions;      potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation; and     fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs.   9 Table of ContentsAdditionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated withorganizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managingsuch operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.  The semiconductor industry we serve ishighly volatile and unpredictable.  Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on oursemiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods ofoversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractorswill materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significantexcess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $8.9 million, $5.8 million, and $1.7 million,respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts.  The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the testhandler market in particular, is highly competitive.  The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we facesubstantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participantsresulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering,manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that maycompete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new productsin a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced salesof, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling pricesand gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating resultsin the foreseeable future.  Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions mayresult in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.  Semiconductor equipment andprocesses are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to investheavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition,the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increasesthe risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in thethree-year period ended December 29, 2012. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number ofrisks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other   10 Table of Contentssuppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy thesemiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integratedcircuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and otherfactors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ thesame manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrysfuture equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have amaterial adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.  The transition from product development to themanufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing andvolume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Futuretechnologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in atimely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.  Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.  Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and mayremain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current marketconditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.  In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance theirpurchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm ourbusiness and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery.  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers of our semiconductor equipment segment have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past fiveyears, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductortest handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintainour competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders bythese or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or otherfactors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in ourfuture annual and quarterly operating results.   11 Table of ContentsWe do not currently participate in the memory test handler market. Pick-and-place handlers used in memory test applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market. We do not currentlyparticipate in the memory market segment; therefore our total available sales market is limited.  If we cannot continue to develop,manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.  The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with ourproducts and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers andsuppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs,adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products. Changesin product demand result from a number of factors including the semiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand forsemiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce, particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes in workforce levels place enormous demandson our employees, operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees. Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and businesslevels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems,facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. We utilize contract manufacturers and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could causeus to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.  Our reliance on contract manufacturers gives us less control over themanufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks, including limited control over capacity, late delivery, quality and costs. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturerrelationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional contractmanufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers may increase the complexity of our supply chain management. Wecannot be certain that existing or future contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or to our quality and performance specifications. If our contract manufacturers are unable to meet ourmanufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.  The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.  Certain keypersonnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results alsodepend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, isintense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California,   12 Table of ContentsKolbermoor, Germany and La Chaux-de Fonds, Switzerland areas, where the majority of our development personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employeesfrom other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business,financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retainskilled employees.  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner couldadversely impact our operations.  We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Inaddition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various partsand components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of ourproprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit,could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inabilityto license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.  The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability,particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over U.S.suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers.  The occurrence of naturaldisasters in Asia and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.  Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have manufacturing plants in the Philippines, Malaysia andChina. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake or tsunami could materiallyaffect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business wouldsuffer. Furthermore, we have customers throughout the Middle East and terrorist attacks, protests or other threats in this region may cause geopolitical instability, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.  Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United States and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance withcomplex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These lawsand regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibitingcorrupt   13 Table of Contentspayments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct ofour business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or thatour policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, ourbrand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could betime-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.  Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or otherespionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might beunaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in researchand development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers or licensees confidential information, we may incurliability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:     cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;     inventory writedowns;      inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time ourquarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.  A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours,have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from $7.96 to $17.35. The price of our stock may bemore volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limitedbacklog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance"

Historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductorindustrys demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Inaddition, the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2011,2010 and 2009, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $5.8 million, $1.7 million, and $4.4 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, is highly competitive. The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. Thetest handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures.Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive productofferings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue toimprove the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceivedor actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions inthe semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of ourexisting products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions may result in inventory write-offs and ournew product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.  Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapidtechnological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research anddevelopment and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of newproducts by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that ourestablished products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year periodended December 31, 2011. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.   9 Table of ContentsThe design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is aninherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers equipment andthe customers manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance atprices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package designchanges. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling and burn-in testequipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test productsthat are capable of achieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrys future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve marketacceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions andproblems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our aftersale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and wemight not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realizeacceptable profit margins on such products.  Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition inways that we currently cannot predict.  Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impacton levels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believewe have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverseeffect on our cash flow.  In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it moredifficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of suchfinancing, would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing or strength of asubsequent recovery.  A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales. A small number of customers of our semiconductor equipment segment have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past fiveyears, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductortest handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintainour competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders bythese or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.  10 Table of ContentsWe do not participate in the DRAM test handler market. Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market. We do not participate in theDRAM market segment; therefore our total available sales market is limited.  If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and marketproducts and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.  The processof developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accuratelycould significantly harm our market share and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering,design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causeof quality problems and to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues canimpair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.  The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.  The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations.Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce, particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes in workforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newly hiredpersonnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees. Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities and adversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in thefuture experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductorindustry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customerschanging requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.  We utilize contract manufacturers and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customerrelationships.  Our reliance on contract manufacturers gives us less control over the manufacturing process and exposes us tosignificant risks, including limited control over capacity, late delivery, quality and costs. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should fail toeffectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites,our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers may increase the complexity of our supply chain management. We cannot be certain that existing or future contractmanufacturers will be able to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or to our quality and performance specifications. If our contract manufacturers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, ourability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.   11 Table of ContentsThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel,many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, salesand support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego,California area, where the majority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevantindustry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of ourkey employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.  We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.  We are a globalcorporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspectsinherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:      costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;     longer payment cycles;      local political and economic conditions;      potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation; and     fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs. Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure,communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business andresults of operations will be adversely affected.  Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timelyand cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.  We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassembliesfor the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limitednumber of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliablequantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, investments and divestitures. We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/ortechnologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:      difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;     diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;     the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;     lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;     failure to commercialize purchased technology; and      the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods.  12 Table of ContentsWe may be required to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings,proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.  With respect to divestitures, we maydivest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets and may not be able to complete proposed divestitures on terms commercially favorable to us. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2011 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $58.1 million and $21.8 million, respectively. Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of ourproprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit,could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inabilityto license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.  The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability,particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over U.S.suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers.  The occurrence of naturaldisasters in Asia and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.  Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have a location in the Philippines which fabricates certaincomponent parts used in our products. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake ortsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of suchdisaster, our business would suffer. Furthermore, we have customers throughout the Middle East and terrorist attacks, protests or other threats in this region may cause geopolitical instability which may have an adverse impact on our business,results of operations and financial condition.  Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers. Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United States export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. laws andregulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and exportrequirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these lawsand regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensurecompliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could includeprohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business andour operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us toincur significant expenses.   13 Table of ContentsOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. Theseattempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and toprevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitiveposition, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' orlicensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.  Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:     timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;     inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;     inventory writedowns;      inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and     intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.  Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to time ourquarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.  A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours,have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from $7.00 to $17.35. The price of our stock may bemore volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limitedbacklog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated toour performance"
10,COHU,COHU INC,2011-02-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with theSEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from theresults expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, andthe other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The tradingprice of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part ofyour investment.The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable.Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on oursemiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent onthe overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry hasbeen highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have hada significant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, includingequipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductormanufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile andunpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future exposeus to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges ofapproximately $1.7 million, $4.4 million, and $6.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result ofchanges in customer forecasts.8Table of ContentsThe semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, ishighly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantialcompetition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, whilerelatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductorequipment industry, has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intensecompetitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currentlysupply test handlers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering,manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. Inaddition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provideinnovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products.We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their currentproducts and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure tointroduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products withperceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property ortechnology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins onour existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handlermarket have intensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adverselyimpacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we areunable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower costproducts we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operatingresults in the foreseeable future.Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions andtransitions may result in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerousrisks and uncertainties.Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe thatour future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop newproducts with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily inresearch and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of newproducts, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/ormargins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by ourcompetitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, themigration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory partsincreases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete,resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resultedin significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period endedDecember 25, 2010. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements couldhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment isan inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risksinclude potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integrationof the equipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes,transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment tosatisfy the semiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance atprices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductorequipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and finalmanufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate ofchange in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of thesechanges and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling andburn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition,not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences insuch processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achievingbroad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrysfuture equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirementsand achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and markettrends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations,financial condition and results of operations.9Table of ContentsThe transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is adifficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipmentare common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing andvolume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment,our after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with newproducts than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and productdevelopments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be ableto develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to ourexisting products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance.Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways thatwe currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact onlevels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regionsand may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce futuresales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and haveexperienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we mayexperience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a materialadverse effect on our cash flow.In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit maymake it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance theirpurchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers abilityto obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, would adversely affect ourproduct sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannotpredict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing orstrength of a subsequent recovery.A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.A small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our netsales. In the year ended December 25, 2010, two customers of the semiconductor equipment segmenteach represented more than 10% of our consolidated net sales and, combined, they accounted for 40%(41% in 2009, and 45% in 2008) of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of oursales derived from each of these and other significant customers has varied greatly. Suchvariations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase of products from ourcompetitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchaseequipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive positionwith a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue tomaintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, weexpect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly infuture periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significantcustomers as a result of competitive products, market conditions, outsourcing final semiconductortest to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a materialadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, theconcentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significantfluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.We do not participate in the DRAM test handler market.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market. We do not participate in the DRAM market segment; therefore ourtotal available sales market is limited.If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customerrequirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing productsand services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our marketshare and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we mustadequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects inour engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party componentsincluded in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with ourcustomers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problemsand to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive andmay result in additionalwarranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, qualityissues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect ourreputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.10Table of ContentsThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products.

Compliance with complex U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationalsales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and couldexpose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import andexport requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) andU.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibiting corruptpayments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result infines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct ofour business and damage to our reputation.

Any such violations could include prohibitions on our abilityto offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage ourreputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retainemployees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violationsof these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costlylitigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.11Table of ContentsWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to supportour sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doingbusiness abroad that we do not face domestically.

Furthermore, we have customers throughout theMiddle East and terrorist attacks or other threats in this region may cause geopoliticalinstability which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   inventory writedowns;   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and   intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause themarket price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.13Table of ContentsWe have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $7.00 to $20.52. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of othercompanies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductorindustry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry,our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stocktrading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuatesignificantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance"
18,COHU,COHU INC,2010-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.Set forth below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with theSEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from theresults expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, andthe other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The tradingprice of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part ofyour investment.Thesemiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile andunpredictable.Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on oursemiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent onthe overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry hasbeen highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have hada significant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, includingequipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductormanufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile andunpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future exposeus to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges ofapproximately $4.4 million, $6.2 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result ofchanges in customer forecasts.The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, ishighly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantialcompetition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, whilerelatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductorequipment industry, has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intensecompetitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currentlysupply test handlers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering,manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. Inaddition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provideinnovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products.We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their currentproducts and introduce newproducts with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timelymanner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, ordisputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss ofour competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believethat competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the lastseveral years. This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling pricesand gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existingproducts and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditionsto negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.9Table of ContentsSemiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions andtransitions may result in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerousrisks and uncertainties.Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe thatour future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop newproducts with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily inresearch and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of newproducts, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/ormargins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by ourcompetitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, themigration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory partsincreases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete,resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increased exposure resultedin significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period endedDecember 26, 2009. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements couldhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment isan inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risksinclude potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integrationof the equipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes,transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment tosatisfy the semiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance atprices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductorequipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and finalmanufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate ofchange in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of thesechanges and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling andburn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition,not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences insuch processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achievingbroad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrysfuture equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirementsand achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and markettrends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations,financial condition and results of operations.The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is adifficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipmentare common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing andvolume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment,our after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with newproducts than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and productdevelopments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be ableto develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to ourexisting products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance.Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways thatwe currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact onlevels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regionsand may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued uncertainties may reduce futuresales of our products and services. Whilewe believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, ifthe current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greaterwrite-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.10Table of ContentsIn addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit maymake it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance theirpurchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers abilityto obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, would adversely affect ourproduct sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannotpredict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of the economic slowdown or the timing orstrength of a subsequent recovery.Alimited number of customers account for a substantial percentage ofour net sales.A small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our netsales. In the year ended December 26, 2009, two customers of the semiconductor equipment segmentaccounted for 41% (45% in 2008, and 55% in 2007) of our net sales. During the past five years, thepercentage of our sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has variedgreatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase ofproducts from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry forcustomers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that ourcompetitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that wewill continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers.Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will varygreatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or othersignificant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions, outsourcing finalsemiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have amaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely tocause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.Wedo not participate in the DRAM test handler market.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market. We do not participate in the DRAM market segment; therefore ourtotal available sales market is limited.If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customerrequirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross marginmay suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing productsand services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our marketshare and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we mustadequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects inour engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party componentsincluded in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with ourcustomers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problemsand to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive andmay result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits.In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers andadversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changesin integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipmenthave a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce,particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes inworkforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newlyhired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees.Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experiencedifficulties, particularly in manufacturing,in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility inheadcount and business levels, combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, mayrequire that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures andcontrols. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and productioncapacity to meet our customers changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirementswill have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.11Table of ContentsTheloss of key personnel could adversely impact ourbusiness.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results dependsubstantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound byemployment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significantpart upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical,engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel,particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting orretaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California area,where the majority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty inrecruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number ofpersons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions andit may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financialcondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any ofour key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, orby our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.Compliancewith regulations may impact sales to foreign customers.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United States export and otherregulations. Compliance with complex U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationalsales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and couldexpose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import andexport requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) andU.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and local laws prohibiting corruptpayments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result infines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct ofour business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and proceduresdesigned to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees,contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective inpreventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our abilityto offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage ourreputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retainemployees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violationsof these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costlylitigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.Weare exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to supportour sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doingbusiness abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting businessinternationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;  longer payment cycles;  local political and economic conditions;  potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings andthe threat of double taxation; and  fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs.Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associatedwith organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology,inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security mattersand cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, ourbusiness and results of operations will be adversely affected.We utilize contract manufacturers and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, mayresult in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customerrelationships.Our reliance on contract manufacturers gives us less control over the manufacturing process andexposes us to significant risks, including limited control over capacity, late delivery, qualityand costs. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additionalcontract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage ourcontract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptionsor quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers orcontract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also,the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers may increase the complexity ofour supply chain management. We cannot be certain that existing or future contract manufacturerswill be able to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or to our qualityand performance specifications. If our contract manufacturers are unable to meet our manufacturingrequirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenueswhen anticipated could be materially affected.12Table of ContentsFailure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely andcost-effective manner could adversely impact ouroperations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts,components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a singlesupplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certaincomponents that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. Onoccasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of variousparts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially andadversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely andcost effective manner.Weare exposed to risks associated with acquisitions andinvestments.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in,businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions and investmentsinvolve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel,operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;  diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;  the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;  lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from theacquisition;  failure to commercialize purchased technology; and  the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significantcharges to operating results in future periods.Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively managethese risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. At December 26, 2009 we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of$61.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively.Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietaryrights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietaryrights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patentlife, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receivenotices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or withoutmerit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managementsattention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successfulclaim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technologyor to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and resultsof operations could be adversely affected.A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, thatare subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economicinstability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, includingequipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from anumber of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. Theseadvantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliationwith significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price ofsemiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spendingprograms of our foreign and domestic customers.Theoccurrence of natural disasters in Asia may adversely impact ouroperations and sales.Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales aremade to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have an operation in the Philippines that fabricatescertain component parts used in our products. These regions are known for being vulnerable tonatural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and fires, which at timeshave disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake, tsunami or other geological eventcould materially affect our operating results. We are not insured for most losses and businessinterruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in theevent of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer.13Table of ContentsOur financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;  inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;  inventory writedowns;  inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and  intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause themarket price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.Wehave experienced significant volatility in our stockprice.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $7.00 to $23.70. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of othercompanies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductorindustry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry,our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stocktrading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuatesignificantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance"

If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. The tradingprice of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part ofyour investment.Current global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition inways that we currently cannot predict.Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact onlevels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regionsand may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Uncertainties in the financial and creditmarkets have caused our customers to postpone deliveries of ordered systems and placement of neworders. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While webelieve we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if thecurrent market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times andgreater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.In addition, the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability ofcredit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, tofinance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell.

In addition, the volatile and unpredictablenature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us tosignificant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges ofapproximately $6.2 million, $4.6 million, and $10.0 million, respectively, primarily as a result ofchanges in customer forecasts.We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in,businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies.

On December 9, 2008 we closed our acquisition of Rasco and as required by FASBInterpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted forby the Purchase Method, the portion of the purchase price allocated to in-process research anddevelopment (IPR&D) was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition and therefore,$2.6 million related to IPR&D was included as an operating expense in our results of operations forthe year ended December 27, 2008.Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively managethese risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. At December 27, 2008 we had goodwill and purchased intangible assets balances of $60.8million and $41.0 million, respectively.A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.A small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our netsales. In the year ended December 27, 2008, three customers of the semiconductor equipment segmentaccounted for 51 % (63% in 2007, and 63% in 2006) of our net sales. During the past five years, thepercentage of our sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has variedgreatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase ofproducts from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry forcustomers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that ourcompetitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that wewill continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers.Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will varygreatly in future periods.

The test handler industry, whilerelatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductorequipment industry, has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intensecompetitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currentlysupply test handlers. The Japanese and Korean markets for test handling equipment are large andrepresent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. During the last five years we have hadonly limited sales to Japanese and Korean customers who have historically purchased test handlingequipment from Asian suppliers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial,engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and offer more extensive productofferings than Cohu. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies thatprovide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfullyagainst our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performanceof their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Ourfailure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors ofproducts with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectualproperty or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, ormargins on our existing products. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor testhandler market have intensified over the last several years.

Future technologies, processes and productdevelopments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be ableto develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to ourexisting products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance.Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customerrequirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing productsand services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our marketshare and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we mustadequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects inour engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party componentsincluded in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with ourcustomers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problemsand to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive andmay result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits.In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with newor existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverseeffect on our operating results.We utilize contract manufacturers and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, mayresult in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customerrelationships.Our reliance on contract manufacturers gives us less control over the manufacturing process andexposes us to significant risks, including limited control over capacity, late delivery, qualityand costs. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additionalcontract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage ourcontract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptionsor quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or addadditional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products toour11Table of Contentscustomers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contractmanufacturers may increase the complexity of our supply chain management. We cannot be certain thatexisting or future contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products on a timely andcost-effective basis, or to our quality and performance specifications. If our contractmanufacturers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability toship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.We have taken remedial measures to address slowdowns in the semiconductor equipment industry thatmay affect our ability to be competitive.In response to the weak business conditions in the back-end semiconductor equipment industry, wehave recently taken actions to reduce costs and conserve cash, including headcount reductions, paycuts, suspension of matching contribution to our 401(k) plan, reduced work hours and mandatory timeoff. Each of these measures could have long-term effects on our business by reducing our pool oftechnical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficultfor us to respond to our customers needs.Our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity.Our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of business, however, attimes it has been significantly in excess of revenue recognized in the following quarter. Due tothe possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delaysin product shipments, difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers, failure to satisfycustomer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accountingrequirements, our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in any futureperiod. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer withlimited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any particular period could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, ourbacklog at December 27, 2008, may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due todelayed delivery dates or customer requested changes to delivery schedules, order cancellations anddelays in recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changesin integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipmenthave a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce,particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes inworkforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newlyhired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees.Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experiencedifficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number ofadditions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with thecyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts innew operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfullyadjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changingrequirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business,financialposition and results of operations.We do not participate in the DRAM test handler market.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market. We do not participate in the DRAM market segment; therefore ourtotal available sales market is limited.We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to supportour sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doingbusiness abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting businessinternationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;12Table of Contents  longer payment cycles;   local political and economic conditions;   potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings andthe threat of double taxation; and   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs.Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associatedwith organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology,inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security mattersand cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, ourbusiness and results of operations will be adversely affected.Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United States export and otherregulations. Compliance with complex U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationalsales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and couldexpose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import andexport requirements and U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local lawsprohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulationscould result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitionson the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policiesand procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that ouremployees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will beeffective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions onour ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materiallydamage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract andretain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims ofviolations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming,result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incursignificant expenses.Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely andcost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts,components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a singlesupplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certaincomponents that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. Onoccasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of variousparts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially andadversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely andcost effective manner.We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particularamounts.We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodicdeterminations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of ourstockholders. Our dividend policy may be affected by, among other items, our views on potentialfuture capital requirements, including those related to research and development, creation andexpansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks and stockrepurchases.Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietaryrights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietaryrights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patentlife, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receivenotices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or withoutmerit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managementsattention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successfulclaim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technologyor to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and resultsof operations could be adversely affected.13Table of ContentsA majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, thatare subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.During the year ended December 27, 2008, 64.6% of our total net sales were exported to foreigncountries, including 72.0% of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment. The majority ofour export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularlyin Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type wemanufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliersthat have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantages include, amongother things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly largerorganizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domesticcustomers.The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results dependsubstantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound byemployment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significantpart upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical,engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel,particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting orretaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California area,where the majority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty inrecruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number ofpersons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions andit may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financialcondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any ofour key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, orby our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.Our non-semiconductor equipment businesses have generated losses or minimal profits.We develop, manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television and microwavecommunications applications. These products are sold in highly competitive markets and manycompetitors are segments of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial,engineering, marketing, manufacturing and customer support capabilities than Cohu. In addition,there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology in products that maycompete favorably against our own products. We have seen a significant decline in the operatingresults of our television camera business over the last several years with increasing losses andthe future prospects of this business remain uncertain. We may not be able to continue to competesuccessfully in these businesses.New accounting and tax rules will impact our future operating results.A change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significanteffect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varyinginterpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. These newaccounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results orthe way we conduct our business.Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   inventory writedowns;   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and   intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause themarket price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.14Table of ContentsWe have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $9.13 to $29.48. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of othercompanies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductorindustry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry,our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stocktrading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuatesignificantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.The occurrence of natural disasters in Asia and geopolitical instability caused by terroristattacks and threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales aremade to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have an operation in the Philippines that fabricatescertain component parts used in our products. These regions are known for being vulnerable tonatural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods and Avian (bird)flu, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake, tsunami or othergeological event could materially affect our operating results. We are not insured for most lossesand business interruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple sitecapacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business wouldsuffer"
17,COHU,COHU INC,2008-02-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, andthe other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable.Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on oursemiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent onthe overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry hasbeen highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have hada significant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, includingequipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductormanufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile and unpredictablenature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us tosignificant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges ofapproximately $4.6 million, $10.0 million, and $6.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result ofchanges in customer forecasts.A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.A small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our netsales. In the year ended December 29, 2007, three customers of the semiconductor equipment segmentaccounted for 63% (63% in 2006, and 67% in 2005) of our net sales. During the past five years, thepercentage of our sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has variedgreatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase ofproducts from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry forcustomers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that ourcompetitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that wewill continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers.Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will varygreatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or othersignificant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions, outsourcing finalsemiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have amaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely tocause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, ishighly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantialcompetition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, whilerelatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has aninordinately large number of participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures.Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. The Japaneseand Korean markets for test handling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage ofthe worldwide market. During the last five years we have had only limited sales to Japanese andKorean customers who have historically purchased test handling equipment from Asian suppliers.Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing andcustomer support capabilities and offer more extensive product offerings than Cohu. In addition,there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovativetechnology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our8Table of Contentscompetitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products andintroduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce newproducts in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived oractual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology couldresult in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existingproducts. We believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market haveintensified over the last several years. This intense competition has adversely impacted ourproduct average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reducethe cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expectthese competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in theforeseeable future.Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions andtransitions may result in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerousrisks and uncertainties.Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe thatour future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop newproducts with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily inresearch and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of newproducts, including the products obtained in our asset acquisitions with KryoTech and Unigen, mayadversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of newproducts by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number oflarge customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature ofour inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory maybecome obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increasedexposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-yearperiod ended December 29, 2007. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserverequirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financialcondition.The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment isan inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risksinclude potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integrationof the equipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes,transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment tosatisfy the semiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance atprices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductorequipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and finalmanufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate ofchange in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of thesechanges and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling andburn-in test equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition,not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences insuch processes make it difficult to design standard test products that are capable of achievingbroad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industrysfuture equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirementsand achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and markettrends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations,financial condition and results of operations.The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is adifficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipmentare common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volumeproduction of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our aftersale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products thanwith our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may renderour current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce andsuccessfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timelymanner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might notrealize acceptable profit margins on such products.9Table of ContentsIf we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customerrequirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing productsand services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our marketshare and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we mustadequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects inour engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party componentsincluded in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with ourcustomers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problemsand to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive andmay result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits.In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers andadversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in,businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions and investmentsinvolve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel,operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;   the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;   lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from theacquisition;   failure to commercialize purchased technology; and   the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significantcharges to operating results in future periods.Additionally, such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operatingresults. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability toeffectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We have taken remedial measures to address previous slowdowns in the semiconductor equipmentindustry that may affect our ability to be competitive.In the past, we have taken remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for ourproducts. In particular, we reduced our workforce, delayed salary increases, reduced seniorexecutives pay, implemented furloughs, reduced expense budgets and announced facilityconsolidations. Each of these measures could have long-term effects on our business by reducingour pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it moredifficult for us to respond to our customers needs.Our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity.Our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of business, however, attimes it has been significantly in excess of revenue recognized in the following quarter. Due tothe possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delaysin product shipments, difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers, failure to satisfycustomer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accountingrequirements, our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in any futureperiod. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer withlimited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any particular period could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our backlog atDecember 29, 2007, may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to delayeddelivery dates or customer requested changes to delivery schedules, order cancellations and delaysin recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changesin integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipmenthave a significant impact on our operations.10Table of ContentsTypically, we reduce and increase our workforce, particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes inworkforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newlyhired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees.Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experiencedifficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number ofadditions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with thecyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts innew operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfullyadjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changingrequirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business,financial position and results of operations.We do not participate in the gravity-feed and DRAM test handler markets.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market. In addition, gravity-feed test handlers are used in numerousnon-DRAM applications and continue to represent a significant portion of the worldwide test handlermarket. We do not participate in the DRAM and/or gravity-feed market segments; therefore our totalavailable sales market is limited.We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to supportour sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doingbusiness abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting businessinternationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   longer payment cycles;   local political and economic conditions;   potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings andthe threat of double taxation; and   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increase our costs.Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associatedwith organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology,inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security mattersand cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, ourbusiness and results of operations will be adversely affected.Compliance with export regulations may impact sales to foreign customers.Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with United States exportregulations. Compliance with such regulations could impact certain sales, and have a materialadverse effect on our operating results. In addition, failure to comply could subject us tosanctions that could negatively impact our operating results.11Table of ContentsFailure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely andcost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts,components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a singlesupplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certaincomponents that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. Onoccasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of variousparts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially andadversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely andcost effective manner.We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particularamounts.We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodicdeterminations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of ourstockholders. Our dividend policy may be affected by, among other items, our views on potentialfuture capital requirements, including those related to research and development, creation andexpansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks and stockrepurchases.Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietaryrights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietaryrights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patentlife, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receivenotices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or withoutmerit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managementsattention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successfulclaim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technologyor to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and resultsof operations could be adversely affected.A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, thatare subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.During the year ended December 29, 2007, 68.8% of our total net sales were exported to foreigncountries, including 74.0% of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment. The majority ofour export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularlyin Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type wemanufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliersthat have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantages include, amongother things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly largerorganizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domesticcustomers.The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results dependsubstantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound byemployment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significantpart upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical,engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel,particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting orretaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego, California area,where the majority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty inrecruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number ofpersons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions andit may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financialcondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any ofour key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, orby our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.12Table of ContentsOur non-semiconductor equipment businesses have generated losses.We develop, manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television and microwavecommunications applications. These products are sold in highly competitive markets and many competitors aresegments of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial, engineering,marketing, manufacturing and customer support capabilities than Cohu. In addition, there aresmaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology in products that may competefavorably against our own products. We have seen a significant decline in the operating results ofour television camera business over the last several years with increasing losses and the futureprospects of this business remain uncertain. We may not be able to continue to competesuccessfully in these businesses.New accounting and tax rules will impact our future operating results.A change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significanteffect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varyinginterpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. These newaccounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results orthe way we conduct our business.Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   inventory writedowns; and   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause themarket price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $14.11 to $29.48. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of othercompanies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductorindustry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry,our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stocktrading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuatesignificantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.Recently enacted and future changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs.Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules, arecreating challenges for publicly-held companies. We are committed to maintaining high standards ofcorporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws,regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increasedgeneral and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention fromrevenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to maintaincompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regardingour required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our externalauditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial andmanagerial resources. We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significantresources. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer couldface an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties.As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executiveofficers, which could harm our business.13Table of ContentsThe occurrence of natural disasters in Asia and geopolitical instability caused by terroristattacks and threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales aremade todestinations in Asia.

7,COHU,COHU INC,2007-02-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risksdescribed below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, andthe other information contained, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.The semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable.Visibility into our markets is limited. Our operating results are substantially dependent on oursemiconductor equipment business. This capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent onthe overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry hasbeen highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have hada significant effect on the semiconductor industrys demand for capital equipment, includingequipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductormanufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile andunpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future exposeus to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges ofapproximately $10.0 million, $6.1 million, and $5.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result ofchanges in customer forecasts.A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.A small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our netsales. In the year ended December 30, 2006, three customers of the semiconductor equipment segmentaccounted for 63% (67% in 2005, and 56% in 2004) of our net sales. During the past five years, thepercentage of our sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has variedgreatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers business and their purchase ofproducts from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor test handler industry forcustomers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that ourcompetitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that wewill continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers.Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will varygreatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or othersignificant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions, outsourcing finalsemiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have amaterial adverse impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to causesignificant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.The semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular, ishighly competitive.The semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantialcompetition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, whilerelatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductorequipment industry, has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intensecompetitive pricing pressures. Future competition may includecompanies that do not currently supply test handlers. The Japanese and Korean markets for testhandling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market.During the last five years we8Table of Contentshave had only limited sales to Japanese and Korean customers who havehistorically purchased test handling equipment from Asian suppliers. Some of our competitors havesubstantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities andoffer more extensive product offerings than Cohu. In addition, there are emerging semiconductorequipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products thatmay compete favorably against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve thedesign and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improvedperformance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, theintroduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes overrights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitiveposition and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. We believe that competitiveconditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years.This intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and grossmargins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products andsuccessfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negativelyimpact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions andtransitions may result in inventory write-offs and our new product development involves numerousrisks and uncertainties.Semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe thatour future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop newproducts with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily inresearch and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of newproducts, including the products obtained in our asset acquisitions with KryoTech and Unigen, mayadversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of newproducts by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number oflarge customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature ofour inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory maybecome obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This increasedexposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three-yearperiod ended December 30, 2006. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserverequirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financialcondition.The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment isan inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risksinclude potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integrationof the equipment with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes,transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment tosatisfy the semiconductor industrys constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance atprices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductorequipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and finalmanufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate ofchange in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of thesechanges and other factors, assessing the market potential andcommercial viability of handling and burn-in testequipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not allintegrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in suchprocesses make it difficult to design standard products that are capable ofachieving broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductorindustrys future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet suchrequirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements andmarket trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on ouroperations, financial condition and results of operations.The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is adifficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipmentare common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing andvolume production of our newequipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, our after sale support andwarranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our establishedproducts. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or futureproduct offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfullymanufacture new products or make9Table of Contentsenhancements to our existing products in a timely manner tosatisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realizeacceptable profit margins on such products.If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customerrequirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing productsand services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customerschanging needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our marketshare and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we mustadequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects inour engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third party componentsincluded in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with ourcustomers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problemsand to determine appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive andmay result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits.In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers andadversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.We are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments.We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in,businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions and investmentsinvolve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of thepersonnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;   the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;   lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   failure to commercialize purchased technology; and   the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result insignificant charges to operating results in future periods.Additionally, such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operatingresults. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability toeffectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We have taken remedial measures to address previous slowdowns in the semiconductor equipmentindustry that may affect our ability to be competitive.In the past, we have taken remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for ourproducts. In particular, we reduced our workforce, delayed salary increases, reduced seniorexecutives pay, implemented furloughs, reduced expense budgets and announced facilityconsolidations. Each of these measures could have long-term effects on our business by reducingour pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it moredifficult for us to respond to our customers needs.Our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity.Our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of business, however,during the last year it has been significantly in excess of revenue recognized in the followingquarter. Due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders,potential delays in product shipments, difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers,failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue underaccounting requirements, our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in anyfuture period. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by thecustomer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any particular period could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inaddition, our backlog atDecember 30, 2006, may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to delayeddelivery dates or customer requested changes to delivery schedules, order cancellations and delaysin recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements.10Table of ContentsThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changesin integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipmenthave a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce,particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes inworkforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newlyhired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees.Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experiencedifficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number ofadditions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with thecyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts innew operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfullyadjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changingrequirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business,financial position and results of operations.We do not participate in the gravity-feed and DRAM test handler markets.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market. In addition, gravity-feed testhandlers are used in numerous non-DRAM applications and continue to represent a significant portion of the worldwide test handlermarket. We do not participate in the DRAM and/or gravity-feed market segments; our total availablesales market is limited.We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to supportour sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doingbusiness abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting businessinternationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   longer payment cycles;   local political and economic conditions;   potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriatingearnings and the threat of double taxation; and   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increaseour costs.Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associatedwith organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology,inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security mattersand cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, ourbusiness and results of operations will be adversely affected.Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely andcost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts,components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a singlesupplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certaincomponents that are difficult to replacewithout significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems inobtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain keysuppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receivesufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner.We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particularamounts.We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodicdeterminations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our dividendpolicy may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,including those related to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distributionchannels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks and stock repurchases.11Table of ContentsThird parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietaryrights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietaryrights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patentlife, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time to time, we receivenotices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or withoutmerit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managementsattention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successfulclaim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technologyor to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and resultsof operations could be adversely affected.A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, thatare subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.During the year ended December 30, 2006, 76.0% of our total net sales were exported to foreigncountries, including 83.4% of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment. The majority ofour export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularlyin Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type wemanufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliersthat have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantages include, amongother things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly largerorganizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domesticcustomers.The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results dependsubstantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound byemployment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significantpart upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical,engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel,particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting orretaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in San Diego, California, where themajority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty in recruitingprospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with therequisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may becomeincreasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our keyemployees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by ourinability to attract and retain skilled employees.Our non-semiconductor equipment businesses have generated losses.We develop, manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television and microwavecommunications applications. These products are sold in highly competitive markets and manycompetitors are segments of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial,engineering, marketing, manufacturing and customer support capabilities than Cohu. In addition,there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovativetechnology in products that may compete favorably against our own products. We have seen asignificant decline in the operating results of our television camera business over the lastseveral years with increasing losses and the future prospects of this business remain uncertain.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully in these businesses.New accounting and tax rules will impact our future operating results.A change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significanteffect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varyinginterpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. These newaccounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results orthe way we conduct our business.12Table of ContentsOur financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   inventory writedowns; and   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $13.69 to $29.48. The price of our stock may be more volatile than other companies dueto, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, oursignificant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limitedbacklog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume.The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in thefuture, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.Recentlyenacted and future changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs.Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules, arecreating challenges for publicly-held companies. We are committed to maintaining high standards ofcorporate governance and public disclosure.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of theseknown or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Cohu, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.Risks Relating to the Industries in Which We Compete and Our BusinessThe semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable.Visibility into our markets is limited.

We anticipate that the markets for newergenerations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles andsevere downturns, such as those experienced in 2001, 2002, 2003 and during the third and fourthquarters of 2004. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductormanufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the volatile andunpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future exposeus to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write-offs and reserverequirements. In the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recorded pretaxinventory-related charges of approximately $6.2 million, $5.8 million, $4.6 million, respectively,primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts.A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.A relatively small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portionof our net sales. In the year ended December 31, 2005, three customers of the semiconductorequipment segment accounted for 63% (54% in 2004, and 58% in 2003) of our net sales.

Acquisitions and investmentsinvolve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:  difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of thepersonnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;   diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;   the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;   lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;   failure to commercialize purchased technology; and   the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result insignificant charges to operating results in future periods.Additionally, such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operatingresults. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability toeffectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We have taken remedial measures to address previous slowdowns in the semiconductor equipmentindustry that may affect our ability to be competitive.In the past, we have taken remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for ourproducts. In particular, we reduced our workforce, delayed salary increases, reduced seniorexecutives pay, implemented furloughs, reduced expense budgets and announced facilityconsolidations including Delta Designs Columbus, Ohio and Littleton, Massachusetts operations intoour Poway, California facility. Each of these measures could have long-term effects on ourbusiness by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in ourproducts and making it more difficult for us to respond to our customers needs.Our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity.Our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of revenue and as aresult our visibility of future business activity is limited. Due to the possibility of customerchanges in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments,difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers, failure to satisfy customer acceptancerequirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements, our backlog atany point in time may not be representative of sales in any future period. Furthermore, all ordersare subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalty. A reduction inbacklog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our backlog at December 31, 2005, maynot be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to delayed delivery dates or customerrequested changes to delivery schedules, order cancellations and delays in recognizing revenue dueto accounting requirements.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on ouremployees, operations and infrastructure.The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes indemand for its products. Changes in product demand result from a number of factors including thesemiconductor industrys continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changesin integrated circuit design and packaging. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipmenthave a significant impact on our operations. Typically, we reduce and increase our workforce,particularly in manufacturing, based on customer demand for our products. These changes inworkforce levels place enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure since newlyhired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees.Additionally, these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities andadversely impact employee morale. We have in the past and may in the future experiencedifficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number ofadditions to our workforce. The volatility in10Table of Contentsheadcount and business levels, combined with thecyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts innew operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfullyadjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changingrequirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business,financial position and results of operations.We do not participate in the gravity-feed and DRAM test handler markets.Pick-and-place handlers used in DRAM applications account for a significant portion of theworldwide test handler market and our market share in the DRAM segment is negligible. In addition,gravity-feed test handlers are used in numerous non DRAM applications and continue to represent asignificant portion of the worldwide test handler market. Because we do not participate in the DRAMand/or gravity-feed market segments, our total available sales market is limited.We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world to support our sales andservices to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroadthat we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationallycould negatively impact our operating results, including:  costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;   longer payment cycles;   local political and economic conditions;   potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriatingearnings and the threat of double taxation; and   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand and increaseour costs.Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associatedwith organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology,inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security mattersand cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, ourbusiness and results of operations will be adversely affected.Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely andcost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of ourproducts. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts,components and subassemblies. As a result, certain key parts may be available only from a singlesupplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certaincomponents that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. Onoccasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of variousparts and components from certain key suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially andadversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely andcost effective manner.We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particularamounts.We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodicdeterminations that cash dividends are in the best interest of the stockholders. Our dividendpolicy may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,including those related to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distributionchannels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks and stock repurchases.11Table of ContentsThird parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietaryrights.We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietaryrights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patentlife, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and certain of these patent rights arelicensed from third parties and we may not be able to negotiate extensions of any such licensesthat have or may expire and these rights may cease to provide significant competitive advantages.In addition, from time to time, we receive notices from third partiesregarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming todefend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources and cause us toincur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and ourfailure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringingtechnology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adverselyaffected.A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, thatare subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian testhandling equipment suppliers.During the year ended December 31, 2005, 75.4% of our total net sales were exported to foreigncountries, including 85.4% of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment. The majority ofour export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularlyin Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type wemanufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliersthat have certain advantages over U.S. suppliers, including us. These advantages include, amongother things, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly largerorganizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asiacould impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domesticcustomers.The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results dependsubstantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound byemployment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significantpart upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical,engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel,particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting orretaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in San Diego, California, where themajority of our personnel are located, is very high and we have had difficulty in recruitingprospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with therequisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may becomeincreasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our keyemployees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by ourinability to attract and retain skilled employees.Our non-semiconductor equipment businesses have experienced little or no growth and have generatedsignificant losses.We develop, manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television, metal detection andmicrowave communications applications. These products are sold in highly competitive markets andmany competitors are segments of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial,engineering, marketing, manufacturing and customer support capabilities than Cohu. In addition,there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology in products that maycompete favorably against our own products. We have seen a significant decline in the operatingresults of these businesses over the last several years with increasing losses and the futureprospects for certain of these businesses remain uncertain. We may not be able to continue tocompete successfully in these businesses.New accounting rules will impact our future operating results.A change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significanteffect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varyinginterpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. These newaccounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results orthe way we conduct our business.12Table of ContentsFor example, under Statement No. 123R, in 2006, we will be required to account for equity under ourstock plans as a compensation expense and our net income and net income per share will besignificantly reduced. Currently, we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on netincome and net income per share, as well as the impact of all stock-based compensation expense in afootnote to the consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 123R requires that we expenseshare-based payment awards given to employees, including sharesissued under employee stock purchase plans and stock options, as compensation cost. As a result,our adoption of the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 could negatively affect ourstock price and our stock price volatility.Our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates, which maycause the price of our common stock to decline.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including,but not limited to:  timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers;   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;   impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations;   inventory writedowns; and   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers.Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operatingresults may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time to timeour quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industryanalysts who publish reports on our company or of investors generally. This could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. In recent years, the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, includingours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operatingperformance of affected companies. During the last three years the price of our common stock hasranged from $13.01 to $27.39. The price of our stock may be more volatile than other companies dueto, among other factors, the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, oursignificant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limitedbacklog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume.The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in thefuture, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.Recently enacted and future changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs.Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq National Market rules, arecreating challenges for all publicly-held companies. We are committed to maintaining highstandards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply withevolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in,increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention fromrevenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to maintaincompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regardingour required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our externalauditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial andmanagerial resources. We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significantresources. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer couldface an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties.As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executiveofficers, which could harm our business.13Table of ContentsThe occurrence of natural disasters in Asia and geopolitical instability caused by terroristattacks and threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.Our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales aremade to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have an operation in the Philippines that fabricatescertain component parts used in our semiconductor test handlers. These regions are known for beingvulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods andAvian (bird) flu, which at times have disrupted the local economies. A significant earthquake ortsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and businessinterruptions of this kind, and do not presently have redundant, multiple site capacity in theevent of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer.Furthermore, BMS is currently involved in a significant contract with the United Arab Emirates.Continued terrorist attacks orthreats in this region may cause geopolitical instability that may have an adverse effect on ourability to successfully satisfy customer acceptance requirements and recognize revenue under theagreement, which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition"
