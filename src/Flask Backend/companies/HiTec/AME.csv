You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Our OperationsOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated, experience cyclicality, or a general downturn in the economy could adversely affect our business. A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. A number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in 10Table of Contentscustomer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company’s highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations. International sales for 2023 and 2022 represented 47.4% and 48.7% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2023, we have manufacturing operations in 20 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in Canada, China, France, Germany, Mexico, Serbia, Poland and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including: •Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;•Overlap of different tax structures, including the development of a global minimum tax;•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;•Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;•The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•Restrictions on currency repatriation;•General economic conditions;•Unstable political situations and social unrest, both internationally and in the United States;•Increasing trade tensions between the United States and certain countries, including China;•Nationalization of assets; and•Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our 11Table of Contentsproducts sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products. 12Table of ContentsOur technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations. While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components, including semiconductor chips and other electronic components, from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.13Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to monitor,  manage, and support a variety of critical business processes and activities including receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations. Despite our implementation of certain controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, these systems, products, data and services may be damaged, compromised, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Further, we also face information security risks due to our reliance on internet technology and use of hybrid work arrangements, which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunity for cyber-attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Further, given the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the complexity of techniques used, any of these attacks or breaches could potentially persist for an extended period before being detected.  As a result, it could take a significant time before an investigation can be completed and new disclosure regulations could result in us being required to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been mitigated or resolved, or even fully investigated.  Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. 14Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our AcquisitionsOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions. A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including: •Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;•The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;•Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;•Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;•Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;•Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and•Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We may also obtain representation and warranty insurance to address certain potential risks and liabilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions and insurance policies will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. Risks Related to Our Financial ConditionCertain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air 15Table of Contentsemissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements. Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt 16Table of ContentsFacility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $10,612.9 million or 71% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Our OperationsThe coronavirus global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions.We continue to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19, and any other significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, could have a negative effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and the end markets for many of our products, which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.Our global manufacturing facilities remain open with a focus on safety protocols, though a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control have restricted our ability to keep our manufacturing facilities fully operational. Any decline or lower than expected demand in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and suppliers in the future or their ability to purchase Company products, may delay customers’ purchasing decisions, result in a shift to lower-priced products or away from discretionary products, and may result in longer payment terms or inability to collect customer payments. These issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions.In compliance with stay-at-home orders issued in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home. As a result, more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and IT security may be less robust. This change may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems 11Table of Contentssecurity, which could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues.If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines or absenteeism; government actions; facility closures; work slowdowns or stoppages; limited supplies or resources; or other circumstances related to COVID-19, our operations will be further impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our customer obligations and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result. The continued spread of COVID-19 may also affect our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and our ability in short periods to fully maintain and support our corporate culture.A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have significant negative impact on the Company, its suppliers, and its customers to conduct business in the future. Risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending, which impact domestic and cross-border spend, are described in our risk factor titled “Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations”.The duration and intensity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain but could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions. We will continue to assess the financial impact of the pandemic on our business. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business. A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. A number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company’s highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. 12Table of ContentsForeign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations. International sales for 2022 and 2021 represented 48.7% and 49.5% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we have manufacturing operations in 18 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, Czechia, Germany, Mexico, Serbia and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including: •Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;•Overlap of different tax structures;•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;•Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;•The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•Restrictions on currency repatriation;•General economic conditions;•Unstable political situations and social unrest, both internationally and in the United States;•Increasing trade tensions between the United States and certain countries, including China;•Nationalization of assets; and•Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, 13Table of Contentsdisruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a 15Table of Contentsvariety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Further, given a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home, disaster recovery may take longer to complete. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. Risks Related to Our AcquisitionsOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions. A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including: •Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;•The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;•Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;•Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;•Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;•Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and•Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.16Table of ContentsThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. Risks Related to Our Financial ConditionCertain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and 17Table of Contentsregulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements. Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2022, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $8,714.6 million or 70% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an $8.6 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the Company's trade names. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
2,AME,AMETEK INC,2022-02-22,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Our OperationsThe coronavirus global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions.We continue to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19, and any other significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, could have a negative effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and the end markets for many of our products, which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.Our global manufacturing facilities remain open with a focus on safety protocols, though a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control have restricted our ability to keep our manufacturing facilities fully operational. Any decline or lower than expected demand in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and suppliers in the future or their ability to purchase Company products, may delay customers’ purchasing decisions, result in a shift to lower-priced products or away from discretionary products, and may result in longer payment terms or inability to collect customer payments. These issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions.In compliance with stay-at-home orders issued in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home. As a result, more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and IT security may be less robust. This change may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues.11Table of ContentsIf significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines or absenteeism; government actions; facility closures; work slowdowns or stoppages; limited supplies or resources; or other circumstances related to COVID-19, our operations will be further impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our customer obligations and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result. The continued spread of COVID-19 may also affect our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and our ability in short periods to fully maintain and support our corporate culture.A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have significant negative impact on the Company, its suppliers, and its customers to conduct business in the future. Risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending, which impact domestic and cross-border spend, are described in our risk factor titled “Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations”.The duration and intensity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain but could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions. We will continue to assess the financial impact of the pandemic on our business. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business. A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. A number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company’s highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. 12Table of ContentsForeign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations. International sales for 2021 and 2020 represented 49.5% and 48.7% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Serbia and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including: •Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;•Overlap of different tax structures;•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;•Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;•The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•Restrictions on currency repatriation;•General economic conditions;•Unstable political situations and social unrest, both internationally and in the United States;•Nationalization of assets; and•Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.13Table of ContentsOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products. Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations. While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components, including semiconductor chips and other electronic 14Table of Contentscomponents, from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system 15Table of Contentsredundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Further, given a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home, disaster recovery may take longer to complete. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. Risks Related to Our AcquisitionsOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions. A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including: •Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;•The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;•Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;•Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;•Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;•Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and•Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.16Table of ContentsThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. Risks Related to Our Financial ConditionCertain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and 17Table of Contentsregulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements. Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $8,607.4 million or 72% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
0,AME,AMETEK INC,2021-02-18,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Our OperationsThe coronavirus global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19, and any other significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, could have a negative effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and the end markets for many of our products, which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.8Table of ContentsOur global manufacturing facilities remain open with a focus on safety protocols, though a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control have restricted our ability to keep our manufacturing facilities fully operational. Additionally, while our global supply chains are currently not materially affected, it is unknown whether and to what extent they may be affected if the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period. Any decline or lower than expected demand in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and suppliers in the future or their ability to purchase Company products, may delay customers’ purchasing decisions, result in a shift to lower-priced products or away from discretionary products, and may result in longer payment terms or inability to collect customer payments. These issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions.In compliance with stay-at-home orders issued in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home. As a result, more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and IT security may be less robust. This change may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues.If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines or absenteeism; government actions; facility closures; work slowdowns or stoppages; limited supplies or resources; or other circumstances related to COVID-19, our operations will be further impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our customer obligations and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result. The continued spread of COVID-19 may also affect our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and our ability in short periods to fully maintain and support our corporate culture.A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have significant negative impact on the Company, its suppliers, and its customers to conduct business in the future. Risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending, which impact domestic and cross-border spend, are described in our risk factor titled “Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations”.The duration and intensity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain but could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions. We will continue to assess the financial impact of the pandemic on our business. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business. A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. A number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our 9Table of Contentsbusinesses, demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company’s highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations. International sales for 2020 and 2019 represented 48.7% and 48.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Serbia and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including: •Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;•Overlap of different tax structures;•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;•Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;•The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•Restrictions on currency repatriation;•General economic conditions;•Unstable political situations and social unrest, both internationally and in the United States;•Nationalization of assets; and•Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our 10Table of Contentsconsolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products. 11Table of ContentsOur technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations. While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, supplier’s allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our 12Table of Contentsproducts or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Further, given a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home, disaster recovery may take longer to complete. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. Risks Related to Our AcquisitionsOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions. A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2016, through December 31, 2020, we have completed 17 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including: •Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;•The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;•Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;•Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;•Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;13Table of Contents•Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and•Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. Risks Related to Our Financial ConditionCertain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance 14Table of Contentscoverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements. Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $6,848.6 million or 66% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"

  You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.  A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.  Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2015, through December 31, 2019, we have completed 18 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:   •Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;        11     Table of Contents  •The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities;      •Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      •Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;      •Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;      •Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and      •Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.     The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.  Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it.

We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.  We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives.  Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company’s highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations.  Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations.  International sales for 2019 and 2018 represented 48.0% and 50.5% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2019, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Serbia and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change     12      Table of Contents  in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:   •Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;      •Overlap of different tax structures;      •Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;      •Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;      •The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;      •Restrictions on currency repatriation;      •General economic conditions;      •Unstable political situations;      •Nationalization of assets; and      •Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.     Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.  Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.  We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary  penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.  We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with)     13      Table of Contents  that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.  If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.  Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.  A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations.  While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, supplier’s allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing     14      Table of Contents  price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.  Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities. We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. For example, we are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.     15      Table of Contents      We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.  We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements.  We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.  Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.  Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.     16      Table of Contents  Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems.  We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.  Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2019, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $6,810.4 million or 69% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
1,AME,AMETEK INC,2019-02-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adverselyaffect our business.  A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore areaffected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and servicesdecline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.  Our growth depends in part on the growth of themarkets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing oforders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Anumber of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Mattersof public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may beaffected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integraterecent and future acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategicbusinesses. Since the beginning of 2014, through December 31, 2018, we have completed 21 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although wehave been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:      Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our abilityto consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological andoperational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseenoperating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated,the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   12 Table of ContentsThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may notfully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.  Certain of the acquisition agreements bywhich we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limitedand certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adverselyaffect our financial statements.  We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our OperationalExcellence initiatives.  Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings orother benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Companys highly competitive industries. These initiatives are oftencomplex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales andoperations.  International sales for 2018 and 2017 represented 50.5% and 51.5% of our consolidated net sales,respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States.As of December 31, 2018, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Serbia and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtaina supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks ofoperating in an international environment, including:      Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;     Overlap of different tax structures;     Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;     Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers,including in the United States;      The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverseregions and employee bases;      Restrictions on currency repatriation;     General economic conditions;     Unstable political situations;     Nationalization of assets; and     Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.  13 Table of ContentsFurthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, includingchanges in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effectiveprice of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales andexpenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value ofthese items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.  Our international sales andoperations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.  We are required to comply with variousimport, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certaincircumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. Inaddition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and exportproducts and services and damage to our reputation.  Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impairedby improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.  We cannot provide assurance that ourinternal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/ornon-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export andimport compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from makingimproper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of suchacts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary andnon-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of suchstandards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.  Any inability to hire, train andretain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrateacquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expensenecessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  If we are unable todevelop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.  We believe that ourfuture success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing   14 Table of Contentstechnological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make suchinvestments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or newproducts which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.

A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one ormore of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, resultin lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from alimited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affectour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable forcosts associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental andoccupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials atsuch property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials.

In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, thediscovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in futureliabilities.  We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. Inaddition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. Forexample, we are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions,but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and otherjurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incursubstantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adverselyaffect our financial statements.  We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatoryproceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters,tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits mayinclude claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we maybe required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient orunavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilitiesor assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities inconnection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do notbelieve that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financialstatements.   16 Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations orability to expand our business.  Our markets are highly competitive.

Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit ourability to incur additional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (eacha Debt Facility and collectively, Debt Facilities) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions,limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliancewith specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of thesecovenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of defaultunder a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If thiswere to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness. Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, ourinformation technology systems.  We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed bythird-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and tomanage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractualobligations). These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utilityfailures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored ortransmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computerviruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interruptour operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and  17 Table of Contentsour reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each ofwhich could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantialgoodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2018, goodwill andother intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $6,015.8 million or 69% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and otheridentifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fallsignificantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determinationrequiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
14,AME,AMETEK INC,2018-02-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adverselyaffect our business.  A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore areaffected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.  Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline,do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.  Our growth depends in part on the growth of the marketswhich we serve and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter,which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate inindustries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and governmentbudget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced pricechanges, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integraterecent and future acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategicbusinesses. Since the beginning of 2013, through December 31, 2017, we have completed 18 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although wehave been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:      Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect ourability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological andmanagement processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;   11 Table of Contents   U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseenoperating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated,the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The indemnification provisions ofacquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us againstcertain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnificationresponsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoingproduction and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Companys highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure toimplement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales andoperations.  International sales for 2017 and 2016 represented 51.5% and 52.4% of our consolidated net sales,respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States.As of December 31, 2017, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Serbia. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goodsfrom these countries or a change in the effective cost of these products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an internationalenvironment, including:      Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;     Overlap of different tax structures;     Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;   12 Table of Contents   Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers,including in the United States;      The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverseregions and employee bases;      Restrictions on currency repatriation;     General economic conditions;     Unstable political situations;     Nationalization of assets; and     Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative valueof currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products soldoverseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses intoU.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these itemsin our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.  Our international sales and operations maybe adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.  We are required to comply with various import, export,export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances,export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition,failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export productsand services and damage to our reputation.  Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired byimproper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.  We cannot provide assurance that ourinternal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/ornon-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export andimport compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from makingimproper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of suchacts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary andnon-monetary penalties and could cause us to   13 Table of Contentsincur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct couldoccur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.  Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number ofskilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.  If we cannot hire, trainand retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably growour business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advancedproducts that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and developmentand sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recovermajor research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able todevelop and successfully market new products.  Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technologycould put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, weendeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties orcompetitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights mayresult in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.  Ashortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.  While we manufacturecertain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject tocurtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, certain items, including base metals andcertain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and ourcompetitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certainenvironmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental andoccupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air   14 Table of Contentsemissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in manyof our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether theowner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentiallyresponsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose ofvarious hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impactof pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws andregulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirementscould require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmentalliabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities. We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition,existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such newlaws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.  We aresubject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or thebusiness operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competitionand sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitiveand consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlementsor become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Inaddition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonableestimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal andregulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to payin connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements.   15 Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations or ability to expand our business.  Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically andinternationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service,distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of productquality, performance and innovation. EMGs competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt morereadily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able tocompete successfully with those of our competitors.  Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debtagreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility andother debt agreements (each a Debt Facility and collectively, Debt Facilities) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability toeffectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operatingresults and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants andrequirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon theoccurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to beimmediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents, and other information technology andbusiness disruptions.  Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, products and information technologysystems may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including cybersecurity attacks, other information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, armed conflict, as well as damagingweather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. For example, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, cyberattacks or other securitybreach, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications or utility failures, or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning and security upgrade efforts may be ineffectiveor inadequate. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, our distribution system, our products or our information technology, telecommunications or other systems, could significantly disrupt ouroperations, delay production and shipments, our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure andlarge remediation or other expenses.   16 Table of ContentsOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of ourtotal assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2017, goodwill andother intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $5,129.0 million or 66% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and otheridentifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fallsignificantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determinationrequiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
6,AME,AMETEK INC,2017-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents weincorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business. A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond ourcontrol. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  10 Table of ContentsOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do notgrow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.  Our growth depends in part on the growth of themarkets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscalquarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operatein industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy andgovernment budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announcedprice changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent andfuture acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategicbusinesses. Since the beginning of 2012, through December 31, 2016, we have completed 22 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although wehave been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:     Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions onfavorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controlsof the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;     U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operatingdifficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, theacquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   11 Table of ContentsThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may notfully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.  Certain of the acquisitionagreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the formerowners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilitiesthat adversely affect our financial statements.  We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, ourcost reduction initiatives.  Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizingcost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the companys highly competitive industry. Theseinitiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations.  Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations. International sales for 2016 and 2015 represented 52.4% and 51.7% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As aresult of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States. We havemanufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic and Mexico. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in theeffective cost of these products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:     Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;     Overlap of different tax structures;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;     Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;     The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;     Restrictions on currency repatriation;      General economic conditions;      Unstable political situations;      Nationalization of assets; and      Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.   12 Table of ContentsFurthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, includingchanges in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effectiveprice of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales andexpenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value ofthese items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.  Our internationalsales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.  We are required tocomply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees andsubsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license beforeexporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export productsand services and damage to our reputation.  Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improperconduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.  We cannot provide assurance that ourinternal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the lawsgoverning payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining orretaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminalinvestigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Inaddition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to competesuccessfully.  If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we maynot be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficientnumber of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologicallyadvanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require  13 Table of Contentsus to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able tomake the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existingproducts obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.  Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rightsthrough patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use ourproducts or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesand we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.  A shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials couldincrease our operating costs.  While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products,we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things,suppliers allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only froma limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affectour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable forcosts associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.  Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things,air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain lawsprovide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsiblefor, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributinghazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation offacilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it isnot possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financialposition or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition ofnew clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance thatfuture environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.   14 Table of ContentsWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significantcosts.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws andregulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannotpredict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.  We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or thebusiness operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competitionand sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitiveand consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlementsor become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Inaddition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonableestimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal andregulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to payin connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements. We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individualproducers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. EMGscompetition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the aerospace and heavy-vehicle marketsserved by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to newtechnologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfullywith those of our competitors.  Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our abilityto incur additional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements(each a Debt Facility and collectively, Debt Facilities) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate futureacquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our   15 Table of Contentsability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintaincompliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breachof these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event ofdefault under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Ifthis were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems may be impacted by natural orman-made disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, armed conflict, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. For example, our informationtechnology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications or utility failures, or other unforeseen events, andin any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, our distribution system, or our information technology,telecommunications or other systems, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage customer relationships and our reputation, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or resultin legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses.  Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount ofour total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2016,goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $4,553.0 million or 64% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible andother identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $13.9 million non-cashimpairment charge related to certain of the Companys trade names. For further discussion, see Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations andNote 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below currentlevels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or otherintangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.   "

  You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate byreference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business. Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond ourcontrol. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integraterecent and future acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions ofstrategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2011, through December 31, 2015, we have completed 22 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Althoughwe have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:     Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions onfavorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controlsof the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;     U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operatingdifficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, theacquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   11 Table of ContentsWe may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our cost reductioninitiatives.  Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings orother benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives, including the relocation of manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in thecompanys highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations. Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations. International sales for 2015 and 2014 represented 51.7% and 54.6% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As aresult of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States. We havemanufacturing operations in 18 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in China, the Czech Republic and Mexico. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a materialadverse effect on our operations. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:      Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;     Overlap of different tax structures;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;      The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;     Restrictions on currency repatriation;      General economic conditions;      Unstable political situations;      Nationalization of assets; and      Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies inthe countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which mayadversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reportingpurposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, evenif their value has not changed in their local currency.   12 Table of ContentsOur international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws,which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctionsregulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of theseregulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to competesuccessfully.  If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedemployees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retaina sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologicallyadvanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research anddevelopment and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we canrecover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will beable to develop and successfully market new products.  Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect thistechnology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Many of our products rely on proprietarytechnology; therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights,unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions toenforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.  A shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.  While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state,local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us orcustomers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.  We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products isalleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from futureclaims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for whichthird-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   14 Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations orability to expand our business.

In addition, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases thereforecould affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental andoccupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the   13 Table of Contentscosts of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardousmaterials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sitesdesignated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture,store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantifythe potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could requireus to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will notoccur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.  We are subject to numerousgovernmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.  Our operations aresubject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may beadopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations. We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products isalleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from futureclaims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for whichthird-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well aswith vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. EMGs competition in specialtymetal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limitednumber of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changingrequirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of ourcompetitors.   14 Table of ContentsRestrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit ourability to incur additional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility and other debtagreements contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to makecapital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet thefinancial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financialratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders couldelect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our otherindebtedness.  Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other businessdisruptions.  Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systemsmay be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, armed conflict, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. Forexample, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications or utility failures, orother unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, our distribution system, or ourinformation technology, telecommunications or other systems, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage customer relationships and our reputation, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation orcorruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses.  Our goodwill and other intangible assetsrepresent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2014,goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $4,239.6 million or 66% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible andother identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fallsignificantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significantportion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.   "

  You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents weincorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or power markets could adversely affect our business. Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected byfactors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent andfuture acquisitions.  A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategicbusinesses. Since the beginning of 2009, through December 31, 2013, we have completed 24 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although wehave been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:     Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions onfavorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controlsof the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;   11 Table of Contents   Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;     U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operatingdifficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, theacquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may experience unanticipated start-up expensesand production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.  Certain of our businessesare relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of ourexisting facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.  Oursubstantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations.  International sales for 2013 and 2012 represented 55.2% and 51.2% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside theUnited States will increase in the future. Approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the United States. We have manufacturing operations in 15 countries outside the United States, with significant operationsin China, the Czech Republic and Mexico. A prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations. International operations are subject to the customary risks ofoperating in an international environment, including:      Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;     Overlap of different tax structures;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjectingus to exchange rate exposures;      Restrictions on currency repatriation;      General economic conditions;      Unstable political situations;   12 Table of Contents   Nationalization of assets; and      Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect ourtransactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibitthe export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result incivil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.  Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectivelyintegrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, theexpense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  If we are unableto develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.  Webelieve that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and otheradvantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, thatwe will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which couldrender our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.  A shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.  We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, areavailable only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, whichcould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certain environmental risks may causeus to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.  Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things,air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.

We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings.Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:     Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;     The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions onfavorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;      Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controlsof the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;      Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;     U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;     Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;     Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and     Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operatingdifficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, theacquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may experience unanticipated start-up expensesand production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.  Certain of our businessesare relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of ourexisting facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.   12 Table of ContentsOur substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated withinternational operations.  International sales for 2011 and 2010 represented 50.2% and 49.0% of ourconsolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating inan international environment, including:      Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;     Overlap of different tax structures;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;      Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjectingus to exchange rate exposures;      Restrictions on currency repatriation;      General economic conditions;      Unstable political situations;      Nationalization of assets; and      Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws. We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect ourtransactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibitthe export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result incivil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.  Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectivelyintegrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, theexpense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  If we are unableto develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.  Webelieve that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain  13 Table of Contentstechnological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be noassurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. Weare not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products. A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs. We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affectthe prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental andoccupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials atsuch property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint andseveral liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject ofgovernment-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation andcapital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of thesematters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws andregulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities. We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition,existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such newlaws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.  We may berequired to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, ouroperations expose us to   14 Table of Contentspotential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur asignificant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will beadequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We operate in highly competitiveindustries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business. Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well aswith vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price, product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in specialtymetal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served byEIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies orchanging requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those ofour competitors.  Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incuradditional indebtedness.  Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements containrestrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility. We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties. We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, creditfacilities, financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligationsunder such contracts.  Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment ofsuch substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2,789.2million or 65% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annuallywhether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accountingrules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financialcondition and results of operations.   "

As a result    of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of    sales outside the United States will increase in the future.    International operations are subject to the customary risks of    operating in an international environment, including:           Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;           Overlap of different tax structures;           Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;           Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;    12Table of Contents           Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;           Restrictions on currency repatriation;           General economic conditions;           Unstable political situations;           Nationalization of assets; and           Compliance with a wide variety of international and    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Our    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by    compliance with export laws.     We are required to comply with various import, export, export    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the    export of certain products, services and technologies and in    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export    license before exporting a controlled item.

Although we believe we have certain technological and other    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages    will require us to continue investing in research and    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,    that we will be able to make the technological advances    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can    recover major research and development expenses. We are not    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able    to develop and successfully market new products. A    shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could    increase our operating costs.     We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel    components, are available only from a limited number of    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.

Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous    materials.

16,AME,AMETEK INC,2010-02-25,">Item 1A.      Risk    Factors     You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all    other information contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial    condition. Current    economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could    adversely affect our results of operations and financial    condition.     The global economy has recently undergone a period of    unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets, as    well as a general slowdown in demand, including in many of the    end markets we serve. A prolonged period of economic decline or    stagnation could have a material adverse effect on our results    of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other    risk factors we have described below. These economic    developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways.    Our global business is adversely affected by decreases in the    general level of economic activity, such as decreases in    business and consumer spending, capital spending, air travel,    industrial production and government procurement. Any economic    slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for    our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of    our customers to make timely payments. In addition, the    potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to    experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased.    Furthermore, a disparate impact on, or government actions    affecting, one of the major economies could produce volatility    in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain    major currencies, adversely affecting our results. We are unable    to predict the timing, duration and severity of any further    disruptions in financial markets or adverse economic conditions    in the U.S. and other countries. A    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely    affect our business.     Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. Our    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate    recent and future acquisitions.     A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2005, through    December 31, 2009, we have completed 24 acquisitions. We    plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our    global market position and broaden our product offerings.    Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies    in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions    will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:           Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;           The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a    greater portion of the sellers liabilities;           Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including    integrating the financial, technological and management    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses    with those of our existing operations;           Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms    acceptable to us;           U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting    our ability to make certain acquisitions;           Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of    acquired businesses;           Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and           Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity    and complexity of our operations.    11Table of Contents     The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and    may require additional financial resources and attention from    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing    development or expansion of our existing operations.

As a result of our    growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales    outside the United States will increase in the future.    International operations are subject to the customary risks of    operating in an international environment, including:           Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;           Overlap of different tax structures;           Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;           Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;           Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;           Restrictions on currency repatriation;           General economic conditions;           Unstable political situations;           Nationalization of assets; and           Compliance with a wide variety of international and    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Our    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by    compliance with export laws.     We are required to comply with various import, export, export    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the    export of certain products, services and technologies and in    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export    products and services and damage to our reputation.    12Table of ContentsAny    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to    compete successfully.     If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate    acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results    from those businesses, manage our expanding international    operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if    we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the    expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and    employees may adversely affect our results of operations. If we    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could    adversely affect our business and prospects.     We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our    ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.    Although we believe we have certain technological and other    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages    will require us to continue investing in research and    development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance    that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments,    that we will be able to make the technological advances    necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can    recover major research and development expenses. We are not    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which    could render our existing products obsolete, although there can    be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able    to develop and successfully market new products. A    shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could    increase our operating costs.     We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel    components, are available only from a limited number of    suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations.    Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could    affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our    competitive position, which could adversely affect our business,    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Certain    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs    associated with hazardous or toxic substance    clean-up    which may adversely affect our financial    condition.     Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a    number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous    materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental    Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint    and several liability for    clean-up    costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing    hazardous substances to sites designated for    clean-up    under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible    party at several sites, which are the subject of    government-mandated    clean-ups.    As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that    use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous    materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation,    removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to    compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to    precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending    environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we    believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have    a material adverse effect on our financial position or future    results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations,    new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement    of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously    unknown contamination or the imposition of new    clean-up    requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. There can be no assurance that future    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in    future liabilities.    13Table of ContentsWe are    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be    burdensome or lead to significant costs.     Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new    laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change,    may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our    products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or    regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and    regulations will have on our business or operations. We may    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.     We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for    instance, an aircraft component that has been designed,    manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant    liability if product liability lawsuits against us are    successful. While we believe our current general liability and    product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations. We    operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our    business.     Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and    internationally, with individual producers, as well as with    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of    competition for our products are price, product technology,    distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.    In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets    served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the    basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our    competitors may develop new or improve existing products that    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it    operates or that our products will be able to compete    successfully with those of our competitors. Our    access to sources of liquidity may be limited by market    conditions and restrictions in our revolving credit facility and    other agreements.     In 2009, the financial markets have experienced a significant    liquidity shortfall as a result of diverse conditions that have    caused the failure and near failure of a number of large    financial services companies. If the availability of funds    remains limited, we could incur increased costs associated with    renewal of our credit facility    and/or other    debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that our ability    to access the credit market may be limited by these or other    factors, at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which    could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions. Notwithstanding    the foregoing, at this time, we believe that available    short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to    fund our working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments,    interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan    contributions, income tax obligations, dividends to our    shareholders, any contemplated acquisitions and share    repurchases for the foreseeable future. We are    subject to possible insolvency of financial    counterparties.     We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts    including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit    facilities, financial derivatives and investment management    agreements involving various counterparties. We    14Table of Contents    are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties    may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its    obligations under such contracts. Our    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial    amount of our total assets and write-off of such substantial    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on    our financial condition and results of operations.     Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible    assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2009, goodwill    and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,    totaled $1,799.2 million or 55% of our total assets. The    goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess    of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other    identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum,    we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly    below current levels, we could reflect, under current applicable    accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for    goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination    requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or    other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial    condition and results of operations. "
9,AME,AMETEK INC,2009-02-26,">Item 1A.      Risk    Factors     You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all    other information contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect    our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial    condition. Current    economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could    adversely affect our results of operations and financial    condition.     The global economy is currently undergoing a period of    unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets, as    well as a general slowdown in demand, including in many of the    end markets we serve. A prolonged    11Table of Contents    period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect    on our results of operations and financial condition and    exacerbate the other risk factors we have described below. These    economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number    of ways. Our global business is adversely affected by decreases    in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in    business and consumer spending, capital spending, air travel,    industrial production and government procurement. Any economic    slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for    our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of    our customers to make timely payments. In addition, the    potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to    experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased.    Furthermore, a disparate impact on, or government actions    affecting, one of the major economies could produce volatility    in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain    major currencies, adversely affecting our results. We are unable    to predict the likely duration and severity of the current    disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions    in the U.S. and other countries. A    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely    affect our business.     Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in    nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control.    A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process    instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. Our    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be    able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate    recent and future acquisitions.     A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2004, through    December 31, 2008, we have completed 23 acquisitions. We    plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our    global market position and broaden our product offerings.    Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies    in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions    will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:           Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;           The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may    increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate    acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a    greater portion of the sellers liabilities;           Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including    integrating the financial, technological and management    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses    with those of our existing operations;           Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms    acceptable to us;           U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting    our ability to make certain acquisitions;           Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of    acquired businesses;           Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and           Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity    and complexity of our operations.     The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and    may require additional financial resources and attention from    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing    development or expansion of our existing operations.    Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired    business may not achieve the results we expected or produce    expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue    with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of    acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial    condition.    12Table of ContentsWe may    experience unanticipated    start-up    expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or    product line transfers.     Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently    relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.    Unanticipated    start-up    expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or    completing product line transfers, as well as possible    underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in    production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our    business and operations. Our    substantial international sales and operations are subject to    customary risks associated with international    operations.     International sales for 2008 and 2007 represented 48% and 49% of    our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our    growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales    outside the United States will increase in the future.    International operations are subject to the customary risks of    operating in an international environment, including:           Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;           Overlap of different tax structures;           Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;           Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;           Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;           Restrictions on currency repatriation;           General economic conditions;           Unstable political situations;           Nationalization of assets; and           Compliance with a wide variety of international and    U.S. laws and regulatory requirements. Our    international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by    compliance with export laws.     We are required to comply with various import, export, export    control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our    transactions with certain customers, business partners and other    persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our    employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export    control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the    export of certain products, services and technologies and in    other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export    license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure    to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil    and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions    to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export    products and services and damage to our reputation. Any    inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of    skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to    compete successfully.     If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of    qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate    acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results    from those businesses, manage our expanding international    operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if    we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the    expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and    employees may adversely affect our results of operations.    13Table of ContentsIf we    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could    adversely affect our business and prospects.     We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our    ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.

RISK FACTORS     You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information containedin this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business,results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate futureacquisitions, successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or finance future acquisitions.     A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Sincethe beginning of 2003, we have completed thirteen acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategicacquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although wehave been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfullyeffectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:  Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;   The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisitioncosts and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and mayresult in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;   Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial,technological and management processes, procedures and controls of the acquiredbusinesses with those of our existing operations;   Financing for acquisitions not being available on terms acceptable to us, or at all;   U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;   Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;   Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and   Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.     The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result inunforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention frommanagement that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of ourexisting operations. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successfulintegration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, liquidity and financial condition.10Table of ContentsWe may experience unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilitiesor product line transfers.          Certain of our businesses are relocating, or have recently relocated manufacturing operationsto low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening newfacilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of ourexisting facilities, could result in product inefficiencies, which would adversely affect ourbusiness and operations.Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated withinternational operations.     International sales for 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 48% and 46% of our total netsales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage ofsales outside the United States will continue to increase in the future. International operationsare subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:  Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;   Overlap of different tax structures;   Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;   Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relativevalue of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rateexposures;   Restrictions on currency repatriation;   General economic conditions;   Unstable political situations;   Nationalization of assets; and   Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. export laws and regulatory requirements.If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our businessand prospects.     We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop on a timelybasis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors,maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development andsales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make suchinvestments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain suchcompetitive advantages, or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are notcurrently aware of any emerging standards or new products, which could render our existing productsobsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able todevelop and successfully market new products.A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs.     We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are notdependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steelcomponents, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commoditymarket fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect theprices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affectour business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxicsubstance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.     Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local andforeign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, amongother things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling,storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks areinherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previousowner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing andremediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether11Table of Contentsthe owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardousmaterials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Actgenerally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, onparties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We havebeen named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject ofgovernment-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities thatuse, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incursubstantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related tocompliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potentialfinancial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe thatthe outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financialposition or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, newclassification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, thediscovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements couldrequire us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There canbe no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damagesdue to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significantcosts.     Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws andregulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and newlaws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. We cannot predict the impact anyof these will have on our business or operations.We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harmcaused by our products.     We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event thatthe use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example,our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of thefailure of, for example, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced byus. We may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful.While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate toprotect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claimsthat may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future atan acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-partyindemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operationsor ability to expand our business.     Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, withindividual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which haveresources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price,product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in specialty metalproducts stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although webelieve EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge,aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on thebasis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new, or improveexisting products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologiesor changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not beadversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that ourproducts will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motorbusinesses could adversely affect our business.     Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore areaffected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, processinstrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit ourability to incur additional indebtedness.     Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictivecovenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions couldlimit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.12Table of ContentsOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets andwrite-off of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on ourfinancial condition and results of operations.     Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31,2006, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1,081 million, or about 51% ofour total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of costover the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we haveacquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been an impairment in the value ofour intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units wereto fall significantly below current levels, we could reflect, under current applicable accountingrules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment.Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or otherintangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations"
12,AME,AMETEK INC,2006-03-06,">Item 1A.      Risk    Factors     You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all    other information contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial    condition. Our    growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be    able to consummate future acquisitions, to successfully    integrate recent and future acquisitions or to finance future    acquisitions.     A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of    strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2002, we have    completed nine acquisitions. We plan to continue making    strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and    broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful    with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to    effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of    factors, including:           Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;    10Table of Contents           Increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase    acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate    acquisitions on favorable terms;           Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including    integrating the financial, technological and management    processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses    with those of our existing operations;           Financing for acquisitions not being available on terms    acceptable to us, or at all;           U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our    ability to make certain acquisitions;           Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of    acquired businesses;           Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and           Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity    and complexity of our operations.     The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing    operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and    may require additional financial resources and attention from    management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing    development or expansion of our existing operations. Failure to    continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful    integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse    effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and    financial condition. We may    experience unanticipated    start-up    expenses and production delays in opening new    facilities.     Certain of our businesses are relocating, or have recently    relocated, manufacturing operations to low-cost locales.    Unanticipated    start-up    expenses and production delays in opening new facilities, as    well as possible underutilizations of our existing facilities,    could result in product inefficiencies, which would adversely    affect our business and operations. Our    substantial international sales and operations are subject to    customary risks associated with international    operations.     International sales for 2005 and 2004 represented approximately    46% and 44% of our total net sales, respectively. As a result of    our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales    outside the United States will continue to increase in the    future. International operations are subject to the customary    risks of operating in an international environment, including:           Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;           Overlap of different tax structures;           Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;           Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;           Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including    changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries    where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;           Restrictions on currency repatriation;           General economic conditions;           Unstable political situations; and           Compliance with a wide variety of international and    U.S. export laws and regulatory requirements. If we    are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could    adversely affect our business and prospects.     We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our    ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced    products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.    Although we believe we have certain technological and other    advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages    will require us to continue    11Table of Contents    investing in research and development and sales and marketing.    There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources    to make such investments, that we will be able to make the    technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive    advantages, or that we can recover major research and    development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging    standards or new products, which could render our existing    products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this    will not occur or that we will be able to develop and    successfully market new products. A    shortage or price increases in our raw materials could increase    our operating costs.     We have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material    requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier;    however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel    components, are available only from a limited number of    suppliers. Shortages in raw materials or price increases    therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs    and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our    business, results of operations, liquidity and financial    condition. Certain    environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs    associated with hazardous or toxic substance    clean-up    which may adversely affect our financial    condition.     Our business, operations and facilities are subject to a number    of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and    occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning,    among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the    use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage,    transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.    Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing    operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous    owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of    investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at    such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew    of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous    materials.

As the result of our ownership    and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle    and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur    substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and    capital expenditures in connection with compliance with    environmental laws. While it is not possible to quantify the    potential financial impact of pending environmental matters,    based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of    these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on    our financial position or future results of operations. In    addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously    unknown contamination or the imposition of new    clean-up    requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis    for new or increased liabilities that could have a material    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. There can be no assurance that future    environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental    damages due to prior or present practices will not result in    future liabilities. We are    subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be    burdensome or lead to significant costs.     Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and    foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing    laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new    laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us.    We cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our    business or operations. We may    be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with    alleged or actual harm caused by our products.     We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product    liability claims in the event that the use of our products is    alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For    example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for    personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an    aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or    serviced by us. We may incur significant liability if product    liability lawsuits against us    12Table of Contents    are successful. While we believe our current general liability    and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from    future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate    to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be    able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an    acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for    which third-party indemnification is not available could have a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations. We    operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely    affect our results of operations or ability to expand our    business.     Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and    internationally, with individual producers as well as with    vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have    resources greater than we do. The principal elements of    competition for our products are price, product technology,    distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in    specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and    processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG    is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify.

Our    competitors may develop new, or improve existing products that    are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new    technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There    can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it    operates or that our products will be able to compete    successfully with those of our competitors. A    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, heavy-vehicle,    process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could    adversely affect our business.     Several of the industries in which we operate may be cyclical in    nature and may be affected by factors beyond our control. A    prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, heavy-vehicle,    process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations. Restrictions    contained in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability    to incur additional indebtedness.     Our existing revolving credit facility contains restrictive    covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur    indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to    effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial    flexibility. Our    goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial    amount on our balance sheet and write-off of such substantial    goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on    our financial condition and results of operations.     Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets,    primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill and    other intangible assets totaled approximately $900 million,    or about 50% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our    acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair    value of the tangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum    annually, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the    value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance    at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly    below current levels, we could be required to record a non-cash    charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment, under    current applicable accounting rules. Any determination requiring    the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized other    intangible assets would negatively affect our financial    condition and results of operations. "
