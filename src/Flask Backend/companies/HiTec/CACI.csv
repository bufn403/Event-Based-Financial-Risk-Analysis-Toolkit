You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns including global pandemics like COVID-19, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions, that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impact our business operations and liquidity. Risks Related to our Business and IndustryWe generate substantially all of our revenues from contracts with the federal government. If the federal government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenues from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 94.8% and 94.8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Specifically, we generated 71.9% and 69.8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies was impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work. The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in spending levels or budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenues from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities, such as for homeland security or to address global pandemics like COVID-19, or actions taken to address government budget deficits, the national debt, and/or prevailing economic conditions, could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. For further discussion, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.8At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own internal funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for Expertise or Technology. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We generate substantially all of our revenues from federal government contracts that typically include a base period and discrete option periods. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;•claim rights in systems and software developed by us;•suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;•impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and•control or prohibit the export of our data and technology. If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We derive significant revenues from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenues under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.9This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:•we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;•we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;•we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and•we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not generate the revenues anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.10Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenues from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenues, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.Federal government agencies, including the DCAA and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenues in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenues.We derive substantial revenues from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenues and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenues in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents contract value for which funding has been appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Unfunded backlog represents estimated values that have the potential to be recognized into revenue from executed contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised contract options. Our backlog may not result in actual revenues in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract. For example, we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also generate revenues from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods in which Congress appropriates funds on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their full performance period and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, our backlog may not result in revenues or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenues that we have the potential to realize. If our backlog estimate is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenues, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 11Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include timecard fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenues may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenues and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. An increase in the prices of goods and services could raise the costs associated with providing our services, diminish our ability to compete for new contracts or task orders and/or reduce customer buying power.We may experience an increase in the costs in our supply and labor markets due to global inflationary pressures and other various geopolitical factors. We generate a portion of our revenues through various fixed-price and multi-year government contracts which anticipate moderate increases in costs over the term of the contract. With the current pace of inflation our standard approach to moderate annual price escalations in our bids for multi-year work may be insufficient to counter inflationary cost pressures. This could result in reduced profits, or even losses, as inflation increases, particularly for fixed-priced contracts and our longer-term multi-year contracts. In the competitive environment in which we operate as a government contractor, the lack of pricing leverage and ability to renegotiate long-term, multi-year contracts, could reduce our profits, disrupt our business, or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations.12We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We generated 30.2% and 29.4% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2023, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may therefore vary materially and adversely depending on the relative mix of contract types, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Risks Related to our AcquisitionsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at a slower rate than we historically have grown.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as we historically have grown, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:•increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;•our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from what we anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenues or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.As of June 30, 2023, goodwill accounts for $4.1 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. 13Risks Related to our IndebtednessOur senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, and include the following:•incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;•paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;•making certain investments, loans and advances;•exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;•issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;•transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;•amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and•engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any covenants in the Credit Facility would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,975.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $1,225.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit. At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $500.0 million and 75% of the Company’s EBITDA plus an unlimited amount of indebtedness subject to 3.75 times, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals. As of June 30, 2023, $525.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $1,179.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on December 13, 2026. Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events will constitute a default.Risks Related to our OperationsWe must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:•allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;•require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction;•require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and•require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.14Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our operating results.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenues or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenues, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties. Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the U.K. and the Netherlands. As a percentage of our total revenues, our international operations generated 2.8% and 3.1% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes. 15The effects of health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts to control its spread have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies, leading to disruptions and volatility in global capital markets. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows as the result of significant portions of our workforce being unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, vaccination status, or other restrictions; the inability for us to fully perform on our contracts as a result of government actions or reduction in personnel due to the federal vaccine mandate which requires all federal contractors to be vaccinated; delays or limits to the ability of the U.S. Government or other customers to make timely payments; incurrence of increased costs which may not be recoverable; adverse impacts on our access to capital; or other unpredictable events. We continue to monitor the effect of COVID-19 on our business, but we cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 as the extent of the impact will depend on the duration and spread of the pandemic and the actions taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19"
10,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2022-08-11,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns including global pandemics like COVID-19, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions, that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impact our business operations and liquidity.  Risks Related to our Business and IndustryWe generate substantially all of our revenues from contracts with the federal government.  If the federal government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenues from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 94.8% and 95.5% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Specifically, we generated 69.8% and 69.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies was impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.8 Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in spending levels or budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenues from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities, such as for homeland security or to address global pandemics like COVID-19, or actions taken to address government budget deficits, the national debt, and/or prevailing economic conditions, could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.  For further discussion, refer to “Business Environment and Industry Trends” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own internal funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for expertise or technology. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We generate substantially all of our revenues from federal government contracts that typically include a base period and discrete option periods. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;•claim rights in systems and software developed by us;•suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;•impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and•control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.9 If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenues from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenues under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:•we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;•we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;•we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and•we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not generate the revenues anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  10 A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenues from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenues, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.Federal government agencies, including the DCAA and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenues in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenues.We derive substantial revenues from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenues and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.11 We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenues in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents contract value for which funding has been appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Unfunded backlog represents estimated values that have the potential to be recognized into revenue from executed contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised contract options. Our backlog may not result in actual revenues in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract. For example, we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also generate revenues from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods in which Congress appropriates funds on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their full performance period and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, our backlog may not result in revenues or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenues that we have the potential to realize.  If our backlog estimate is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenues, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include timecard fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.12 Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenues may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenues and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  An increase in the prices of goods and services could raise the costs associated with providing our services, diminish our ability to compete for new contracts or task orders and/or reduce customer buying power.We may experience an increase in the costs in our supply and labor markets due to global inflationary pressures and other various geopolitical factors. We generate a portion of our revenues through various fixed price and multi-year government contracts which anticipate moderate increases in costs over the term of the contract. With the current pace of inflation our standard approach to moderate annual price escalations in our bids for multi-year work may be insufficient to counter inflationary cost pressures. This could result in reduced profits, or even losses, as inflation increases, particularly for fixed priced contracts and our longer-term multi-year contracts. In the competitive environment in which we operate as a government contractor, the lack of pricing leverage and ability to renegotiate long-term, multi-year contracts, could reduce our profits, disrupt our business, or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We generated 29.4% and 29.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2022, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may therefore vary materially and adversely depending on the relative mix of contract types, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.13 Risks Related to our AcquisitionsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at a slower rate than we historically have grown.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as we historically have grown, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:•increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;•our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and•acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from what we anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenues or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.As of June 30, 2022, goodwill accounts for $4.1 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Risks Related to our IndebtednessOur senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, and include the following:•incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;•paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;•making certain investments, loans and advances;•exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;•issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;•transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;14  •amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and•engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any covenants in the Credit Facility would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,975.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $1,225.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $500.0 million and 75% of the Company’s EBITDA plus an unlimited amount of indebtedness subject to 3.75 times, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  As of June 30, 2022, $533.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $1,209.7 million was outstanding under the Term Loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on December 13, 2026.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events will constitute a default.Risks Related to our OperationsWe must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:•allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;•require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction;•require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and•require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our operating results.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.15 The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenues or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenues, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As a percentage of our total revenues, our international operations generated 3.1% and 2.9% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  16 The effects of health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts to control its spread have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies, leading to disruptions and volatility in global capital markets. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows as the result of significant portions of our workforce being unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, vaccination status, or other restrictions; the inability for us to fully perform on our contracts as a result of government actions or reduction in personnel due to the federal vaccine mandate which requires all federal contractors to be vaccinated; delays or limits to the ability of the U.S. Government or other customers to make timely payments; incurrence of increased costs which may not be recoverable; adverse impacts on our access to capital; or other unpredictable events. We continue to monitor the effect of COVID-19 on our business, but we cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 as the extent of the impact will depend on the duration and spread of the pandemic and the actions taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19"
16,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2021-08-17,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns including global pandemics like COVID-19, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions, that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impact our business operations and liquidity.  Risks Related to our Business and IndustryWe generate substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government.  If the federal government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 95.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2021 and 95.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2020. Specifically, we generated 69.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2021 and 69.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2020 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies was impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in spending levels or budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities, such as for homeland security or to address global pandemics like COVID-19, or actions taken to address government budget deficits, the national debt, and/or prevailing economic conditions, could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.  For further discussion, refer to “Business Environment and Industry Trends” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations” in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own internal funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.9Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We generate substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically include a base period and discrete option periods. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: •cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; •claim rights in systems and software developed by us; •suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; •impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and •control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  10We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: •we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; •we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; •we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and •we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not generate the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.11The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.Federal government agencies, including the DCAA and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.12We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents contract value that has been appropriated by a customer and is expected to be recognized into revenue. Unfunded backlog represents the sum of the unappropriated contract value on executed contracts and unexercised option years that is expected to be recognized into revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also generate revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods in which Congress appropriates funds on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their full performance period and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, our backlog may not result in revenue or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue that we have the potential to realize.  If our backlog estimate is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.13Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We generated 29.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2021 and 28.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2020 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2021, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may therefore vary materially and adversely depending on the relative mix of contract types, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.14 Risks Related to our AcquisitionsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than we historically have grown.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as we historically have grown, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: •increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; •our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and •acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from what we anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $3.6 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Risks Related to our IndebtednessOur senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, and include the following: •incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; •paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; •making certain investments, loans and advances; •exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; •issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; •transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;15  •amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and •engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any covenants in the Credit Facility would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,500.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $938.4 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $500.0 million or an amount subject to 3.50 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2021, $945.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $797.6 million was outstanding under the Term Loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2024.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events will constitute a default.Risks Related to our OperationsWe must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: •allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; •require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; •require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and •require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.16Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our operating results.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.17We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As a percentage of our total revenue, our international operations generated 2.9 percent and 2.9 percent in FY2021 and FY2020, respectively. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  The effects of health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts to control its spread have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies, leading to disruptions and volatility in global capital markets. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows as the result of significant portions of our workforce being unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions; the inability for us to fully perform on our contracts; delays or limits to the ability of the U.S. Government or other customers to make timely payments; incurrence of increased costs which may not be recoverable; adverse impacts on our access to capital; or other unpredictable events. We continue to monitor the effect of COVID-19 on our business, but we cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 as the extent of the impact will depend on the duration and spread of the pandemic and the actions taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19"
12,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2020-08-14,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns including global pandemics like COVID-19, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions, that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impact our business operations and liquidity.  We generate substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government.  If the federal government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 95.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2020 and 95.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2019. Specifically, we generated 69.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2020 and 70.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2019 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies was impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in spending levels or budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities, such as for homeland security or to address global pandemics like COVID-19, or actions taken to address government budget deficits, the national debt, and/or prevailing economic conditions, could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.  For further discussion, refer to “Business Environment and Industry Trends” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations” in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.8At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own internal funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We generate substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically include a base period and discrete option periods. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: •cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; •claim rights in systems and software developed by us; •suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; •impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and •control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  9We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: •we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; •we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; •we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and •we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not generate the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: •allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; •require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; •require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and •require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.10Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents contract value that has been appropriated by a customer and is expected to be recognized into revenue. Unfunded backlog represents the sum of the unappropriated contract value on executed contracts and unexercised option years that is expected to be recognized into revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.11The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also generate revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods in which Congress appropriates funds on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their full performance period and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, our backlog may not result in revenue or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue that we have the potential to realize.  If our backlog estimate is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.12Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We generated 28.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2020 and 29.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2019 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2020, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may therefore vary materially and adversely depending on the relative mix of contract types, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our operating results.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  13Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: •increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; •our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and •acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.14The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $3.4 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As a percentage of our total revenue, our international operations generated 2.9 percent and 3.1 percent in FY2020 and FY2019, respectively. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  15Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: •incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; •paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; •making certain investments, loans and advances; •exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; •issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; •transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions; •amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and •engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,500.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $938.4 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $500.0 million or an amount subject to 3.50 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2020, $569.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $844.6 million was outstanding under the Term Loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2024.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events will constitute a default.16The effects of health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts to control its spread have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies, leading to disruptions and volatility in global capital markets. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows as the result of significant portions of our workforce being unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions; the inability for us to fully perform on our contracts; delays or limits to the ability of the U.S. Government or other customers to make timely payments; incurrence of increased costs which may not be recoverable; adverse impacts on our access to capital; or other unpredictable events. We continue to monitor the effect of COVID-19 on our business, but we cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 as the extent of the impact will depend on the duration and spread of the pandemic and the actions taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19"
1,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2019-08-21,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions, that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impact our business operations and liquidity.  We generate substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government.  If the federal government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 95.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2019 and 94.8 percent of our total revenue in FY2018. Specifically, we generated 70.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2019 and 67.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2018 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies was impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.  Refer to the “Budgetary Environment” section within “Industry Trends” above for further discussion.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our own internal funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We generate substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically include a base period and discrete option periods. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.12Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: ●cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; ●claim rights in systems and software developed by us; ●suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; ●impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and ●control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.13This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: ●we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; ●we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; ●we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and ●we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not generate the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: ●allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; ●require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; ●require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and ●require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.14Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents contract value that has been appropriated by a customer and is expected to be recognized into revenue. Unfunded backlog represents the sum of the unappropriated contract value on executed contracts and unexercised option years that is expected to be recognized into revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also generate revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods in which Congress appropriates funds on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their full performance period and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, our backlog may not result in revenue or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue that we have the potential to realize.  If our backlog estimate is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  15Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  16We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We generated 29.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2019 and 32.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2018 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2019, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may therefore vary materially and adversely depending on the relative mix of contract types, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.17We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: ●increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; ●our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and ●acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.18The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $3.3 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As a percentage of our total revenue, our international operations generated 3.1 percent and 3.7 percent in FY2019 and FY2018, respectively. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  19Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial covenants. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: ●incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; ●paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; ●making certain investments, loans and advances; ●exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; ●issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; ●transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions; ●amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and ●engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,500.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $938.4 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $500.0 million or an amount subject to 3.50 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2019, $785.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $891.5 million was outstanding under the term loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2024.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events will constitute a default"
15,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2018-08-20,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.  We depend on contracts with the federal government for substantially all of our revenue.  If the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 93.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2018 and 93.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2017. Specifically, we generated 66.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2018 and 65.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2017 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.12 Subsequent to the enactment of the BCA in 2011, the Congress and the Administration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation.  The BCA required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the government’s FY2012 through FY2021.  It also included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion over nine years starting in the government’s FY2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion.  The effects of sequestration on spending discretionary and non-exempt mandatory have been mitigated by three pieces of legislation:  BBA 2013, signed into law in late December of 2013, revising the amount of discretionary spending to be reduced for the government’s FY2014 and FY2015, as originally allowed under the BCA; as part of an act to exempt from the BCA the retirement pay of members and former members of the Armed Forces under the age of 62 before the start of 2014; and by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015), signed into law at the end of October 2015, increasing the defense and non-defense FY2016 and FY2017 discretionary spending caps.  These laws extended the automatic direct spending reductions to the government’s FY2025.  In February 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018) was signed into law.  This law established a framework and increased the caps on defense and non-defense discretionary spending for the government’s FY2018 and FY2019.  If there are no changes to at least the discretionary spending levels set by the BCA for the government’s FY2020, full sequestration of defense and non-defense spending will return on October 1, 2019.In light of the BCA and deficit reduction pressures offset by the BBA 2018, discretionary spending by the federal government is expected to be higher in the government’s FY2018 and FY2019, and constrained thereafter at least through the government’s FY2021.  The sequester mechanism, if left unmodified beyond the government’s FY2019, along with other pressures on government spending, could negatively impact our business and could have further negative impacts on us in the future.  We may experience disruption of existing programs, delays in contract awards, and other actions, including partial or complete contract terminations.In years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies.  Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018 and extended through the entire government 2019 fiscal year, it could have significant consequences to our business and our industry.  If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September, a shutdown of the federal government will result on October 1, 2018, as happened in October 2013 and again, briefly, in January 2018.  Were a shutdown to occur, it could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts or the delaying or cancelling of certain programs.  This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: ●cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; ●claim rights in systems and software developed by us;13  ●suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; ●impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and ●control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: ●we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; ●we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; ●we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and ●we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.14 If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: ●allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; ●require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; ●require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and ●require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.15 Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of the contracts. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Although many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their term and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, the receipt of revenues included in our backlog may never occur or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue we have the potential to realize.  On unfunded contract work, including amounts based on the assumed exercise of options under such contracts. If our backlog is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  16 Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  17 We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 32.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2018 and 32.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2017 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2018, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.18 In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: ●increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; ●our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and ●acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.19 The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $2.6 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 3.7 percent of our revenue in FY2018 and 3.1 percent of our revenue in FY2017. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  20 In May 2018, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) came into force in the U.K. This new legislation imposes more stringent data protection obligations on companies such as CACI that process personal data. The maximum fine which can be levied by the U.K. data protection regulator has increased to 4.0 percent of revenue. CACI has been preparing for this legislation since mid-2017 and has implemented a number of risk-mitigating strategies, however, it is not possible to eliminate all risk associated with the new legislation. Possible risks include violations of the DPA and/or GDPR arising from human error or external threats to CACI’s IT systems or process omissions.Approximately 74.0 percent of the revenue generated by our international operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to customers in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: ●incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; ●paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; ●making certain investments, loans and advances; ●exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; ●issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; ●transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions; ●amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and ●engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of a $1,100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $938.4 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has sub-facilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $400.0 million or an amount subject to 2.75 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2018, $135.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $938.4 million was outstanding under the term loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2023.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.21 A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default"

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.  We depend on contracts with the federal government for substantially all of our revenue.  If the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 93.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2017 and 93.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2016. Specifically, we generated 65.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2017 and 65.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2016 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.Subsequent to the enactment of the BCA in 2011, the Congress and the Administration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation.  The BCA required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the government’s fiscal year 2012 through 2021.  It also included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion over nine years starting in the government’s fiscal year 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion.  The effects of sequestration on spending discretionary and non-exempt mandatory have been mitigated by three pieces of legislation:  BBA 2013, signed into law in late December of 2013, revising the amount of discretionary spending to be reduced for the government’s fiscal years 2014 and 2015, as originally allowed under the BCA; as part of an act to exempt from the BCA the retirement pay of members and former members of the Armed Forces under the age of 62 before the start of 2014; and by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015), signed into law at the end of October 2015, increasing the defense and non-defense FY2016 and FY2017 discretionary spending caps.  These laws extended the automatic direct spending reductions to the government’s FY2025.  If there are no changes to at least the discretionary spending levels set by the BCA for the government’s FY2018, full sequestration of defense and non-defense spending will return on October 1, 2017.In light of the BCA and deficit reduction pressures, discretionary spending by the federal government continues to be constrained and is expected to be so at least through the government’s FY2021.  The sequester mechanism, if left unmodified beyond the government’s fiscal year 2017, along with other pressures on government spending, could negatively impact our business and could have further negative impacts on us in the future.  We may experience disruption of existing programs, delays in contract awards, and other actions, including partial or complete contract terminations.12 In years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies.  Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2017 and extended through the entire government 2018 fiscal year, and sequestration continues as part of the implementation of the BCA, it could have significant consequences to our business and our industry.  If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September, a shutdown of the federal government will result on October 1, 2017, as happened in October 2013.  Were a shutdown to occur, it could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts or the delaying or cancelling of certain programs.  This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: ●cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; ●claim rights in systems and software developed by us; ●suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; ●impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and ●control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.13 If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: ●we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; ●we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; ●we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and ●we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  14 We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: ●allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; ●require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; ●require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and ●require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information, covered defense information, and controlled unclassified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on the majority of work performed after June 30, 2009 have not yet been completed. We have received notifications from DCAA on some smaller portions of our business they consider to be low risk, which will likely result in our proposed rates for those portions for periods subsequent to June 30, 2009 being accepted without adjustments.  In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed.  We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. 15 Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of the contracts. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Although many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts on an annual basis. As a result, a majority of our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their term and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, the receipt of revenues included in our backlog may never occur or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue we have the potential to realize.  On unfunded contract work, including amounts based on the assumed exercise of options under such contracts. If our backlog is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.16 Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 32.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2017 and 33.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2016 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.17 When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2017, our backlog included cost reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will reduce such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.18 We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: ●increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; ●our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and ●acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.19 The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $2.6 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (e.g., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (e.g., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 3.1 percent of our revenue in FY2017 and 4.0 percent of our revenue in FY2016. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  20 Approximately 68.0 percent of the revenue generated by our international operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to customers in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: ●incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; ●paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; ●making certain investments, loans and advances; ●exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; ●issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; ●transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions; ●amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and ●engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of an $850.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $1,131.3 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has subfacilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  The Credit Facility was amended during the third quarter of FY2016 in connection with the Company’s acquisition of NSS (see Note 4).  CACI financed the transaction by borrowing $250.0 million under its existing Revolving Facility and by entering into an eighth amendment and first incremental facility amendment to its Credit Facility to allow for the incurrence of $300.0 million in additional Term Loans.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $400.0 million or an amount subject to 2.75 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2017, $265.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $978.9 million was outstanding under the term loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 1, 2020.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default.21 "
2,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2016-08-24,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.  We depend on contracts with the federal government for substantially all of our revenue.  If the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 93.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2016 and 93.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2015. Specifically, we generated 65.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2016 and 66.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2015 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.12 Subsequent to the enactment of the BCA in 2011, the Congress and the Administration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation.  The BCA required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the government’s fiscal year 2012 through 2021.  It also included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion over nine years starting in the government’s fiscal year 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion.  The effects of sequestration have been mitigated by two pieces of legislation:  the BBA of 2013, signed into law in late December of 2013, revising the amount of discretionary spending to be reduced for the government’s fiscal years 2014 and 2015 as originally allowed under the BCA followed by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015), signed into law at the end of October 2015, increasing the defense and non-defense FY2016 and FY2017 discretionary spending caps.  This law further extended the automatic direct spending reductions to the government’s FY2025.  If there are no changes to at least the discretionary spending levels set by the BCA for the government’s FY2018, full sequestration of defense and non-defense spending will return on October 1, 2017.In light of the BCA, the provisions of the BBA 2015, and deficit reduction pressures, discretionary spending by the federal government continues to be constrained and is expected to be so at least through the government’s FY2025.  The sequester mechanism, if left unmodified beyond the government’s fiscal year 2017, along with other pressures on government spending, could negatively impact our business and could have further negative impacts on us in the future.  We may experience disruption of existing programs, delays in contract awards, and other actions, including partial or complete contract terminations.In years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies.  Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2016 and extended through the entire government 2017 fiscal year, and sequestration continues as part of the implementation of the BCA, it could have significant consequences to our business and our industry.  If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September, a shutdown of the federal government will result on October 1, 2016, as happened in October 2013.  Were a shutdown to occur, it could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts or the delaying or cancelling of certain programs.  This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to: ●cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable; ●claim rights in systems and software developed by us; ●suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; ●impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and ●control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  13 If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: ●we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; ●we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win; ●we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and ●we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.14 Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that: ●allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence; ●require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction; ●require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and ●require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including 15 termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on the majority of work performed after June 30, 2009 have not yet been completed. We have received notifications from DCAA on some smaller portions of our business they consider to be low risk, which will likely result in our proposed rates for those portions for periods subsequent to June 30, 2009 being accepted without adjustments.  In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed.  We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of the contracts. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Although many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts on an annual basis. As a result, a majority our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their term and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, the receipt of revenues included in our backlog may never occur or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on the aggregate contract revenue we have the potential to realize.  On unfunded contract work, including amounts based on the assumed exercise of options under such contracts. If our backlog is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.16 Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 33.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2016 and 35.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2015 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.17 When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2016, our backlog included cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will avoid such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.18 We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including: ●increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions; ●our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and ●acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.19 The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $2.6 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 4.0 percent of our revenue in FY2016 and 4.4 percent of our revenue in FY2015. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.  These risks are increased by the uncertainty caused by the U.K. vote to leave the European Union (Brexit).20 Approximately 73.0 percent of the revenue generated by our international operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to customers in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: ●incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt; ●paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits; ●making certain investments, loans and advances; ●exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets; ●issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries; ●transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions; ●amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and ●engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of an $850.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $1,131.3 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has subfacilities of $100.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  The Credit Facility was amended during the third quarter of FY2016 in connection with the Company’s acquisition of NSS (see Note 4).  CACI financed the transaction by borrowing $250.0 million under its existing Revolving Facility and by entering into an eighth amendment and first incremental facility amendment to its Credit Facility to allow for the incurrence of $300.0 million in additional Term Loans.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $400.0 million or an amount subject to 2.75 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2016, $440.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $1,032.8 million was outstanding under the term loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 1, 2020.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default.21 "
3,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2015-08-21,"Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.  We depend on contracts with the federal government for substantially all of our revenue.  If the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.The federal government is our primary customer, with revenue from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for 93.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2015 and 94.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2014. Specifically, we generated 66.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2015 and 72.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2014 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.  The number of bid protests of contract awards by unsuccessful bidders is increasing and the U.S. government is taking longer to resolve such protests. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.Because we derive a substantially all of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.Subsequent to the enactment of the BCA in 2011, the Congress and the Administration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation.  The BCA required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the government’s fiscal year 2012 through 2021.  It also included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion over nine years starting in the government’s fiscal year 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion.  In March 2013, as required by the BCA, the President ordered sequestration into effect which triggered automatic reductions in both defense and domestic discretionary spending for the government’s fiscal year 2013. Sequestration continued into the government’s fiscal year 2015; however, the BBA of 2013, signed into law in late December of 2013, revised the amount of discretionary spending to be reduced for the government’s fiscal years 2014 and 2015 as originally allowed under the BCA.  During the government’s fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts continued to have significant consequences to our business and industry.  If there are no changes to at least the discretionary spending levels originally set by the BCA for the government’s FY16, full sequestration will return on October 1, 2015.12 In years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies.  Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2015 and extended through the entire government 2016 fiscal year, and sequestration continues as part of the implementation of the BCA, it could have significant consequences to our business and our industry.  If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September, a shutdown of the federal government will result on October 1, 2015, as happened in October 2013.  Were a shutdown to occur, it could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts or the delaying or cancelling of certain programs.  This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds in order to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs’ funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.Additionally, our business could be affected if the demand for and priority of funding for the current level of operations in Afghanistan decreases faster than we have anticipated or if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contract’s potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:●cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;●claim rights in systems and software developed by us;●suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;●impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and●control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.  If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.13 If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.Our contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal government’s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:●we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;●we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;●we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and●we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our customers.Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing customers could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  14 We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:●allow our federal government customers to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;●require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the government’s satisfaction;●require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and●require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.  These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Restrictions on or other changes to the federal government’s use of service contracts may harm our operating results.We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the government’s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on the majority of work performed after June 30, 2008 have not yet been completed. We have received notifications from DCAA on some smaller portions of our business they consider to be low risk, which will likely result in our proposed rates for those portions for periods subsequent to June 30, 2008 being accepted without adjustments.  In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed.  We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. 15 Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the customer services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon management’s estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.Although many of our federal government contracts include multi-year performance periods, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts on an annual basis. As a result, a majority our contracts are only partially funded at any point during their term and unfunded contract work is subject to future appropriations by Congress. As a result of a lack of appropriated funds or efforts to reduce federal government spending, the receipt of revenues included in our backlog may never occur or may be delayed. We calculate our unfunded backlog based on management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work, including amounts based on the assumed exercise of options under such contracts. If our estimated backlog is inaccurate and we fail to realize those amounts as revenue, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of customers and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.16 Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our customers effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers’ needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and customer preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal government’s budgeting process and policy priorities.Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 35.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2015 and 30.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2014 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.17 When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government customers. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At June 30, 2015, our backlog included cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our customers. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions.  Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will avoid such impact in the future.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The systems and networks that we maintain for our customers, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.Many of the systems that we develop, integrate, maintain, otherwise support or use involve managing and protecting intelligence, national security, and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to protect such information and comply with all relevant privacy and security requirements, the threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated. A security breach or system failure in a system that we develop, integrate, maintain or otherwise support could result in a loss of revenue, remediation costs, claims for damages or contract termination and our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur. Any such event could also cause serious damage to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such sensitive systems for U.S. government customers.In addition, in order to provide services to our customers, we often depend upon or use customer systems that are supported by the customer or third parties.  Any security breach or system failure in such systems could result in an interruption of our customer’s operations, significant delays under a contract, and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.18 We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government customers, increased the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepened our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:●increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;●our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and●acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.  A subcontractor’s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.19 The federal government’s appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other customers or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner.  Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely.  The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill accounts for $2.2 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.  Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 4.4 percent of our revenue in FY2015 and 4.0 percent of our revenue in FY2014. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.20 Approximately 74.0 percent of the revenue generated by our international operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to customers in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:●incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;●paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;●making certain investments, loans and advances;●exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;●issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;●transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;●amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and●engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.The Credit Facility consists of an $850.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and an $831.3 million term loan facility (the Term Loan).  The Revolving Facility has subfacilities of $75.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit.  At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has the right to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $400.0 million or an amount subject to 2.75 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn, with applicable lender approvals.  At June 30, 2015, $295.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $779.3 million was outstanding under the term loan.  In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.The Credit Facility matures on June 1, 2020.  Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default"
14,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2014-08-28,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
    You should carefullyconsider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we haveidentified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditionsincluding a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions ofexpected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government fora substantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.   We derived 94.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2014 and94.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 72.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2014 and 74.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 from contractswith agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, theGeneral Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us orsignificantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   Our business could be adversely affected by delayscaused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.    It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in thestartup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   13 Table of ContentsOur business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of thefederal government.    Because we derive asubstantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes infederal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contractingpolicies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.   Subsequent to the enactment of the Budget Act of 2011, theCongress and the Administration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation. The Budget Act required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the governments fiscal year 2012through 2021. It also included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion over nine years starting in the governments fiscal year 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2trillion. In March 2013, as required by the Budget Act, the President ordered sequestration into effect which triggered automatic reductions in both defense and domestic discretionary spending for the governments fiscal year 2013.Sequestration continued into the governments fiscal year 2014; however, the BBA of 2013, signed into law in late December of 2013, revised the amount of discretionary spending to be reduced for the governments fiscal years 2014 and 2015as originally allowed under the Budget Act. Even with the reduced amount of sequestration for the governments fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts are having and may continue to have significantconsequences to our business and industry.    Inyears when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a CR that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at thelevels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had amaterial effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2014 and extended through the entire government 2015 fiscal year, andsequestration continues as part of the implementation of the Budget Act, it could have significant consequences to our business and our industry. If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September, ashutdown of the federal government will result on October 1, 2014, as happened in October 2013. Were a shutdown to occur, it could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts or thedelaying or cancelling of certain programs. This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.   At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds in order to meet our customers desired delivery dates forproducts or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternativefunding cuts.    Additionally, our business could beseriously affected if the demand for and priority of funding for combat operations in Afghanistan decreases faster than we have anticipated or if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses which could result in our inability tocompete directly for prime contracts.    Ourfederal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results maydiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half ofthe contracts   14 Table of Contentspotential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a governmentclient to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.   Federal government contracts contain numerousprovisions that are unfavorable to us.   Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, someof which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;     claim rights in systems and software developed by us;     suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;     impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.   If the government terminates a contract for convenience, wemay recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts and instead may beliable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable orpotentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work onthe design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a programor contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain ofour contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If we fail to establish and maintain importantrelationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.   To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officialsof various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationshipswith government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   15 Table of ContentsWe derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through acompetitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.   Our contracts and task orders with the federal governmentare typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurementprocess have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiplecontractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under suchcontracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of suchprograms may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice ofmaintaining a diverse contracting base.    Thiscompetitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:      we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest orchallenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.   If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may beprevented from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected andthat could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently acompetitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significantcontracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.   Many of our federal government contracts require us to havesecurity clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees loseor are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the requiredsecurity clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   16 Table of ContentsWe must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply couldcause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.    We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costson our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:      allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss ofsecurity clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    The federal government maychange its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.    The federal government may change its procurement practices, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as those related to cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methodsrelating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there isuncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contractingmethods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Restrictions on or other changes to the federalgovernments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.    We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on thenature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwiseadversely affect our results of operations.    Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and governmentcontractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internalcontrols over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a   17 Table of Contentsspecific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systemsare found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner.Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, wemay be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. Inaddition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred onwork performed after June 30, 2007 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of anyexisting or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.  Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.   We may not receive the full amounts authorized underthe contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.   Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, andunfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or atall, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenuethat we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract.We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of thegovernment to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which couldsignificantly harm our prospects.   Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for thesecontracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequentCongressional appropriations and the obligation of   18 Table of Contentsadditional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to thesecontracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Employee misconduct, includingsecurity breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.   We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect ourbusiness and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs ingovernment contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access tosuch critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could faceunknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.   Our continued success depends to asubstantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon theexpertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience highattrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantialresources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and causeour actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate newbusiness and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in ourindustry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Ourmarkets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.   The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may competemore effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable todifferentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, newcompetitors or   19 Table of Contentsalliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companieswhich are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results could bevolatile due to the unpredictability of the federal governments budgeting process and policy priorities.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federalgovernment does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-oncontracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore,period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.   Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverseeffect on the market price of our common stock.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which isconducted on a fixed-price basis.    Weperform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 30.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2014 and 28.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require usto price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability toincrease prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates,our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capabilityto complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts lessprofitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. On rare occasions, these losses have beensignificant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.   At June 30, 2014, our backlog included costreimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-termgovernment contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, isfinally determined.   20 Table of ContentsSystems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations.    Any systems failures,including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data orinterruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure,including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe thatour continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will avoid such impact in the future. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Inaddition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate usfor all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, couldalso fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate tocompensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipatedrates.    One of our key growth strategieshas been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We mayencounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operatingour core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisitionstrategy, including:      increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses ortheir employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or othercustomers; and      acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We may have difficultyintegrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquirein the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for theongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new   21 Table of Contentsinformation systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or otherreasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted andour actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. Afailure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform ourobligations as a prime contractor.    Asubcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverseeffect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal governments appropriationprocess and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.   We depend on the collection of our receivables to generatecash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstandinginvoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget.In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can alsoadversely affect our ability to collect timely. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one ormore of a contractors business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not bepaid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes infuture business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.   Goodwill accounts for $2.2 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually orwhen evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairmentof recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.   22 Table of ContentsOur operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to ouremployees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.   Our federal business includes themaintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval orunrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs forreasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who areinjured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, ourinsurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.   Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protectour proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may beunable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietaryinformation, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of our international operations inthe United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 4.0 percent of our revenue in FY2014 and 3.7 percent of our revenue in FY2013. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreigncountry. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.   Approximately 74.5 percent of the revenue generated by ourinternational operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on the telecommunications, computer softwareand computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us and our efforts in thatregard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes inforeign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   23 Table of ContentsOur senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictionson our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.   The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. Theserestrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;     paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;     exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;     amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and     engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.   The failure to comply with any of these covenants would causea default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financingis available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.    Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The Credit Facility consists of an $850.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and an $831.3 million term loanfacility (the Term Loan). The Revolving Facility has subfacilities of $50.0 million for same-day swing line loan borrowings and $25.0 million for stand-by letters of credit. At any time and so long as no default has occurred, the Company has theright to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $400.0 million or an amount subject to 2.75 times senior secured leverage, calculated assuming the revolving Facility is fully drawn,with applicable lender approvals. At June 30, 2014, $475.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $810.5 million was outstanding under the term loan. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incuradditional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   Servicing our debt requires a significantamount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.   The Credit Facility matures on November 15, 2018. Principal payments under the term loan are due in quarterly installments. Ourbusiness may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.   A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.    The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute adefault.   24 Table of Contents"
13,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2013-08-27,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
    You should carefullyconsider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we haveidentified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditionsincluding a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions ofexpected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government fora substantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.   We derived 94.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 and94.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2012 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 74.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 and 78.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2012 from contractswith agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, theGeneral Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us orsignificantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   Our business could be adversely affected by delayscaused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.    It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in thestartup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.   Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue fromcontracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary prioritiescould directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal governmentagencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.   13 Table of ContentsSubsequent to the enactment of the Budget Act in August of 2011, the Congress and theAdministration were unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the legislation. On March 1, 2013, as required by the Budget Act, the President ordered sequestration into effect, triggering automatic reductions totaling$85 billion in both defense and domestic discretionary spending through September 30, 2013. On April 10, 2013, also under the terms of the Budget Act, the President signed a sequestration order which directs that total discretionaryspending for the governments fiscal year 2014, starting October 1, 2013, be reduced by $91 billion. The Budget Act required total projected defense spending to decline by $487 billion from the governments fiscal year 2012 through2021. These automatic across-the-board budget cuts resulting from sequestration are having and may continue to have significant consequences to our business and industry. In March 2013, Congress passed legislation that was a continuation of acontinuing resolution (CR) enacted in September 2012 as well as five full, detailed appropriations bills, which finances all federal government activities through September 30, 2013, the end of its fiscal year. This legislation includedadjusted spending levels for programs in order to protect high-priority programs and better manage the sequester.   In years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operationsare funded through a CR that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operatesunder a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government continue to be provided through CRs during itsfiscal year beginning on October 1, 2013 and extended through the entire government 2014 fiscal year, and sequestration continues as part of the implementation of the Budget Act, it could have significant consequences to our business and ourindustry. If Congress cannot complete its budget process or does not pass a CR by the end of September 2013, a shut down of the federal government will result on October 1, 2013. Were a shut down to occur, it could result in our incurringsubstantial labor or other costs without being reimbursed under our contracts, or the delaying or cancelling of certain programs. This could also have an adverse effect on our business and our industry.   At times, we may continue to work without funding, and useour funds in order to meet our customers desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at this time which of our programs funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congressin the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.    Additionally, our business could be seriously affected if the demand for and priority of funding for combat operations in Afghanistan decreases faster than we have anticipated or if we experience anincrease in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.   Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting thegovernment not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or morebase years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, ourcontracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenueshortfalls from those anticipated.    Federalgovernment contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.    Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts,including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;  14 Table of Contents   claim rights in systems and software developed by us;     suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;     impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.   If the government terminates a contract for convenience, wemay recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may beliable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable orpotentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work onthe design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a programor contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain ofour contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If we fail to establish and maintain importantrelationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.   To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officialsof various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationshipswith government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive significant revenue from contracts and taskorders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.    Substantially all of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through acompetitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused manygovernment clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increasedcompetition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outsidethe intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number ofbidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contractingbase.   15 Table of ContentsThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:     we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest orchallenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.   If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may beprevented from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected andthat could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently acompetitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significantcontracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.   Many of our federal government contracts require us to havesecurity clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees loseor are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the requiredsecurity clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations,and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.   We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts whichaffect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:     allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss ofsecurity clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.   16 Table of ContentsThe federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manneradverse to us.    The federal governmentmay change its procurement practices, such as in proposed acquisition reforms, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or othergovernment-wide contracts, adopt new socio-economic requirements, or change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding thechanges and what actual impacts they may have on contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts or adversely affect our future profit margin. Any new contracting methods could be costly oradministratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Restrictions on or other changes to the federal governments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.   We derive a significant amount ofrevenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors(i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our contracts and administrative processes and systemsare subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.    Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense ContractManagement Agency (DCMA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure andcompliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems.Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems isfound not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner.Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, wemay be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. Inaddition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred onwork performed after June 30, 2005 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of anyexisting or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates our profitability could be adversely affected.  Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on   17 Table of Contentsrelationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.    We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which couldreduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.    Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate ofthe future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    The maximumcontract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from governmentcontracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amountof goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated.    Without additionalCongressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could significantly harm our prospects.   Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for thesecontracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequentCongressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to thesecontracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Employee misconduct, includingsecurity breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.   We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect ourbusiness and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs ingovernment contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access tosuch critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could faceunknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.   18 Table of ContentsOur failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior managementteam, could adversely affect our business.   Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need toserve our clients effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource.Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling thesepositions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs ofperforming our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technicalpersonnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our businessbecause personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our seniorexecutives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our markets are highly competitive, and many of thecompanies we compete against have substantially greater resources.    The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financedand better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenuemay decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and competemore effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause ouractual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to the unpredictability of the federal governments budgeting process and policy priorities.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuatesignificantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies maybe forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes inpresidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which inturn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.   19 Table of ContentsWe may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accuratelyestimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.    We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 28.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2013 and 28.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2012 fromfixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on afixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that ouractual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects.These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused byfactors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with stategovernment clients. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix ofour contracts and programs.    AtJune 30, 2013, our backlog included cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially andadversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularlyunder incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.    Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.   Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorizedintruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. Like other global companies, we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions. Prior cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will avoid such impact in thefuture. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend ouroperations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actualresults could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions,we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   20 Table of ContentsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms andtherefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer toour clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integratingnew acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:      increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses ortheir employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or othercustomers; and      acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We may have difficultyintegrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquirein the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for theongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss ofkey employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue ornet income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractualobligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our performance of government contracts may involve theissuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis theagreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract fordefault. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problemexperienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   21 Table of ContentsThe federal governments appropriation process and other factors may delay thecollection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.   We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our businessoperations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may bematerially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, whichwould adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. In February 2012, a DefenseFederal Acquisition Regulations rule became final, requiring DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractors businesssystems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed.If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditionscould cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.   Goodwill accounts for $1.5 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, orwhen evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairmentof recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.   Our operations involve several risks and hazards,including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect ouroperating results.    Our federal businessincludes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing politicalupheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpectedcosts for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties whoare injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, ourinsurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   22 Table of ContentsOur failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rightsmay harm our competitive position.    Oursuccess depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of ourconfidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriatingour copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of ourinternational operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our international operations comprised 3.7 percent of our revenue in FY2013 and 3.0 percent of our revenue in FY2012. Our international operations are subject to risks associatedwith operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or politicalchanges.    Approximately 70.0 percent of therevenue generated by our international operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in Europe on thetelecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to clients in industries thatare new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple taxstructures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our senior secured credit facility (the CreditFacility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.   The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financialrestrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;     paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;     exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;     amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and     engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.   The failure to comply with any of these covenants would causea default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financingis available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.   23 Table of ContentsDespite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The Credit Facility consists of a $750.0million revolving credit facility and a $150.0 million term loan facility. At June 30, 2013, $180.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $131.2 million was outstanding under the term loan. In addition, we have $300.0million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due May 1, 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debt in the future by drawing down on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and have flexibilityunder the Credit Facility to increase the term loan facility or the revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount as of June 30, 2013 of up to $150.0 million with applicable lender approvals. Subsequent to June 30, 2013, this amount wasincreased to the greater of $250.0 million or 2.75 times the senior secured leverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in theagreement governing the Credit Facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay oursubstantial debt.    Interest payments onthe Notes are due each May and November and the outstanding principal amount comes due on May 1, 2014. In order to meet this payment obligation we may have to amend or refinance our Credit Facility which we may not be able to do at the expectedtime, in the amounts we would like, or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional liquidity from alternative sources in a timely fashion or on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. As ofJune 30, 2013, the Credit Facility was scheduled to expire in November 2016. Subsequent to June 30, 2013, the maturity date was extended to August 2018. Principal payments under the term loan facility are due in quarterly installments. Ourbusiness may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.   A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.    The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute adefault. Certain fundamental changes, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, includingthe provisions requiring the increase to the conversion rate for conversions under the Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal ofincumbent management.    The conditionalconversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.   In the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes atany time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. As ofJune 30, 2013, we had $569.6 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all or any portion of thisfacility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, if not waived, would result in the immediateacceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result in an event of default under the Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinanceit, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A material deterioration in our financial condition or operatingresults could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.   24 Table of Contents"
17,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2012-08-28,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
    You should carefullyconsider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we haveidentified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditionsincluding a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions ofexpected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.   We depend on contracts with the federal government fora substantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.   We derived 94.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2012 and94.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 78.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2012 and 79.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 from contractswith agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, theGeneral Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us orsignificantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   14 Table of ContentsOur business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitorsprotesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.   It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in thestart up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.   Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue fromcontracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary prioritiescould directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal governmentagencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.   During 2011, the federal government was unable to reachagreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Act) passed by Congress. Unless Congress and the Administration take further action, the Budget Act will trigger automatic reductions in both defense anddiscretionary spending in January 2013. While the impact of sequestration is yet to be determined, automatic across-the-board cuts would approximately double the $487 billion top-line reduction already reflected in the defense funding over aten-year period, with a $52 billion reduction occurring in the governments fiscal year 2013. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts in sequestration could have significant consequences to our business and industry. In December2011, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2012 to finance all federal government activities through September 30, 2012, the end of its fiscal year. This full year method of financing eliminated much of the uncertaintyand inefficiency in procurement of products and services that characterized the governments first quarter of fiscal year 2012 when the operations of the federal government were financed through a series of continuing resolution temporaryfunding measures.    In years when Congress does notcomplete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levelsprovided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a materialeffect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government by CR be prolonged or extended through the entire government 2013 fiscal year, and sequestration take place in January 2013 as part of the implementation of the Budget Act, itcould have significant consequences to our business and our industry. At times, we may continue to work without funding, and use our funds, in order to meet our customers desired delivery dates for products or services. It is uncertain at thistime which of our programs funding could be reduced in future years or whether new legislation will be passed by Congress in the next fiscal year that could result in additional or alternative funding cuts.   Additionally, our business could be seriously affected if thedemand for and priority of funding for combat operations in Afghanistan decreases which may reduce the demand for our services on contracts supporting some operations and maintenance activities in the DoD or if we experience an increase inset-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.   Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting thegovernment not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or morebase years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts   15 Table of Contentspotential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a governmentclient to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.   Federal government contracts contain numerousprovisions that are unfavorable to us.   Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, someof which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;     claim rights in systems and software developed by us;     suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;     impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.   If the government terminates a contract for convenience, wemay recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may beliable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable orpotentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work onthe design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to develop and install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a programor contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain ofour contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If we fail to establish and maintain importantrelationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.   To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officialsof various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationshipswith government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive significant revenue from contracts and taskorders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.    Substantially all of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through acompetitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will   16 Table of Contentscontinue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and servicesthrough IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustainedpost-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD haveinitiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we arehighly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.    This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:     we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest orchallenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.   If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may beprevented from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected andthat could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently acompetitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significantcontracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.   Many of our federal government contracts require us to havesecurity clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees loseor are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the requiredsecurity clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations,and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.   We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts whichaffect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:     allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;  17 Table of Contents   require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss ofsecurity clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    The federal government maychange its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.    The federal government may change its procurement practices, such as in proposed acquisition reforms, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adoptnew contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economic requirements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.   Restrictions on or other changes to the federal governments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.   We derive a significant amount ofrevenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors(i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our contracts and administrative processes and systemsare subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.    Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit andinvestigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations andstandards. They also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, compensation and management information processesand systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes andsystems is found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timelymanner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegalactivities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federalgovernment. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costsincurred on work performed after June 30, 2005 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent   18 Table of Contentsacquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and if any future audit adjustments significantlyexceed our estimates our profitability could be adversely affected.   Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.   We may not receive the full amounts authorized underthe contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.   Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, andunfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or atall, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenuethat we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract.We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of thegovernment to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which couldsignificantly harm our prospects.   Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for thesecontracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequentCongressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to thesecontracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Employee misconduct, includingsecurity breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.   We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect ourbusiness and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information   19 Table of Contentsand legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national securityand other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of theAnti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance andsuspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees,including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.    Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the developmentof tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technologyservices industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for theforeseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficientlysatisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employmentof our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a criticalelement of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities,which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.   The markets in which we operate include a large number ofparticipants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must alsokeep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or withthird parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, whichmay result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results could bevolatile due to the unpredictability of the federal governments budgeting process and policy priorities.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federalgovernment does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-oncontracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the   20 Table of Contentsrate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-periodcomparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipatedprofits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.   We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 28.0 percent of our total revenue inFY2012 and 24.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoingmaintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to lessuncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis,we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connectionwith the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incurlosses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Ourearnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.    At June 30, 2012, our backlog included cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts.Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance atwhich the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.   Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.   Any systems failures, including network, software orhardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in ourbusiness or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurancemay be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The systems and networks that we maintain for our clients,although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors andomissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   21 Table of ContentsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms andtherefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer toour clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integratingnew acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:      increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses ortheir employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or othercustomers; and      acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We may have difficultyintegrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquirein the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for theongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss ofkey employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue ornet income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractualobligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our performance of government contracts may involve theissuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis theagreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract fordefault. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problemexperienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   22 Table of ContentsThe federal governments appropriation process and other factors may delay thecollection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.   We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our businessoperations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may bematerially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, whichwould adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. A new Defense FederalAcquisition Regulations interim rule became effective May 18, 2011, applying to solicitations issued on or after that date, requiring DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if acontracting officer determines that one or more of a contractors business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. On February 24, 2012, a final DFARS rule became effective, with no substantive changes from the interim rule.Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collectingreceivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditionscould cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.   Goodwill accounts for $1.4 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, orwhen evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairmentof recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.   Our operations involve several risks and hazards,including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect ouroperating results.    Our federal businessincludes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing politicalupheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpectedcosts for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties whoare injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, ourinsurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   23 Table of ContentsOur failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rightsmay harm our competitive position.    Oursuccess depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of ourconfidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriatingour copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of ourinternational operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our U.K.-based operations comprised 3.0 percent of our revenue in FY2012 and 3.3 percent of our revenue in FY2011. Our U.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated withoperating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or politicalchanges.    Our U.K.-based operations are alsosubject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computer software and computer servicessectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may beunsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchangerates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogationservices work in Iraq.    In May 2004,press accounts disclosed an internal U.S. government report, the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that one of our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another governmentreport, the Jones/Fay Report, alleged that three of our employees, including the employee identified in the Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report included a recommendation that theinformation in the report regarding these employees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the U.S. Army for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officerfor appropriate contractual action. Our investigation into these matters has not to date confirmed the allegations of abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought by the governmentagainst us or any of our employees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.    The results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Oursenior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.   The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financialrestrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;   24 Table of Contents   paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;     exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;     amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and     engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.   The failure to comply with any of these covenants would causea default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financingis available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.    Despite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The Credit Facility consists of a $600.0 million revolving credit facility and a $150.0 million term loan facility. At June 30, 2012,$125.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $138.8 million was outstanding under the term loan. In addition, we have $300.0 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We areable to incur additional debt in the future by drawing down on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and have flexibility under the Credit Facility to increase the term loan facility or the revolving credit facility in an aggregateamount up to $300.0 million with applicable lender approvals. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the CreditFacility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay oursubstantial debt.    Interest payments onthe Notes are due each May and November and the outstanding principal amount comes due in May 2014. The Credit Facility expires in November 2016. Principal payments under the term loan facility are due in quarterly installments. Our business may notgenerate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debtor obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.    A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.   The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default. Certain fundamentalchanges, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring theincrease to the conversion rate for conversions under the Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.   The conditional conversion features of theNotes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.    In the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or moreholders elect to   25 Table of Contentsconvert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect toconvert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our networking capital. As of June 30, 2012, we had $475.0 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all orany portion of this facility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, if not waived, wouldresult in the immediate acceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result in an event of default under the Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrowsufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A material deterioration in ourfinancial condition or operating results could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.   "
9,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2011-08-29,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
    You should carefullyconsider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we haveidentified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions,including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions ofexpected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.   We depend on contracts with the federal government fora substantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.   We derived 94.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 and94.8 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 79.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 and 77.8 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 from contractswith agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, theGeneral Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us orsignificantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   Our business could be adversely affected by delayscaused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.   It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in thestart up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.   Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue fromcontracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary prioritiescould directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away   13 Table of Contentsfrom programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right toterminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affectour federal government contracting business are:      the demand for and priority of funding for combat operations in Afghanistan, decreases to which may reduce the demand for our services on contractssupporting some operations and maintenance activities in the DoD;      the funding of some or all civilian agencies through a continuing resolution instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers withinthose agencies to defer or reduce work under our current contracts;      a federal government shutdown resulting from the failure to pass budget appropriations or continuing resolutions, as well as other budgetary prioritieslimiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding;      an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and     reduction of the federal governments use of information technology or professional services.   Our federal government contracts may be terminated bythe government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We derive substantially allof our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agenciesgenerally have the right not to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or toterminate contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.    Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.   Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, someof which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;     claim rights in systems and software developed by us;     suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;     impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.   If the government terminates a contract for convenience, wemay recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may beliable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Certain contracts also contain OCI clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain   14 Table of Contentsother contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair ormight impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to installthat system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   As is common with government contractors, we haveexperienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.   To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business,we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the developmentof a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business andprospects will be adversely affected.   Substantially all of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. Weexpect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government clients to increasinglypurchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure,requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of thecontracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunitiesavailable to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.   This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks,including the following:      we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest orchallenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.   15 Table of ContentsIf we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to clientsservices that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There canbe no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.   Many of our federal government contracts require us to havesecurity clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees loseor are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the requiredsecurity clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations,and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.   We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts whichaffect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:     allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss ofsecurity clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    The federal government maychange its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.    The federal government may change its procurement practices, such as in proposed acquisition reforms, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adoptnew contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economic requirements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors.These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.   16 Table of ContentsRestrictions on or other changes to the federal governments use of servicecontracts may harm our operating results.   We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions fromnew legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of privatecontractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, whichcould reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts andgovernment contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review our compliancewith government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperlyallocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply withrequirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorableoutcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil andcriminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could sufferserious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on work performed afterJune 30, 2005 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of any existing or future auditsand if any future audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates our profitability could be adversely affected.  Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.   We may not receive the full amounts authorized underthe contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.   Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, andunfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or atall, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   17 Table of ContentsThe maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to usis not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government couldturn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain supportfrom other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog willremain unfunded, which could significantly harm our prospects.    Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contractstypically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional fundsto the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to these contracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may notreceive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspensionor debarment from contracting with the federal government.    We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure tocomply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involvemanaging and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples ofemployee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employeemisconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to attract and retain qualifiedemployees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.    Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the developmentof tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technologyservices industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for theforeseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficientlysatisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employmentof our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and   18 Table of Contentsexecute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtainingand maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, which could causeactual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.   The markets in which we operate include a large number ofparticipants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must alsokeep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or withthird parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, whichmay result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results could bevolatile due to the unpredictability of the federal governments budgeting process and policy priorities.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federalgovernment does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-oncontracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore,period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.   Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverseeffect on the market price of our common stock.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which isconducted on a fixed-price basis.    Weperform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 24.5 percent of our total revenue in FY2011 and 20.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require usto price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability toincrease prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates,our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capabilityto complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts lessprofitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. On rare occasions, these losses have beensignificant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   19 Table of ContentsOur earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.   At June 30, 2011, our backlogincluded cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the typesof long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award feecontracts, is finally determined.    Systemsfailures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, powershortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend ouroperations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actualresults could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions,we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.   One of our key growth strategies has been to selectivelypursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficultyidentifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business.Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:     increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses ortheir employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or othercustomers; and      acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We may have difficultyintegrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquirein the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial  20 Table of Contentsresources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds,the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable toretain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration associated with our acquisitions could materially impact our results of operations.   We made judgments in determining the acquisition-dateassumptions used in estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the acquisitions we made during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 and similar judgments are made as we revalue their fair value each reportingperiod. Our future operating results could be materially impacted if actual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the acquired businesses vary from our estimates.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a primecontractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon whichwe rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, orappropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.   A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default terminationcould expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems withsubcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal governments appropriation process and other factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our businessmay be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or anyprime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to payoutstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billing privileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables ina timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. A new Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations interim rule became effective May 18,2011, applying to solicitations issued on or after that date, requiring DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractorsbusiness systems have one or more significant deficiencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may bedelayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   21 Table of ContentsWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prioracquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.    Goodwill accounts for $1.3 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recordedgoodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions mayindicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.   Our operations involve several risks and hazards,including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect ouroperating results.    Our federal businessincludes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing politicalupheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpectedcosts for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties whoare injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, ourinsurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.   Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protectour proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may beunable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietaryinformation, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of our international operations inthe United Kingdom. Our U.K.-based operations comprised 3.3 percent of our revenue in FY2011 and 3.7 percent of our revenue in FY2010. Our U.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks includefluctuations in the value of the British pound and the Euro, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.   Our U.K.-based operations are also subject to risksassociated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and theimpact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services   22 Table of Contentsto clients in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating tomanaging our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our business could beadversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in Iraq.   In May 2004, press accounts disclosed an internal U.S. government report, the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that oneof our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another government report, the Jones/Fay Report, alleged that three of our employees, including the employee identified in the Taguba Report,acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report included a recommendation that the information in the report regarding these employees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the U.S. Army for determination ofwhether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action. Our investigation into these matters has not to date confirmed the allegations of abusecontained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought by the government against us or any of our employees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.   The results of the investigations and proceedings regardingour interrogation services in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our senior secured credit facility (the CreditFacility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial conditions.   The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financialrestrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;     paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;     exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including certain sale and lease-back transactions;     amending or modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and     engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.   The failure to comply with any of these covenants would causea default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financingis available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.   23 Table of ContentsDespite our outstanding debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The Credit Facility consists of a $600.0million revolving credit facility (currently undrawn) and a $150.0 million term loan facility. In addition, we have $300.0 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debtin the future by drawing down on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and have flexibility under the Credit Facility to increase the term loan facility or the revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount up to $200.0 million withapplicable lender approvals. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources so long as we satisfy the covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility. If new debt is added to ourcurrent debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.    Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.   Interest payments on the Notes are due each May and Novemberand the outstanding principal amount comes due in May 2014. The Credit Facility expires in October 2015. Principal payments under the term loan facility are due in quarterly installments. Our business may not generate cash flow from operationssufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equitycapital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.    A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.   The Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default. Certain fundamentalchanges, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring theincrease to the conversion rate for conversions under the Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.   The conditional conversion features of theNotes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.    In the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or moreholders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could berequired under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. As ofJune 30, 2011, we had $600.0 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all or any portion of thisfacility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, if not waived, would result in the immediateacceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result in an event of default under the Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinanceit, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A material deterioration in our financial condition or operatingresults could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.   "
8,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2010-08-25,">Item 1A. RiskFactors    You should carefully consider therisks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified asmaterial, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including aglobal economic   13 Table of Contentsslowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters orother disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.   We depend on contracts with the federal government fora substantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.   We derived 94.8 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 and96.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 77.8 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 and 76.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 from contractswith agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, theGeneral Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us orsignificantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   Our business could be adversely affected by delayscaused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.   It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in thestart up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.   Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue fromcontracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary prioritiescould directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal governmentagencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are:      the demand for and priority of funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, decreases to which may reduce the demand for our services oncontracts supporting some operations and maintenance activities in the DoD;      the funding of some or all civilian agencies through a continuing resolution instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers withinthose agencies to defer or reduce work under our current contracts;      budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes infiscal policies or available funding;      an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and     curtailment of the federal governments use of information technology or professional services.  14 Table of ContentsOur federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time andmay contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive substantially all of our revenue from federalgovernment contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not toexercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts couldresult in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.   Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.   Federal government contracts contain provisions and aresubject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:     cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;     claim rights in systems and software developed by us;      suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;     impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and     control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.   If the government terminates a contract for convenience, wemay recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may beliable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Certain contracts also contain OCI clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartialassistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example, when we work on the design of a particular system, wemay be precluded from competing for the contract to install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.   As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain ofour contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   If we fail to establish and maintain importantrelationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.   To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officialsof various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationshipswith government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  15 Table of ContentsWe derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through acompetitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.   Substantially all of our contracts and task orders with thefederal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changes in theprocurement process have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded tomultiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work undersuch contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect ofsuch programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy andpractice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.   This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:     we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest orchallenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.    If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to clients services that are purchased underthose contracts for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that wewill win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Ourbusiness may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.   Many of our federal government contracts require us to havesecurity clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees loseor are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the requiredsecurity clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  16 Table of ContentsWe must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply couldcause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.   We must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts whichaffect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:     allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.   Our failure to comply with these or other laws andregulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal government may change its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.   The federal government may change its procurement practices,such as in proposed acquisition reforms, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt newsocio-economic requirements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty surrounding the changes and what actual impacts they may have on contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any newcontracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Restrictions on or other changes to the federalgovernments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.   We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions fromnew legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e., insourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of privatecontractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, whichcould reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts andgovernment contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review our compliancewith government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperlyallocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply withrequirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or   17 Table of Contentsotherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or anothergovernment agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrativesanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegationsof impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on work performed after June 30, 2005 have not yet been completed.In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and, if any future audit adjustmentssignificantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.   Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating resultscould differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.   We may not receive the full amounts authorized underthe contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.   Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, andunfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or atall, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenuethat we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract.We also derive revenue from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of thegovernment to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which couldsignificantly harm our prospects.   Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for thesecontracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequentCongressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to thesecontracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.   18 Table of ContentsEmployee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of clientsand our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.   We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect ourbusiness and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs ingovernment contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access tosuch critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could faceunknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.   Our continued success depends to asubstantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon theexpertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience highattrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantialresources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and causeour actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employmentof our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a criticalelement of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities,which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.   The markets in which we operate includea large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in ourindustry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationshipsamong themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trendtowards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  19 Table of ContentsOur quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile due to theunpredictability of the federal governments budgeting process and policy priorities.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federalgovernment does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-oncontracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore,period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.   Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverseeffect on the market price of our common stock.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which isconducted on a fixed-price basis.    Weperform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 20.6 percent of our total revenue in FY2010 and 19.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require usto price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability toincrease prices. Many of our engagements are also on a T&M basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates,our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects.These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused byfactors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with stategovernment clients. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix ofour contracts and programs.    AtJune 30, 2010, our backlog included cost reimbursable, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially andadversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularlyunder incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.   Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.   Any systems failures, including network, software orhardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in ourbusiness or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurancemay be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  20 Table of ContentsThe systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant intheir design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurancemay be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty identifying and executingacquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.   One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federalgovernment clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management isinvolved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:     increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses ortheir employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or othercustomers; and      acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.   Each of these types of risks could cause our actual resultsto differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materiallyand adversely from those anticipated.   The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquirein the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for theongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss ofkey employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue ornet income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Changes in the estimated fair value of contingentconsideration associated with our acquisitions could materially impact our results of operations.   We made judgments in determining the acquisition-date assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the contingent considerationassociated with the acquisitions we made during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 and similar judgments are made as we revalue their fair value each reporting period. Our future operating results could be materially impacted if actualearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the acquired businesses vary from our estimates.   21 Table of ContentsIf our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performanceas a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our performance of government contracts may involve theissuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis theagreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.   A subcontractors performance deficiency could result inthe government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and taskorders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal governments appropriation process andother factors may delay the collection of our receivables, and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables in a timely manner.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue ourbusiness operations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial conditionmay be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. In addition, the DCAA may revoke our direct billingprivileges, which would adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner. Contracting officers have the authority to impose contractual withholdings, which can also adversely affect our ability to collect timely. Currently,proposed regulatory changes that would require DoD contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels based upon assessments of a contractors business systems are in the public comment reviewprocess. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collectingreceivables, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditionscould cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.   Goodwill accounts for $1.2 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, orwhen evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairmentof recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.   Our operations involve several risks and hazards,including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e., counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect ouroperating results.    Our federal businessincludes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e., counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing politicalupheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped  22 Table of Contentsin the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these typesof accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.   We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk andpotential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bearsignificant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to adequately protect our confidentialinformation and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.   Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although ouremployees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to takeappropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results coulddiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of our international operations inthe United Kingdom. Our U.K.-based operations comprised 3.7 percent of our revenue in FY2010 and 2.9 percent of our revenue in FY2009. Our U.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks includefluctuations in the value of the British pound, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.   Our U.K.-based operations are also subject to risksassociated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and theimpact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. We are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Otherfactors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of thesefactors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogationservices work in Iraq.    In May 2004,press accounts disclosed an internal U.S. government report, the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that one of our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another governmentreport, the Jones/Fay Report, alleged that three of our employees, including the employee identified in the Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report included a recommendation that theinformation in the report regarding these employees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the U.S. Army for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officerfor appropriate contractual action. Our investigation into these matters has not to date confirmed the allegations of abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought by the governmentagainst us or any of our employees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.   23 Table of ContentsThe results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services inIraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions whichmay have an impact on our business, operating results and financial conditions.   The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. Theserestrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;     paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;     making capital expenditures above specified levels;      exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including sale and lease-back transactions;     modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and     engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.   The failure to comply with any of these covenants would causea default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financingis available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.   Despite our substantial debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The Credit Facility consists of a $240.0 million revolvingcredit facility and a $350.0 million term loan facility. In addition, we have $300.0 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debt in the future and have flexibilityunder the Credit Facility to increase the revolving credit facility to $450.0 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   Servicing our debt requires a significant amount ofcash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.   Our Credit Facility expires in May 2011. Prior to the expiration of the Credit Facility, we intend to establish a new multi-year term loanand revolving credit agreement. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Subsequently, our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service ourdebt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may beonerous or highly dilutive.   24 Table of ContentsA change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.   The Credit Facility provides that certain change in controlevents with respect to us will constitute a default. A fundamental change, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. If investors in theNotes exercise the repurchase right due to a fundamental change, it may cause a default under the Credit Facility, even if the fundamental change itself does not cause a default on the Credit Facility, due to the financial effect of such arepurchase on us. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring the increase to the conversion rate for conversions under the Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstancesmake more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.   The conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.   In the event the conditional conversionfeatures of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any convertedprincipal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of theoutstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. As of June 30, 2010, we had $240.0 million available under our revolving credit facility,which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all or any portion of this facility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure topay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, if not waived, would result in the immediate acceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would alsoresult in an event of default under the Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable thanthe terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A material deterioration in our financial condition or operating results could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of ourcommon stock to decline.   "
5,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2009-08-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. andnon-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns,natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government for asubstantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.    We derived 96.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 and 95.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 from federalgovernment contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 76.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 and 74.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal governmentcontracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, with the General Services Administration, or any significant agencyin the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does withus, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.    Our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in Iraq.   In May 2004, press accounts disclosed an internalU.S. government report, the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that one of our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi   12 Table of Contentsprisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another government report, the Jones/Fay Report, alleged that three of our employees, including the employee identifiedin the Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report included a recommendation that the information in the report regarding these employees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the U.S. Army fordetermination of whether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action. Our investigation into these matters has not to date confirmed theallegations of abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought by the government against us or any of our employees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.    The results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogationservices in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in thedelay of the initiation of work.    It can take manymonths to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in the start up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our business could be adversely affected bychanges in budgetary priorities of the federal government.    Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal governmentcontract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change infederal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Anysuch actions could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are:      the continuing demand and priority of funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which may reduce the demand for our services on contracts supportingsome operations and maintenance activities in the DoD;      the funding of some or all civilian agencies through a continuing resolution instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers within those agenciesto defer or reduce work under our current contracts;      budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policiesor available funding;      an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and      curtailment of the federal governments use of information technology or professional services.    Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government atany time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive substantially all of our revenue fromfederal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the rightnot to exercise these option periods. In   13 Table of Contentsaddition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not toexercise option periods or to terminate contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.    Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.    Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws andregulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;      claim rights in systems and software developed by us;      suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;      impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.    If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlementexpenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuringundelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizationalconflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice tothe government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded fromcompeting for the contract to install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    As is common with governmentcontractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contractcould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.    To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in parton establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formalbid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.    Wederive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.   Substantially all of our contracts and task orderswith the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changesin the procurement   14 Table of Contentsprocess have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and othergovernment-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each suchcontract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside the intended scope of the contracts, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fitsproperly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, wemight not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.    This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:      we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;      we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and      we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge couldresult in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.    If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a numberof years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Inaddition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that wewill be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our business may suffer if we or our employees areunable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.    Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experienceand security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win newbusiness and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derivethe revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from thoseanticipated.    We must observe laws and regulationsrelating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrialsecurity regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:      allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;  15 Table of Contents   require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;      require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and      require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances,suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal government may change its procurement or other practicesin a manner adverse to us.    The federal government maychange its procurement practices, such as in proposed acquisition reforms, or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or othergovernment-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economic requirements. In all such cases, there is uncertainty of where the changes are going to end up and what actual impacts they may have on contractors. These changes could impair our ability toobtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Restrictions on or other changes to the federalgovernments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.    We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation, regulations or government union pressures, on the nature andamount of services the government may obtain from private contractors (i.e. in-sourcing versus outsourcing). Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.    Ourcontracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the DefenseContract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure andcompliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating,compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed.Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for orperform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a governmentinvestigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension ordebarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adverselyfrom those anticipated. DCAA audits for costs incurred on work performed after June 30, 2004 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent   16 Table of Contentsacquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not know the outcome of any existing or future audits and, if anyfuture audit adjustments significantly exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.    Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.    We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as asubcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract couldimpact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results coulddiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.    We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contractsincluded in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.    Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment of goods and services, and unfunded backlog,which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantialportion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenues from IDIQ contracts, which do not require thegovernment to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could significantly harm our prospects.    Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriatesfunds for these contracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfundedpending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of optionsrelating to these contracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may generate results that differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Employee misconduct,including security breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.    We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business andreputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information   17 Table of Contentsand legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protectinginformation involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct couldinclude time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines andpenalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including oursenior management team, could adversely affect our business.    Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for ourclients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, andtechnology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting andtraining these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs,limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our seniormanagement team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element ofobtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, whichcould cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.    The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitorsmay compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If weare unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs. Asa result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies who are better able tocompete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, ifthe federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new andfollow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in   18 Table of Contentspresidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicationof our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results maynot meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.    We may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on afixed-price basis.    We perform a portion of ourengagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 19.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2009 and 21.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts bypredicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many ofour engagements are also on a time-and-materials (T&M) basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, ouractual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to completethe task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable orunprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In theevent that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.    At June 30, 2009, our backlog included cost reimbursement, T&M andfixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contractsundertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.   Systems failures may disrupt our business and have anadverse effect on our results of operations.    Anysystems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause lossof data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Ourproperty and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adverselyfrom those anticipated.    The systems and networks that wemaintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contracttermination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   19 Table of ContentsWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore maygrow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our keygrowth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing marketsand clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may bediverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks inexecuting our acquisition strategy, including:      increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;      our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employeesto comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and     acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty integrating the operations of anycompanies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future.The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoingdevelopment of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of keyemployees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or netincome we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations,our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance ofsubcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-uponsupplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose usto liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractorscould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   20 Table of ContentsOur business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow,provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices forany reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. Some primecontractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables, it couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantialwrite-downs that would reduce our operating income.    Goodwill accounts for $1.1 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factorsrequiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recordedamount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.    Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e. counterterrorism training services).If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.    Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e. counterterrorism training) thatrequire us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will sufferinjury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types ofaccidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potentialliabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costsfrom an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitiveposition.    Our success depends, in part, upon ourability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. Inaddition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks orother proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   21 Table of ContentsWe face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations.   We conduct the majority of our internationaloperations in the United Kingdom. Our U.K.-based operations comprised 2.9 percent of our revenue in FY2009 and 3.8 percent of our revenue in FY2008. Our U.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. Theserisks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.    Our U.K.-based operations are also subject to risks associated with operatinga commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentratedand intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. Our revenue from this business declined during FY2009 over revenue from such business in FY2008 primarily as a result of the weakening of the British pound versus theUnited States dollar. We are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us and our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating tomanaging our business internationally, integrating recent acquisitions, multiple tax structures and continued adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated.    Our senior secured credit facility(the Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial conditions.    The Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financialtests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing certain amounts of additional debt;      paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;      making capital expenditures above specified levels;      exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;      issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;      transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including sale and lease-back transactions;      modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and      engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.    The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the Credit Facility. A default, if not waived,could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable tous.    Despite our substantial debt, we may incuradditional indebtedness.    The Credit Facility consistsof a $240 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million term loan. In addition, we have $300 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debt in the future and haveflexibility under the Credit Facility to increase the revolving credit facility to $450 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   22 Table of ContentsServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flowfrom our business to pay our substantial debt.    OurCredit Facility expires in May 2011 and our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive andother factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may berequired to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capitalmarkets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in default on our debt obligations.    A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.   The Credit Facility provides that certain change incontrol events with respect to us will constitute a default. A fundamental change, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. If investorsin the Notes exercise the repurchase right for a fundamental change, it may cause a default under the Credit Facility, even if the fundamental change itself does not cause a default on the Credit Facility, due to the financial effect of such arepurchase on us. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring the increase to the conversion rate for conversions under the Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstancesmake more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.    The conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.   In the event the conditional conversion features ofthe Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principalthrough the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstandingprincipal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. As of June 30, 2009, we had $239.4 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we coulduse to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all or any portion of this facility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay therequired cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, if not waived, would result in the immediate acceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result inan event of default under the Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the termsof our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A material deterioration in our financial condition or operating results could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our commonstock to decline.    The Financial Accounting StandardsBoard (FASB) has issued a new accounting standard applicable to the Notes. Under this new standard, we will have to report non-cash interest expense for the Notes that is significantly higher than interest expense attributable to the coupon rate onthe Notes. This change will reduce our net income and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock as a result.    In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion(Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP 14-1). This new standard will require us to separately account for the liability and equity (conversion option) components of   23 Table of Contentsthe Notes, and to recognize interest expense on the Notes using an interest rate in effect for comparable debt instruments that do not contain conversionfeatures. Under FSP 14-1, the difference between the proceeds of the debt and the value allocated to the liability component will be recorded, in additional paid-in capital, as the value of the conversion option. The amount of the conversion optionthus effectively represents additional interest cost on the liability component and will be amortized over the expected life of the security. The interest rate to be used under FSP 14-1 of 6.9 percent is significantly higher than the rate on theNotes that is currently used, which is equal to the coupon rate of 2.125 percent.    FSP 14-1 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009 and will require retrospective application to the date the Notes were issued. Had this new standard been effective for the fiscal year endedJune 30, 2009, our interest expense would have increased by $9.5 million and our diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $0.19 per share. The higher interest expense will reduce our net income and may cause our stock price todecline. FSP 14-1 will have no direct effect on our cash flow.   "
11,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2008-08-27,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. andnon-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns,natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government for asubstantial majority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.    We derived 95.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 and 94.2 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 from federalgovernment contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 74.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 and 71.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal governmentcontracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, with the General Services Administration, or any significant agencyin the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does withus, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.    Our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in Iraq.   In May 2004, press accounts disclosed an internalU.S. government report, the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that one of our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another government report, the Jones/Fay Report, allegesthat three of our employees, including the employee identified in the Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report includes a recommendation that the information in the report regarding theseemployees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the U.S. Army for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action. Ourinvestigation into these matters has not to date confirmed the allegations   12 Table of Contentsof abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought by the government against us or any of ouremployees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.    Theresults of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by ourcompetitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.    It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in the start up andfunding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.    Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts withthe federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directlyaffect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reducetheir purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are:      the continuing demand and priority of funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which may reduce the demand for our services on contracts supportingsome operations and maintenance activities in the DoD;      the funding of some or all civilian agencies through a continuing resolution instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers within those agenciesto defer or reduce work under our current contracts;      budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policiesor available funding;      an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and      curtailment of the federal governments use of information technology or professional services.    Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government atany time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive substantially all of our revenue fromfederal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the rightnot to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contractscould result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.   13 Table of ContentsFederal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.   Federal government contracts contain provisions andare subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;      claim rights in systems and software developed by us;      suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;      impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.    If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlementexpenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuringundelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizationalconflict of interest (OCI) clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. OCIs arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice tothe government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example when we work on the design of a particular system, we may be precluded fromcompeting for the contract to install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    As is common with governmentcontractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contractcould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.    To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in parton establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formalbid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.    Wederive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.   Substantially all of our contracts and task orderswith the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changesin the procurement process have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. These contracts, some of   14 Table of Contentswhich are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realizerevenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside their intended scope, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that allwork fits properly within the scope of the contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular newcontract, we might not be awarded business because of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.    This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:      we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;      we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and      we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge couldresult in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.    If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be foreclosed from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for anumber of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particularbid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or ouremployees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.    Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experienceand security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win newbusiness and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derivethe revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from thoseanticipated.    We must observe laws and regulationsrelating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrialsecurity regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:      allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;  15 Table of Contents   require us to divest work if an OCI related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;      require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and      require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances,suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The federal government may reform its procurement or other practicesin a manner adverse to us.    The federal government mayreform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economicrequirements. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Restrictions on or other changes to the federal governments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.    We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation,regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors. Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the DefenseContract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure andcompliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating,compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed.Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for orperform contracts. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper orillegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with thefederal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. DCAA auditsfor costs incurred on work performed after June 30, 2002 have not yet been completed. In addition, DCAA audits for costs incurred by our recent acquisitions for certain periods prior to acquisition have not yet been completed. We do not knowthe outcome of any existing or future audits and, if any future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.   16 Table of ContentsFailure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in ourrevenue.    We derive substantial revenue from contractsin which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance onthe contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue andoperating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide thoseservices.    We may not receive the full amounts authorizedunder the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.    Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment of goods and services, and unfunded backlog,which is based upon managements estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantialportion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenues from IDIQ contracts, which do not require thegovernment to purchase a pre-determined amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could significantly harm our prospects.    Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriatesfunds for these contracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfundedpending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of optionsrelating to these contracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may post results that differ materially and adverselyfrom those anticipated.    Employee misconduct, includingsecurity breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.    We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business andreputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in governmentcontracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to suchcritically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and   17 Table of Contentsviolations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks orlosses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to attractand retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.    Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clientseffectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition forskilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and theyare likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractualobligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, webelieve that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personalreputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives couldcause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.    The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants andare highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace withchanging technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third partiesto increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result inthe emergence of companies who are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuatesignificantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federal agencies maybe forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes inpresidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which in turn may have anadverse effect on the market price of our common stock.   18 Table of ContentsWe may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate thecost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.    We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 21.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2008 and 19.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 from fixed-price contracts.Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis orwith limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-materials (T&M) basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent that ouractual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimatesreflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outsideour control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. Onrare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts andprograms.    At June 30, 2008, our backlog includedcost reimbursement, T&M and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types oflong-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award feecontracts, is finally determined.    Systems failures maydisrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages orterrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations orotherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results coulddiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Thesystems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or faceclaims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    We may have difficulty identifying andexecuting acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal governmentclients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing   19 Table of Contentssuitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business,our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounterother risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:      increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;      our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employeesto comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and     acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty integrating the operations of anycompanies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future.The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoingdevelopment of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of keyemployees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or netincome we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations,our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance ofsubcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-uponsupplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose usto liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractorscould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If thefederal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our   20 Table of Contentsbusiness and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons,including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or paymentmay be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future businessconditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.    Goodwill accounts for $1.1 billion of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence ofpotential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recordedgoodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.    Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potential dangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherentin aspects of our federal business (i.e. counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.    Our federal business includes the maintenance of global networks and theprovision of special operations services (i.e. counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war orterrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond our control inconnection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or who may havewrongful death or similar claims against us.    We maintaininsurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims orliabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our failure to adequately protect our confidentialinformation and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.    Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may beinadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent thirdparties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We face additional risks which could harm our business because we haveinternational operations.    We conduct the majority ofour international operations in the United Kingdom. Our U.K.-based operations comprised 3.8 percent of our revenue in FY2008 and 4.2 percent of our revenue in FY2007. Our U.K.-based   21 Table of Contentsoperations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound, longerpayment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.    Our U.K.-based operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial as opposed to a government contracting business, including theeffects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in thosesectors. Our revenue from this business grew during FY2008 over revenue from such business in FY2007 primarily as a result of three acquisitions and the strength of the British pound. While we are marketing our services to clients in industries thatare new to us, our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally, multiple tax structures and adverse changes inforeign exchange rates. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our senior secured credit facility (the 2004 Credit Facility) imposes certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have animpact on our business, operating results and financial conditions.    The 2004 Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certaintransactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing additional debt;      paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock in excess of specific limits;     making certain investments, loans and advances;      making capital expenditures above specified levels;      exceeding specific levels of liens on our assets;      issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;      transforming or selling certain assets currently held by us, including sale and lease-back transactions;      modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and      engaging in certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.    The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the 2004 Credit Facility. A default, if notwaived, could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that areacceptable to us.    Despite our substantial debt, we mayincur additional indebtedness.    The 2004 CreditFacility consists of a $200 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million term loan. In addition, we have $300 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debt inthe future and have flexibility under the 2004 Credit Facility to increase the revolving credit facility to $300 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.  22 Table of ContentsServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flowfrom our business to pay our substantial debt.    Ourability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our businessmay not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such asselling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We maynot be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in default on our debt obligations.    A change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.    The 2004 Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events with respect to us will constitute a default. Afundamental change, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the 2004 Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. If investors in the Notes exercise the repurchase right for afundamental change, it may cause a default under the 2004 Credit Facility, even if the fundamental change itself does not cause a default on the 2004 Credit Facility, due to the financial effect of such a repurchase on us. Furthermore, thefundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring the increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a takeover of ourcompany and the removal of incumbent management.    Theconditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.    In the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time duringspecified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders donot elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a materialreduction of our net working capital. We currently have approximately $200 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversions of the Notes. However, there can be noassurance that all or any portion of this facility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes would constitute an event of default which, ifnot waived, would result in the immediate acceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result in an event of default under the 2004 Credit Facility. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay ourdebt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that are unacceptable to us. A materialdeterioration in our financial condition or operating results could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.    The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued a new accounting standard applicable to the Notes. Underthis new standard, we will have to report non-cash interest expense for the Notes that is significantly higher than interest expense attributable to the coupon rate on the Notes. This change will reduce our net income and could adversely affect themarket price of our common stock as a result.    In May2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP 14-1). This   23 Table of Contentsnew standard will require us to separately account for the liability and equity (conversion option) components of the Notes, and to recognize interestexpense on the Notes using an interest rate in effect for comparable debt instruments that do not contain conversion features. Under FSP 14-1, the difference between the proceeds of the debt and the value allocated to the liability component will berecorded, in additional paid-in capital, as the value of the conversion option. The amount of the conversion option thus effectively represents additional interest cost on the liability component and will be amortized over the expected life of thesecurity. The interest rate to be used under FSP 14-1 will therefore be significantly higher than the rate on the Notes that is currently used, which is equal to the coupon rate of 2.125 percent.    FSP 14-1 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009 andwill require retrospective application to the date the Notes were issued. Had this new standard been effective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we estimate that our interest expense would have increased by approximately $10.5 million,and our diluted earnings per share would have decreased by approximately $0.21 per share. The higher interest expense will reduce our net income and may cause our stock price to decline.   "
7,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2007-08-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    Youshould carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below arethose that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic andindustry conditions, including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or otherdisruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government for a substantialmajority of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.    We derived 94.2 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 and 94.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2006 from federal government contracts, either as aprime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 71.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 and 73.1 percent of our total revenue in FY2006 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be theprimary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, with the General Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community orthe DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects,financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.    Our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in Iraq.    In May 2004, press accounts disclosed an internal U.S. government report,the Taguba Report, which, among other things, alleged that one of our employees was involved in the alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Another government report, the Jones/Fay Report, alleges that three of ouremployees, including the employee identified in the Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report includes a recommendation that the information in the report regarding these employees be forwardedto the General Counsel of the U.S. Army for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution and to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action. Our investigation into thesematters has not to date confirmed the allegations of abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. To date, no charges have been brought against us or any of our employees in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.   On May 7, 2007, we received a letter from Henry A.Waxman, Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requesting documents from CACI in connection with the Committees investigation into the work of government contractors in Iraq. We have cooperated with thatinvestigation, and will continue to cooperate fully with the government regarding investigations arising out of interrogation services provided in Iraq.    The results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and couldcause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   11 Table of ContentsOur business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting majorcontract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.    There is an increasing trend in the number and duration of protests of the major contract awards we have received in the last year. The resulting delay in the start up and funding of the work under these contracts maycause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.    Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of ourbusiness will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in governmentexpenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminatecontracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affect our federalgovernment contracting business are:      the increasing demand and priority of funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which may reduce the demand for our services on contracts supportingsome operations and maintenance activities in the DoD;      the funding of all civilian agencies through a continuing resolution instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers to defer or reduce work underour current contracts;      budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policiesor available funding, including potential government shutdowns (such as that which occurred during the federal governments 1996 fiscal year);      an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and      curtailment of the federal governments use of information technology or professional services.    Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government atany time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We derive substantially all of our revenue fromfederal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the rightnot to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contractscould result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated.    Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.    Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which arenot typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;      claim rights in systems and software developed by us;   12 Table of Contents   suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;      impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and      control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.    If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlementexpenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuringundelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizationalconflict of interest clauses that limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. Organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to renderimpartial assistance or advice to the government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example when we work on the design of a particularsystem, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that system. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    As is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts ourperformance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new businessmay be adversely affected.    To facilitate our abilityto prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities andagencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business andcould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospectswill be adversely affected.    Substantially all of ourcontracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding.Budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through IDIQ contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts. Thesecontracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration of recentpublicity regarding the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside their intended scope, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope of thecontract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded businessbecause of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.   13 Table of ContentsThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:      we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;      we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and      we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge couldresult in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.    If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be foreclosed from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for anumber of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particularbid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or ouremployees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.    Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experienceand security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win newbusiness and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derivethe revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from thoseanticipated.    We must observe laws and regulationsrelating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrialsecurity regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:      allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an organizational conflict of interest related to such work cannot be mitigated to the governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and      require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances,suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  14 Table of ContentsThe federal government may reform its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.   The federal government may reform its procurementpractices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economic requirements. Thesechanges could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy and, as a result, could cause actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Restrictions on orother changes to the federal governments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.    We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation,regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors. Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the DefenseContract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure andcompliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, property, estimating,compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes andsystems is found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome toan audit by the DCAA or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminalpenalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer seriousreputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.    We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we actas a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contractcould tarnish our reputation, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.   15 Table of ContentsWe may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, whichcould reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.    Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually obligated by a client for payment of goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon managements estimate of the futurepotential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adverselyfrom those anticipated.    The maximum contract value specifiedunder a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are notthe sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We also derive revenues from IDIQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a material amount of goods or services under thecontract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of thecontracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could significantly harm our prospects.    Although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts foronly one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressionalappropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate our share of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to these contracts, incalculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may post results that differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Employee misconduct, including security breaches, couldresult in the loss of clients and our suspension or disbarment from contracting with the federal government.    We may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business andreputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in governmentcontracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to suchcritically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknownrisks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materiallyand adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure toattract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affect our business.    Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clientseffectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition forskilled personnel in the information   16 Table of Contentstechnology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortageof people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnelcould increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    In addition to attracting and retaining qualifiedtechnical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to ourbusiness because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of oursenior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.   The markets in which we operate include a largenumber of participants and are highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, wemust also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships amongthemselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towardsconsolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies who are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results mayfluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federalagencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected followingchanges in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securitiesanalysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate due to impairment of goodwill charges required by generally accepted accounting principles.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipatedprofits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.    We perform a portion of our engagements on a variety of fixed-price contract vehicles. We derived 19.9 percent of our total revenue in FY2007 and 20.3percent of our total revenue in FY2006 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance andother supporting or ancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are   17 Table of Contentsalso on a time-and-material basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-price contracts, to the extent thatour actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimatesreflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outsideour control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. Onrare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that we encounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts andprograms.    At June 30, 2007, our backlog includedcost reimbursement, time-and-materials (T&M) and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely dependingon the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, the costs incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive andaward fee contracts, is finally determined.    Systemsfailures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    Any systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders andhackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data, interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications orutilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system oroperational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintainwere to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that wemight incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our key growth strategies has been to selectivelypursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing markets and clients. We may encounter difficultyidentifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business.Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:     increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;   18 Table of Contents   our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employeesto comply with applicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and     acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   We may have difficulty integrating the operations of anycompanies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future.The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoingdevelopment of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of keyemployees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or netincome we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations,our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance ofsubcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-uponsupplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    A subcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose usto liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractorscould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If thefederal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially andadversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly lessfinancial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed. If we experience difficulties collecting receivables it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated.   19 Table of ContentsWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changesin future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.    Goodwill accounts for $848.8 million of our recorded total assets. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwillamounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicatepotential impairment of recorded goodwill. If there is an impairment, we would be required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.    Our operations involve several risks and hazards, including potentialdangers to our employees and to third parties that are inherent in aspects of our federal business (i.e. counterterrorism training services). If these risks and hazards are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our operating results.   Our federal business includes the maintenance ofglobal networks and the provision of special operations services (i.e. counterterrorism training) that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and insome cases war or terrorism. It is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. We could also encounter unexpected costs for reasons beyond ourcontrol in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives. Any of these types of accidents or other incidents could involve significant potential claims of employees, executives and/or third parties who are injured or killed or whomay have wrongful death or similar claims against us.    Wemaintain insurance policies that mitigate against risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover thoseclaims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear significant costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our failure to adequatelyprotect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position.    Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subjectto confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps toenforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materiallyand adversely from those anticipated.    We face additionalrisks which could harm our business because we have international operations.    We conduct the majority of our international operations in the United Kingdom. Our U.K.-based operations comprised approximately 4.2 percent of our revenue in FY2007 and 3.6 percent of our revenue in FY2006. OurU.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpectedlegislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.    OurU.K.-based operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial, as opposed to a government contracting, business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom on the telecommunications, computersoftware and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. Our revenue from this business grew during FY2007 over revenue from such business in FY2006primarily as a result of two   20 Table of Contentsacquisitions and the strength of the British pound. While we are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us, our efforts in thatregard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are difficulties relating to managing our business internationally and multiple tax structures. Any of these factors could cause our actual results todiffer materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our senior secured credit facility (the 2004 Credit Facility) imposes significant restrictions on our ability to take certain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial conditions.   The 2004 Credit Facility imposes significantoperating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:      incurring or guaranteeing additional debt;      paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock;      making investments, loans and advances;      making capital expenditures above specified levels;      creating liens on our assets;      issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;      transforming or selling assets currently held by us, including sale and lease-back transactions;      modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and      engaging in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.    The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the 2004 Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt tobecome immediately due and payable. In such situations, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.    Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we maynot have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.    Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and otherfactors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required toadopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and ourfinancial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in default on our debt obligations.    Despite our substantial debt, we may incur additional indebtedness.   The 2004 Credit Facility consists of a $200 millionrevolving credit facility and a $350 million term loan. In addition, we have $300 million outstanding under our convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 (the Notes). We are able to incur additional debt in the future and have flexibility underthe 2004 Credit Facility to increase the revolving credit facility to $300 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks related to our ability to service that debt could increase.   21 Table of ContentsA change in control or fundamental change may adversely affect us.    The 2004 Credit Facility provides that certain change in control events withrespect to us will constitute a default. A fundamental change, as defined under the Notes, will constitute a change of control under the 2004 Credit Facility, and therefore will constitute a default under such facility. If investors in the Notesexercise the repurchase right for a fundamental change, it may cause a default under the 2004 Credit Facility, even if the fundamental change itself does not cause a default on the 2004 Credit Facility, due to the financial effect of such arepurchase on us. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring the increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain fundamental changes, may in certain circumstances make more difficultor discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.    The conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.    In the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled toconvert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect ourliquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-termliability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. We currently have approximately $200 million available under our revolving credit facility, which we could use to satisfy payment obligations arising from conversionsof the Notes. However, there can be no assurance that all or any portion of this facility will be available at the time any such conversion obligations arise. Our failure to pay the required cash upon conversion as required under the Notes wouldconstitute an event of default which, if not waived, would result in the immediate acceleration of our payment obligations under all of the Notes. Any such default would also result in an event of default under the 2004 Credit Facility. In such asituation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may be available on terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt and, potentially, on terms that areunacceptable to us. A material deterioration in our financial condition or operating results could inhibit our access to additional investment capital and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.    The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currentlycontemplating changes to the accounting standards applicable to financial instruments such as the Notes. If those changes were to be implemented and became applicable to the Notes, we would have to report interest expense for the Notes higher thanthe interest expense we are required to report under current accounting standards.    The FASB is currently evaluating the accounting standards applicable to convertible debentures, like the Notes, that may be settled with a combination of cash and stock. The proposed changes, if implemented, wouldrequire us to recognize the estimated fair value of the conversion option as an original issue discount, and to amortize the discount ratably over the seven year term of the Notes. Generally accepted accounting principles currently applicable to theNotes require us to report interest expense based on the stated coupon rate and transaction expenses. If the proposed changes were to be adopted and made applicable to the Notes, we would be required to include, as a component of interest expense, aportion of the estimated fair value of the conversion option for each year the securities remain outstanding. The total interest rate to be recognized under such modified accounting standards could be more than twice the stated coupon rate of theNotes. If they occur, these changes would reduce our earnings and could adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades, but would have no effect on the amount of cash interest paid to Notes holders, or on our cash flow. We are unable toestimate the likelihood that the proposed changes will be adopted, whether they will apply to the Notes, or the date they would be effective if adopted.   "
6,CACI,CACI INTL INC  -CL A,2006-09-13,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   You should carefully consider the risks anduncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material,but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including a global economicslowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and businessconditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.    We depend on contracts with the federal government for a substantial majority of our revenue, and our business couldbe seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us.    We derived 94.4 percent of our total revenue in FY2006 and 94.0 percent of our total revenue in FY2005 from federal government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We derived 73.1 percent of ourtotal revenue in FY2006 and 72.7 percent of our total revenue in FY2005 from contracts with agencies of the DoD. We expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we weresuspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, with the General Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, or if our reputation or relationship with government agencieswere to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adverselyaffected.    Our business could be adversely affected bythe outcome of the various investigations/proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in Iraq.    Beginning in May 2004, press accounts disclosed an internal government report, the Taguba Report, which contains information regarding the allegedmistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. The Taguba Report alleged that one of our employees was involved with the alleged mistreatment. Another government report, the Jones/Fay Report, alleges that three of our employees, including the one identified inthe Taguba Report, acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in Iraq. The Jones/Fay Report recommended that the information in the report regarding each of these employees be forwarded to the General Counsel of the United States Army fordetermination of whether each of them should be referred to the United States Department of Justice for prosecution, as well as forwarded to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action.    Our investigation into these matters has not to date confirmed theallegations of abuse contained in either the Taguba Report or the Jones/Fay Report. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate fully with the government regarding investigations arising out of interrogation services provided in Iraq.  9 We have never condoned, and will never condone, tolerate or endorse, any illegal or inappropriatebehavior on the part of any employee when working on our behalfbut we will stand firmly by our employees and their right to be presumed innocent until there is verifiable information confirming that they have been involved in misconduct. Ifand when we receive verifiable information indicating any inappropriate or illegal behavior on the part of any employee, we will take swift and appropriate action to redress the matter. To date, no present or former employee of the Company has beenofficially charged with any offense in connection with the Abu Ghraib allegations.    The results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in Iraq could affect our relationships with our clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely fromthose anticipated.    Our business could be adverselyaffected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.    Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participationin federal government contract programs. Changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, or a shift of expenditures away from programs that wesupport or a change in federal government contracting policies, could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise optionsto renew contracts. Any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are:     changes in federal government programs or requirements;     budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or availablefunding, including potential governmental shutdowns (such as that which occurred during the governments 1996 fiscal year);     an increase in set-asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts; and,     curtailment of the federal governments use of technology solutions firms.    Our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisionspermitting the government not to continue with contract performance, and, if lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contractsthat typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. The option periods typically cover more than half of the contracts potential duration. Federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these optionperiods. In addition, our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience. A decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts could result in significantrevenue shortfalls from those anticipated.    Federalgovernment contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.    Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowingthe government to:     cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;     claim rights in systems and software developed by us;   10   suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency, impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and,    control or prohibit the export of our data and technology.    If the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on workcompleted prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items andservices from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. Certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest clausesthat limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. Organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) arise any time we engage in activities that (i) make us unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or adviceto the Government; (ii) impair or might impair our objectivity in performing contract work; or (iii) provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. For example (i) when we work on the design of a particular system, we may beprecluded from competing for the contract to install that system; or (ii) when we evaluate the work performed by other contractors on behalf of our government client, we are precluded from evaluating the work of some other part of the Companyor a related entity performed under another contract. Depending upon the value of the matters affected an OCI issue that precludes our participation in or performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    As is common with governmentcontractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected a performance problem that impacts our performance of a program or contractcould cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.    To facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in parton establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formalbid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated.    Wederive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. If we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.   Substantially all of our contracts and task orderswith the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Budgetary pressures and changesin the procurement process have caused many Government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts, GSA schedule contracts and other government-wide acquisition contracts.These contracts, some of which are awarded to multiple contractors, have increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring that we make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract. In addition, in consideration ofrecent publicity regarding the practice of agencies awarding work under such contracts that is arguably outside their intended scope, both the GSA and the DoD have initiated programs aimed to ensure that all work fits properly within the scope ofthe contract under which it is awarded. The net effect of such programs may reduce the number of bidding opportunities available to us. Moreover, even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract, we might not be awarded businessbecause of the federal governments policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base.   11 This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:     we bid on programs before the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;     we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;     we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and,     we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in theresubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.    If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be foreclosed from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for anumber of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particularbid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    Our business may suffer if we or ouremployees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.    Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experienceand security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win newbusiness and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derivethe revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from thoseanticipated.    We must observe laws and regulationsrelating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrialsecurity regulations of the DoD and related laws include provisions that:     allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;     require us to divest work if an organizational conflict of interest related to such work cannot be mitigated to the Governments satisfaction;     require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and,     require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information.    Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarmentfrom contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   12 The federal government may reform its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.   The federal government may reform its procurementpractices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts or other government-wide contracts, or adopt new socio-economic requirements. Thesechanges could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re-competed contracts. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy, and, as a result could cause actual results to differ materially andadversely from those anticipated.    Restrictions on orother changes to the federal governments use of service contracts may harm our operating results.    We derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government. The government may face restrictions from new legislation,regulations or government union pressures, on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors. Any reduction in the governments use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actualresults to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   Federal government agencies, including the DCAA,routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws,regulations and standards. They also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and managementinformation systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not tocomply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the DCAA oranother government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties andadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harmif allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   Failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.    We derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as asubcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs. As a subcontractor or teammate, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract couldtarnish our reputation, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.    We may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contractsincluded in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.    Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually obligated by a client for payment of goods and services, and unfunded backlog,which is based upon managements estimate of the future   13 potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particularperiod, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we willrealize under that contract. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider, meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract. We alsoderive revenues from ID/IQ contracts, which do not require the government to purchase a material amount of goods or services under the contract. Action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to orderthe quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Without additional Congressional appropriations, some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded, which could significantly harmour prospects.    Although many of our federalgovernment contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. As a result, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, andall or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Nevertheless, we estimate ourshare of the contract values, including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to these contracts, in calculating the amount of our backlog. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, our estimate of ourbacklog may be inaccurate and we may post results that differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Employee misconduct, including security breaches, could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or disbarment from contracting with thefederal government.    We may be unable to prevent ouremployees from engaging in misconduct, fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation. Misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations, regulations regardingthe protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts. Many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and othersensitive government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems. Other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of theAnti-Kickback Act. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. As a result of employee misconduct, we could face fines and penalties, loss of security clearance andsuspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees, including our senior management team, could adversely affectour business.    Our continued success depends to asubstantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients, a process that relies heavily upon theexpertise and services of our employees. Accordingly, our employees are our most valuable resource. Competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense, and technology service companies often experience highattrition among their skilled employees. There is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantialresources. Our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs, limit our ability to win new business and causeour actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   14 In addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success willdepend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individualbusiness relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose clientrelationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our markets are highly competitive, and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources.    The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants andare highly competitive. Many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger, better financed and better known companies than we are. In order to stay competitive in our industry, we must also keep pace withchanging technologies and client preferences. If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third partiesto increase their ability to address client needs. As a result, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can. There is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation, which may result inthe emergence of companies who are better able to compete against us. The results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile.   Our quarterly revenue and operating results mayfluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. In particular, if the federal government does not adopt, or delays adoption of, a budget for each fiscal year beginning on October 1, or fails to pass a continuing resolution, federalagencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow-on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding. Further, the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected followingchanges in presidential administrations and senior government officials. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.    Our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securitiesanalysts or investors, which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate due to impairment of goodwill charges required by recent changes in accounting standards.   We may lose money or generate less than anticipatedprofits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed-price basis.    We perform a portion of our engagements on a fixed-price basis. We derived 20.3 percent of our total revenue in FY2006 and 18.0 percent of our totalrevenue in FY2005 from fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance. In addition, some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting orancillary services on a fixed-price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices. Many of our engagements are also on a time-and-material basis. While these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed-pricecontracts, to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    When making proposals for engagements on a fixed-price basis, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completingthe projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the   15 performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable.From time to time, unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed-price contracts, primarily in connection with state government clients. On rare occasions, these losses have been significant. In the event that weencounter such problems in the future, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.    At June 30, 2006, our backlog included both cost reimbursement andfixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially and adversely depending on the types of long-term government contracts undertaken, thecosts incurred in their performance, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.    Systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect onour results of operations.    Any systems failures,including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data,interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. In addition, the failure or disruption of our mail, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property andbusiness interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from thoseanticipated.    The systems and networks that we maintain for ourclients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Ourerrors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions onfavorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.    One of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we have expanded our base of federal government clients, increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients anddeepened our penetration of existing clients. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects, which could cause our actual results to differmaterially and adversely from those anticipated. We may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:     increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;     our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply withapplicable laws or regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and health, safety and environmental laws, or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and,    acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.    Each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   16 We may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could causeactual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    The success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations mayresult in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties includethe integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of differentcorporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings thatwe anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future businesscould be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of thework we are obligated to deliver to our clients. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact ourability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.    Asubcontractors performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverseeffect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.    Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables.    We depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow,provide working capital, pay debt and continue our business operations. If the federal government, any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices forany reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget.   Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantlyless financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed.    If we experience difficulties collecting receivables it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.   The Company has substantial investments in recordedgoodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce the Companys operating income.    Goodwill accounts for approximately $722 million of the Companysrecorded total assets. The Company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, adecrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill.   17 Our global networks and other business commitments require our employees to travel to potentiallydangerous places, which may result in injury or other negative impact to key employees.    Our domestic business involves the maintenance of global networks and provision of other services that require us to dispatch employees to variouscountries around the world. These countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest, and in some cases war or terrorism. Certain senior level employees or executives are, on occasion, part of the teams deployed to provide services in thesecountries. As a result, it is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm, or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments. It is also possible that we will encounter unexpected costs inconnection with the repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control. These problems could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our failure to adequately protect our confidential information andproprietary rights may harm our competitive position.    Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to determisappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties frominfringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    We face additional risks which could harm our business because we haveinternational operations.    Our internationaloperations consist of our U.K.-based business which conducts the majority of its business in the United Kingdom. Our international operations comprised approximately 3.6 percent of our revenue in FY2006 and 3.4 percent of our revenue in FY2005. OurU.K.-based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include fluctuations in the value of the British pound, longer payment cycles, changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpectedlegislative, regulatory, economic or political changes.    OurU.K.-based operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial, as opposed to a government contracting, business, including the effects of general economic conditions in the U.K.s telecommunications, computer softwareand computer services sectors, and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors. Our revenue from this business grew during FY2006 over revenue from such business in FY2005primarily as a result of two acquisitions. While we are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us, our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful. Other factors that may adversely affect our international operations aredifficulties relating to managing our business internationally and multiple tax structures. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.    Our 2004 Credit Facility imposes restrictions on our ability to takecertain actions which may have an impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.    Our Credit Facility imposes various operating and financial restrictions on us and requires us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions maysignificantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including:     incurring or guaranteeing additional debt;     paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our common stock:   18    making investments, loans and advances;     making capital expenditures above specified levels;     creating liens on our assets;     issuing or selling equity in our subsidiaries;     transforming or selling assets currently held by us;     modifying certain agreements, including those related to indebtedness; and,     engaging in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions.    The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our 2004 Credit Facility. A default, if not waived, could cause our debt tobecome immediately due and payable. In such a situation, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and, even if new financing is available, it may not contain terms that are acceptable to us.   "
