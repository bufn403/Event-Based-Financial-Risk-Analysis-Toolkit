7,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2024-03-20,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Risks Related to our Business A large percentage of our net sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Two customers, individually, accounted for at 25.7% and 10.3%, respectively, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, and one customer accounted for 26.9% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on suppliers for components and raw materials and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us. We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production process. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic and other components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the components needed for production. Component shortages may result in an inability to deliver products on time or at all, expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost net sales and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. To reduce the effects of supply chain disruption for our customers, we have increased inventory significantly, which has resulted in a reduction of cash available. If we are unable to sell such inventory or sell such inventory within a reasonable timeframe, it may adversely affect our operations and financial results. 8  Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs. We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We recognize reserves in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for exposures related to the estimated impact from these possibilities. We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and the cost of labor may continue to increase. Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, salespeople and operations personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources and direct labor resources within our highly competitive industries. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on net sales and earnings. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining direct and indirect labor may continue to increase, which will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability. Our engineering net sales depend on our ability to deliver quality value-added engineering services required by our customers.  The markets for our engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel and maintain and enhance our technological leadership. Although we believe that we currently can provide the value-added engineering services that is required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render the engineering services we currently provide obsolete or uncompetitive. The acquisition and implementation of new engineering knowledge, technical skills and related equipment may require significant expense that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers’ changing technological requirements. We operate in highly competitive industries, and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs. We compete against many companies that engineer and manufacture complex electromedical and electromechanical products as well as medical, aerospace and defense, and industrial products. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. 9  Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be product and service pricing, quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in net sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers’ requirements, and deliver to customers’ expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The manufacture and sale of products carries potential risk for product liability claims. We generally are required to represent and warrant to our customers that the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship generally for one year. If a product liability claim results in our being liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position. We have insurance coverage for products liability claims, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim. The Company is majority owned by one group of shareholders, and those shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders.  Curits Squire, Inc. and the Kunin family, collectively as a group, own a majority of our common stock. As a result, our majority shareholder group will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our articles of incorporation, as amended and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with interests of other shareholders. In addition, the majority shareholder group may have an interest in pursuing transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might be inconsistent with your investment objectives. As a majority owned or controlled company, NASDAQ does not require the Company to comply with certain corporate governance rules including that we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on the board, an independent compensation committee, or an independent nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company is required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. Having fewer independent directors or fewer independent members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may result in increased influence of the majority ownership group over business operations. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results. We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our and our customers’ intellectual property and proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. 10  We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. In recent years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings. These initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management. Restructurings could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings, failure to achieve targeted cost savings, and failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the restructuring process. These risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce. We have and may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements or following divestitures. We may consolidate or divest certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to other geographies. If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Risks Related to our Assets We are dependent on our information technology systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions due to physical damage or loss of power on our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.  We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and other sources of physical damage or disruption to the equipment which maintains, stores and hosts our information technology systems. We have taken steps to protect and create redundancies for the equipment that facilitates the use of our management information systems, but these steps may not be adequate to ensure that our operations are not disrupted by events within and outside of our control. 11  Disruptions to our information systems, including security breaches, losses of data or outages, cyber attacks and other security issues, have and could in the future adversely affect our operations and/or financial results. We rely on information systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to store, process and transmit confidential information, including financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and electronic communications, belonging to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and/or us. We monitor and mitigate our exposure to cybersecurity issues and modify our systems when warranted and we have implemented certain business continuity items, including leveraging our multiple sites for redundancies, as well as backup and restore methods inclusive of off-site, secure hosted and cloud based third-party providers. Nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable to, and at times have suffered from, among other things, damage from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, physical and electronic loss of data, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, cyberattacks and security breaches, ranging from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures. These include data theft, malware, phishing, ransomware attacks, or other cybersecurity threats or incidents. The increased use of mobile technologies and the internet of things can heighten these and other operational risks. If we, or the third parties who own and operate certain of our information systems, are unable to prevent such breaches, losses of data and outages, our operations could be disrupted. Also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. There can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. Any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and negative publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulations intended to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and globally. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Compliance with these regulations can be costly and any failure to comply could result in legal and reputational risks as well as penalties, fines and damages that could adversely affect our financial results. We are investing in new technologies which are inherently risky. We have made investments in research and development (“R&D”) of new technologies that we believe will strengthen our relationships with customers if successful. To the extent that those investment efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position may be harmed, and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete more successfully, we believe it is advantageous to maintain an effective R&D program to develop new products and manufacturing processes that will benefit our customers. Our R&D efforts are currently funded through investment of capital generated from operations, and we incurred R&D expenses of $1.2 million and $1.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including development of active optical cables and expanded beam connectors. 12  We do not expect all our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or will not be well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. Our investments in new products and technologies are inherently risky and are a departure from historical business operations. Developing Company owned technology and products is different than our historical manufacturing business. While we believe that this is an important step to further cultivate relationships with customers and partners, the Company has not historically developed its own technologies or products; rather, it has historically developed and manufactured products designed by our customers. Development of new products and technologies may expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of those products. As a result, we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products or technologies are, or are alleged to be, defective. Although we carry product liability insurance, we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Financial Risks If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement, we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated.  Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. Effective as of February 29, 2024, we entered into a new credit agreement with Bank of America. Our new current credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. Our compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business. Our exposure to financially troubled customers, start-up businesses or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.  We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. Also, we provide services and products to new and high growth companies. If our customers experience financial difficulty or lack of funding for operations, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services or products from these customers could decline. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in expenses for doubtful accounts receivable and inventory write-offs, a reduction in net sales, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and in days our accounts receivables are outstanding. 13  Changes in foreign currency translation rates could adversely impact our net sales and earnings. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact our reported net sales and earnings. Substantially all our net sales are transacted in U. S. Dollars. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States and transacted in U.S. Dollars. We have exposures to local currencies for certain net sales in China denominated in Chinese Yuan as well as certain costs incurred at our facilities in China and Mexican that are denominated in Chinese Yuan and the Mexican Peso, respectively. The decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends; investors must rely on stock appreciation for any return on investment in our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment. As a result, investors must rely on stock appreciation and a liquid trading market for any return on investment in our common stock. We expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation. The market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to other issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than other issuers for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources. If we fail to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.  Effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could harm our reputation or operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. As we expand our business operations both within the United States and internationally, we will need to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure control and procedures. 14  Our services involve other inventory risk Our production services primarily provide that we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders. Although, in general, our contracts with our customers obligate our customers to ultimately purchase inventory ordered to support their forecasts or orders, we generally finance these purchases initially. In addition, suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements. A customer’s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us. Engineering changes by a customer or a product’s end-of-life may result in obsolete materials or components. While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory, as well as require customers to reimburse us for these items and/or price our services to address related risks, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or in full, be able to collect on these obligations or adequately reflect such risks in our pricing. In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory if we experience component shortages or longer lead-times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service. In such situations, we may procure components earlier, which leads to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased excess or obsolete inventory in the future. Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital. In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories. These managed inventory programs may result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers. In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer’s facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss. Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers’ credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations. Market Risks Pandemics or disease outbreaks could adversely affect our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations. Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the COVID-19 virus, Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could cause a disruption to our business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, reduced demand from customers, unavailability or restricted availability of our material portions of our workforce, raw materials or components necessary to manufacture our products, or disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products. Any disruption of our operations, our suppliers or our customers would likely impact our net sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. Any of these events could negatively impact our net sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers. Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. 15  An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our products and/or services in all major geographies and markets. If customers are unable to purchase our products or services because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products or services, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to extensive government regulations and industry standards and the terms of complex contracts; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards, or the terms of our contractual arrangements, could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support, privacy and data protection, the regulations that apply to government contracts, and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods. Failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. In addition, we regularly enter into a large number of complex contractual arrangements as well as operate pursuant to the terms of a significant number of ongoing intricate contractual arrangements. Our failure or our customers’ failure to comply with the terms of such arrangements could expose us to claims or other demands and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business. We are registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Also, our US facilities are ITAR compliant which is required for our manufacturing of defense related products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring. If any inspection reveals noncompliance with these regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to risks relating to changes in foreign legal and regulatory requirements. It can be costly and time-consuming for the Company and our customers to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications to operate in these markets. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new medical devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Failure of the Company or any of its customers operating in these markets to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 16  Complying with securities laws, tax laws, accounting policies and regulations, and subsequent changes, may be costly for us and adversely affect our financial statements. New or changing laws, regulations, policy and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC and Nasdaq regulations, domestic or international tax legislation and the implementation of significant changes in the GAAP, present challenges due to complexities, assumptions and judgements required to implement. We apply judgments based on our understanding, interpretation and analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances, historical experience and valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the financial statements are issued. In addition, implementation may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or authoritative entities could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting or reporting standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from net sales-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse effect on our financial statements, including cash flows. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations.  Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China and Mexico increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations. Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as similar federal, state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 17  Global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect the Company. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to Green House Gas (“GHG”) emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns including GHG emissions, and the regulation of such concerns including climate-related disclosures, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. If we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages. We are subject to Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling, and disposal of biological material, chemicals, and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs, and any related penalties or fines. This liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results. "
1,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2023-03-17,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Risks Related to our Business A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.Our largest customer has accounts for 26.9% of net sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. 8  We are dependent on suppliers for components and raw materials and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production process. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic and other components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the components needed for production. Component shortages may result in an inability to deliver products on time or at all, expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. To reduce the effects of supply chain disruption for our customers, we have increased inventory significantly, which has resulted in a reduction of cash available. If we are unable to sell such inventory or sell such inventory within a reasonable timeframe, it may adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs.We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and the cost of labor may continue to increase.Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operations personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources and direct labor resources within our highly competitive industries. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining direct and indirect labor may continue to increase, which will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability. Our engineering revenue depends on our ability to deliver quality value-added engineering services required by our customers.The markets for our engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel and maintain and enhance our technological leadership. Although we believe that we currently have the ability to provide the value-added engineering services that is required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render the engineering services we currently provide obsolete or uncompetitive. The acquisition and implementation of new engineering knowledge, technical skills and related equipment may require significant expense that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers’ changing technological requirements. We operate in highly competitive industries and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs.We compete against many companies that engineer and manufacture complex electromedical and electromechanical products medical, aerospace & defense products and industrial products. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. 9  Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be product and service pricing, quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers’ requirements, and deliver to customers’ expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The manufacture and sale of products carries potential risk for product liability claims.We generally are required to represent and warrant to our customers that the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship generally for one year. If a product liability claim results in our being liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position. We have insurance coverage for products liability claims, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim. The Company is majority owned by one group of shareholders, and those shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders. The Kunin family as a group owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, our majority shareholder group will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, the majority shareholder group may have an interest in pursuing transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might be inconsistent with your investment objectives. As a majority owned or controlled company, NASDAQ does not require the Company to comply with certain corporate governance rules including that we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on the board, an independent compensation committee, or an independent nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company is required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. Having fewer independent directors or fewer independent members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may result in increased influence of the majority ownership group over business operations. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our and our customers’ intellectual property and proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. 10  Risks Related to our Assets We are dependent on our information technology systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions due to physical damage or loss of power on our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and other sources of physical damage or disruption to the equipment which maintains, stores and hosts our information technology systems. We have taken steps to protect and create redundancies for the equipment that facilitates the use of our management information systems, but these steps may not be adequate to ensure that our operations are not disrupted by events within and outside of our control. If our information technology systems fail or experience major interruptions, or the information technology systems of third parties that we rely upon fail or experience major interruptions, due to cyber-attacks or other activities designed to disrupt global information systems, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions and our day-to-day functions. We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property, other sensitive information or cash or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. We have technology security initiatives and data recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for cyber liability, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim. We are investing in new technologies which are inherently risky. We have made investments in research and development (“R&D) of new technologies that we believe will strengthen our relationships with customers if successful. To the extent that those investment efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position may be harmed, and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete more successfully, we believe it is advantageous to maintain an effective R&D program to develop new products and manufacturing processes that will benefit our customers. Our R&D efforts are currently funded through investment of capital generated from operations, and we incurred R&D expenses of $1.5 million in 2022. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including development of active optical cables and expanded beam connectors. 11  We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or will not be well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. Our investments in new products and technologies are inherently risky and are a departure from historical business operations. Developing Company owned technology and products is different than our historical manufacturing business. While we believe that this is an important step to further cultivate relationships with customers and partners, the Company has not historically developed its own technologies or products; rather, it has historically developed and manufactured products designed by our customers. Development of new products and technologies may expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of those products. As a result, we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products or technologies are, or are alleged to be, defective. Although we carry product liability insurance, we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Financial Risks If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement, we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated. Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business. Our exposure to financially troubled customers, start-up businesses or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. Also, we provide services and products to new and high growth companies. If our customers experience financial difficulty or lack of funding for operations, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services or products from these customers could decline. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivables are outstanding. Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings.Changes in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. 12  We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends; investors must rely on stock appreciation for any return on investment in our common stock.We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment. As a result, investors must rely on stock appreciation and a liquid trading market for any return on investment in our common stock. We expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.The market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to other issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than other issuers for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources. Market Risks Pandemics or disease outbreaks could adversely affect our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations. Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the COVID-19 virus, Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could cause a disruption to our business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, reduced demand from customers, unavailability or restricted availability of our material portions of our workforce, raw materials or components necessary to manufacture our products, or disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products. Any disruption of our operations, our suppliers or our customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. Any of these events could negatively impact our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We concluded no impairment of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers.Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. 13  An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our products and/or services in all major geographies and markets. If customers are unable to purchase our products or services because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products or services, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. Legal and Regulatory Risks We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business.We are registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Also, our US facilities are ITAR compliant which is required for our manufacturing of defense related products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring. If any inspection reveals noncompliance with these regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. Complying with securities laws, tax laws, accounting policies and regulations, and subsequent changes, may be costly for us and adversely affect our financial statements.New or changing laws, regulations, policy and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC and Nasdaq regulations, domestic or international tax legislation and the implementation of significant changes in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), present challenges due to complexities, assumptions and judgements required to implement. We apply judgments based on our understanding, interpretation and analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances, historical experience and valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the financial statements are issued. In addition, implementation may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or authoritative entities could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting or reporting standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse effect on our financial statements, including cash flows. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations. Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China and Mexico increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. 14  Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations.Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as similar federal, state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect the Company.Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to Green House Gas (“GHG”) emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns including GHG emissions, and the regulation of such concerns including climate-related disclosures, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. If we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.We are subject to Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling, and disposal of biological material, chemicals, and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs, and any related penalties or fines. This liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results. "
8,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2022-03-17,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Risks Related to our Business A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.Our largest customer has accounts for 26.9% and 23.4% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on suppliers for components and raw materials and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic and other components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the components needed for production. Component shortages may result in an inability to deliver products on time or at all, expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. To reduce the effects of supply chain disruption for our customers, we have increased inventory significantly, which has resulted in a reduction of cash available. If we are unable to sell such inventory or sell such inventory within a reasonable timeframe, it may adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs.We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities. We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operations personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources and direct labor resources within our highly competitive industries. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings.        8                   Our engineering revenue depends on our ability to deliver quality value-added engineering services required by our customers.The markets for our engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel and maintain and enhance our technological leadership. Although we believe that we currently have the ability to provide the value-added engineering services that is required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render the engineering services we currently provide obsolete or uncompetitive. The acquisition and implementation of new engineering knowledge, technical skills and related equipment may require significant expense that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers’ changing technological requirements. We operate in highly competitive industries and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs.We compete against many companies that engineer and manufacture complex electromedical and electromechanical products medical, aerospace & defense products and industrial products. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be product and service pricing, quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers’ requirements, and deliver to customers’ expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We offer a full range of value-added engineering, technical and manufacturing services and support including project management, designing, testing, prototyping, manufacturing, supply chain management and post-market services. The manufacture and sale of products carries potential risk for product liability claims.We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship generally for one year. If a product liability claim results in our being liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position. We have insurance coverage for products liability claims, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim.        9                   The Company is majority owned by one group of shareholders, and those shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders. The Kunin family as a group owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, our majority shareholder group will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, the majority shareholder group may have an interest in pursuing transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might be inconsistent with your investment objectives. As a majority owned or controlled company, NASDAQ does not require the Company to comply with certain corporate governance rules including that we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on the board, an independent compensation committee, or an independent nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company is required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. Having fewer independent directors or fewer independent members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may result in increased influence of the majority ownership group over business operations. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our and our customers’ intellectual property and proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations.  Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        10                   Risks Related to our Assets We are dependent on our information technology systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions due to physical damage or loss of power on our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and other sources of physical damage or disruption to the equipment which maintains, stores and hosts our information technology systems. We have taken steps to protect and create redundancies for the equipment that facilitates the use of our management information systems, but these steps may not be adequate to ensure that our operations are not disrupted by events within and outside of our control. If our information technology systems fail or experience major interruptions, or the information technology systems of third parties that we rely upon fail or experience major interruptions, due to cyber-attacks or other activities designed to disrupt global information systems, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions and our day-to-day functions. We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property, other sensitive information or cash or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. We have technology security initiatives and data recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for cyber liability, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim. Financial Risks If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement, we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated. Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business.        11                   Our exposure to financially troubled customers, start-up businesses or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. Also, we provide services and products to new and high growth companies. If our customers experience financial difficulty or lack of funding for operations, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services or products from these customers could decline. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivables are outstanding. Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings.Changes in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends; investors must rely on stock appreciation for any return on investment in our common stock.We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment. As a result, investors must rely on stock appreciation and a liquid trading market for any return on investment in our common stock. We expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.The market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to other issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than other issuers for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.        12                   Market Risks Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) pandemic have affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting, and is expected to continue to affect, our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced reduced sales, supply chain disruption, product shipping disruptions, reduced customer demand and reduced availability of workforce. Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could cause a disruption to our business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, reduced demand from customers, unavailability or restricted availability of our material portions of our workforce, raw materials or components necessary to manufacture our products, or disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products. Any disruption of our operations, our suppliers or our customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. Any of these events could negatively impact our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The impact of COVID-19 did result in a triggering event for goodwill and long-lived assets in 2020. See Note 4, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for a discussion related to a full impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020. We concluded no impairment of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers.Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our products and/or services in all major geographies and markets. If customers are unable to purchase our products or services because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products or services, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. Our business may be impacted by natural disasters or future climate change. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In countries that we rely on for operations and materials, such as Mexico and China, potential natural disasters or future climate changes could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers’ products and increase supply chain costs.        13                   Legal and Regulatory Risks We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business.We are registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Also, our US facilities are ITAR compliant which is required for our manufacturing of defense related products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring. If any inspection reveals noncompliance with these regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. Complying with securities laws, tax laws, accounting policies and regulations, and subsequent changes, may be costly for us and adversely affect our financial statements.New or changing laws, regulations, policy and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC and Nasdaq regulations, domestic or international tax legislation and the implementation of significant changes in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), present challenges due to complexities, assumptions and judgements required to implement. We apply judgments based on our understanding, interpretation and analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances, historical experience and valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the financial statements are issued. In addition, implementation may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or authoritative entities could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting or reporting standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse effect on our financial statements, including cash flows. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations. Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China and Mexico increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations.Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as similar federal, state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws.        14                   If we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.We are subject to Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling, and disposal of biological material, chemicals, and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs, and any related penalties or fines. This liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results. "
6,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2021-03-23,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers.Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our products and/or services in all major geographies and markets. If customers are unable to purchase our products or services because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products or services, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. We operate in the highly competitive industries and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs.We compete against many companies that engineer and manufacture complex electromedical and electromechanical products medical, aerospace & defense products and industrial products. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be product and service pricing, quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. 7  The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers’ requirements, and deliver to customers’ expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We offer a full range of value-added engineering, technical and manufacturing services and support including project management, designing, testing, prototyping, manufacturing, supply chain management and post-market services. Our engineering revenue depends on our ability to deliver quality value-added engineering services required by our customers.The markets for our engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel and maintain and enhance our technological leadership. Although we believe that we currently have the ability to provide the value-added engineering services that is required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render the engineering services we currently provide obsolete or uncompetitive. The acquisition and implementation of new engineering knowledge, technical skills and related equipment may require significant expense that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers’ changing technological requirements. We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business.We are registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. We are also ITAR registered which is required for our manufacturing of defense related products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring. If any inspection reveals noncompliance with these regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) pandemic have affected and is expected to continue to affect adversely our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to affect adversely, our operations, supply chains, financial condition and results of operations, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our services. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced reduced sales, supply chain disruption, product shipping disruptions, reduced customer demand and reduced availability of workforce. 8  Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could cause a disruption to our business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, reduced demand from customers, unavailability or restricted availability of our material portions of our workforce, raw materials or components necessary to manufacture our products, or disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products. Any disruption of our operations, our suppliers or our customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. Any of these events could negatively impact our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The impact of COVID-19 did result in a triggering event for goodwill and long-lived assets. See Note 4, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for a discussion related to a full impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our assessment we concluded no impairment of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020. We may be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny in the form of an audit or review as a result of our Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.On April 15, 2020, we entered into a Promissory Note with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Promissory Note”), which provides for an unsecured loan of $6.1 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and applicable regulations (the “CARES Act”) of which; funds were received on April 22, 2020. On April 23, 2020, the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) issued new guidance that questioned whether a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would qualify to participate in the PPP under the CARES Act. Subsequently, on April 28, 2020, the secretary of the Treasury and SBA announced that the government will review all PPP loans of more than $2 million for which a borrower applies for forgiveness. Should we be audited or reviewed by the U.S. Department of Treasury as a result of filing an application for forgiveness or otherwise, such audit or review could result in legal and reputational costs as well as significant use of management time. While the Company believes that it acted in good faith and has complied with all requirements of the PPP, if we are audited and receive an adverse or negative finding in such audit, we could be required to return up to the full amount of the Promissory Note, which would reduce our liquidity by such amount and potentially subject us to fines and penalties. We expect that all or a significant portion of the Promissory Note will be forgiven; we plan to apply for forgiveness in the second or third quarter of 2021 before the application deadline. A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.Our largest customer has two divisions that account for 23.4% and 22.5% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components needed for their production. Component shortages may result in expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. 9  Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs.We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities. Our exposure to financially troubled customers, start-up businesses or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. Also, we provide services and products to new and high growth companies. If our customers experience financial difficulty or lack of funding for operations, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services or products from these customers could decline. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivables are outstanding. The Company is majority owned by one group of shareholders, and those shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders. The Kunin family as a group owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, our majority shareholder group will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, the majority shareholder group may have an interest in pursuing transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might impact you inconsistent with your investment objectives. As a majority owned or controlled company, Nasdaq does not require the Company to comply with certain corporate governance rules including that we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on the board, an independent compensation committee, or an independent nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company is required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. Having fewer independent directors or fewer independent members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may result in increased influence of the majority ownership group over business operations. The manufacture and sale of products carries potential risk for product liability claims.We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship generally for one year. If a product liability claim results in our being liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position. We have insurance coverage for products liability claims, but there can be no assurances that the amount of coverage will be adequate or that insurance proceeds will be available for a particular claim. 10  Complying with securities laws, tax laws, accounting policies and regulations, and subsequent changes, may be costly for us and adversely affect our financial statements.New or changing laws, regulations, policy and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC and Nasdaq regulations, domestic or international tax legislation and the implementation of significant changes in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), present challenges due to complexities, assumptions and judgements required to implement. We apply judgments based on our understanding, interpretation and analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances, historical experience and valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the financial statements are issued. In addition, implementation may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or authoritative entities could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting or reporting standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse effect on our financial statements, including cash flows. We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operational personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources within our highly competitive industries. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations. Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China and Mexico increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings.Changes in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our and our customers’ intellectual property and proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. 11  Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations.Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as similar federal, state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be subject to risks associated with our acquisitions, and the risks could adversely affect our operating results.Our strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements. We will continue to pursue and acquire additional businesses in our industries that fit our long-term objectives for growth and profitability. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value we realize and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement, we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated. Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business. 12  We are dependent on our information technology systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions due to physical damage or loss of power on our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and other sources of physical damage or disruption to the equipment which maintains, stores and hosts our information technology systems. We have taken steps to protect and create redundancies for the equipment that facilitates the use of our management information systems, but these steps may not be adequate to ensure that our operations are not disrupted by events within and outside of our control. If our information technology systems fail or experience major interruptions, or the information technology systems of third parties that we rely upon fail or experience major interruptions, due to cyber-attacks or other activities designed to disrupt global information systems, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions and our day-to-day functions. We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property, other sensitive information or cash or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. We have technology security initiatives and data recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business may be impacted by natural disasters or future climate change. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In countries that we rely on for operations and materials, such as Mexico and China, potential natural disasters or future climate changes could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers’ products and increase supply chain costs. If we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.We are subject to Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling, and disposal of biological material, chemicals, and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs, and any related penalties or fines. This liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results. 13  We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends; investors must rely on stock appreciation for any return on investment in our common stock.We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment. As a result, investors must rely on stock appreciation and a liquid trading market for any return on investment in our common stock. We expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.The market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to other issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than other issuers for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources. "
9,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2019-04-01,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers. Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our equipment in all major geographies and markets. If our original equipment manufacturers are unable to purchase our products because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results. We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. We operate in the highly competitive EMS industry and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs. We compete against many EMS companies. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. 7Table of Contents The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business.

The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render the engineering services we currently provide obsolete or uncompetitive.  The acquisition and implementation of new engineering knowledge and technical skills may require significant expense that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological requirements. We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business. We are registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDAs QSR requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. We are also ITAR registered which is required for our manufacturing of defense related products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring. If any inspection reveals noncompliance with these regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Our largest customer has two divisions that account for 23.2% and 24.9% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. 8Table of Contents Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs. We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities. Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results. We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivables are outstanding. Some shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders. Our officers and directors control a majority share of our outstanding common stock and could individually or together exert a significant degree of influence over our affairs. The manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims. We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from ship date. We make no other guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation, warranties to merchantability, fit for a particular purpose, non-infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing. If a product liability claim results in our being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurance coverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position. Complying with securities laws, tax laws, accounting policies and regulations, and subsequent changes, may be costly for us and adversely affect our financial statements. New or changing laws, regulations, policy and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC and Nasdaq regulations, tax legislation and the implementation of significant changes in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), present challenges due to complexities, assumptions and judgements required to implement. We apply judgments based on our understanding, interpretation and analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances, historical experience and valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the financial statements are issued. In addition, implementation may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or authoritative entities could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting or reporting standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse affect on our financial statements, including cash flows. 9Table of Contents Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations. Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings. Changes in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations. Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 10Table of Contents We may be subject to risks associated with our prior acquisitions, and the risks could adversely affect our operating results. The success of our prior acquisitions depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Additionally, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value we realize and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the expected synergies and benefits of any prior acquisition. Acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated. Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business. We are dependent on our information technology systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions due to physical damage or loss of power on our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and other sources of physical damage or disruption to the equipment which maintains, stores and hosts our information technology systems. We have taken steps to protect and create redundancies for the equipment that facilitates the use of our management information systems, but these steps may not be adequate to ensure that our operations are not disrupted by events within and outside of our control. If our information technology systems fail or experience major interruptions, or the information technology systems of third parties that we rely upon fail or experience major interruptions, due to cyber-attacks or other activities designed to disrupt global information systems, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions and our day-to-day functions. We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents 11Table of Contents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. We have technology security initiatives and data recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system. We are engaged in an implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team. The ERP implementation has and will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning, project management and training, additional and significant implementation issues may arise. In addition, our efforts to adjust and centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our ERP implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business may be impacted by natural disasters or future climate change. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In countries that we rely on for operations and materials, such as Mexico and China, potential natural disasters or future climate changes could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers products and increase supply chain costs. "
3,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2018-03-27,"Risk Factors
 In evaluating our Company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The economic conditions around the world could adversely affect demand for our products and services and the financial health of our customers.Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies. An economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our equipment in all major geographies and markets. If our original equipment manufacturers are unable to purchase our products because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms, depressed end-user demand, or are simply unwilling to purchase our products, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. Also, we are subject to the risk that our customers will have financial difficulties, which could harm their ability to satisfy their obligation to pay accounts receivable. Further, an economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements. We operate in the highly competitive EMS industry and we depend on continuing outsourcing by OEMs.We compete against many EMS companies. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale and have more geographically diversified international operations. We also compete with OEM operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing or delaying their decision to outsource. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. 7Table of Contents Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, value-added engineering, technology solutions, geographic location and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers requirements, and deliver to customers expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We offer a full range of value-added engineering, technical and manufacturing services and support including project management, designing, testing, prototyping, manufacturing, supply chain management and post-market services. Our engineering revenue depends on our ability to deliver quality value-added engineering services required by our customers in the future.The markets for our engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel and maintain and enhance our technological leadership. Although we believe that we currently have the ability to provide the value-added engineering services that is required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.

The loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials 8Table of Contents for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components needed for their production. Component shortages may result in expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse effect on inventory carrying costs.We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations.

These changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially 9Table of Contents or otherwise impact how we prepare and report our estimates, uncertainties, financial statements, operating results and financial condition. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, accounting policies and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and may have an adverse affect on our financial statements, including cash flows. We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operational personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources within the highly competitive EMS industry. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations.Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations.

We will continue to pursue and acquire additional businesses in the EMS industry that fit our long-term objectives for growth and profitability. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value we realize and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. We recorded an impairment charge of $908,000 on the goodwill related to the Devicix, LLC purchase as of December 31, 2017. In the event that we do not achieve our earnings projections, further impairment may become necessary. If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated.Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding. Some shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders. Our officers and directors control a majority share of our outstanding common stock and could individually or together exert a significant degree of influence over our affairs. The manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims. We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from ship date. We make no other guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation, warranties to merchantability, fit for a particular purpose, 7Table of Contents non-infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing. If a product liability claim results in our being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurance coverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position. We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees. Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operational personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources within the highly competitive EMS industry. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings. Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations. Laws and regulations related to bribery, corruption and trade, and enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business into China increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions. Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings. Changes in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may adversely affect demand for our products and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency. Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results. We operate manufacturing facilities in Mexico and China. Our operations in those countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations. Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal 8Table of Contents might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be subject to risks associated with our acquisitions, and the risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements. We will continue to pursue and acquire additional businesses in the EMS industry that fit our long-term objectives for growth and profitability. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value we realize and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated. Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business. We are dependent on our management information systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions, including those relating to cyber-security or arising from cyber-attacks, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected. We rely on our management information systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and attacks from viruses or hackers, including cybersecurity threats and incidents. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to targeted measures directed at the Company, its customers, its designs and/or its products. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks, attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful. System failures or interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business may be impacted by natural disasters or future climate change. Natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In countries that we rely on for operations and materials, such as Mexico 9Table of Contents and China, potential natural disasters or future climate changes could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers products and increase supply chain costs. "
4,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2016-03-22,"ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS             In evaluating our company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in ourcommon stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The economic conditions in the United States and around the world could adversely affect ourfinancial results.          Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growthrates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, andliquidity of industrial companies. We operate in the highly competitive EMS industry.          We compete against many EMS companies. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale. We alsocompete with OEM in-house operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respectto price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. 6 Table of Contents         Competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, technology solutions, and price.We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services thatmaybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin.         Theavailability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product,be responsive and flexible to customers' requirements, and deliver to customers' expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processeswhich could have an adverse effect on our business.          As a medical device manufacturer we have additional compliance requirements. We are required to register with the FDA and are subjectto periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's QSR requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, qualitycontrol and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product fieldmonitoring by the FDA. If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, it could adversely affect our operations. A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of amajor customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.          Our largest customer has two divisions that account for 27% and 29% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,respectively. We are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages, extended leadtimes, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.          We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have anadverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increasescould also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials forour operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components needed for their production. Component shortages may result in expedited freight, overtime premiums and increasedcomponent costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships. Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managedwould have an adverse affect on inventory carrying costs.          We face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful inrecovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contracttermination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities. Some shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests ofother shareholders.          Our officers and directors control a majority share of our outstanding common stock and could individually or together exert asignificant degree of influence over our affairs. The manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims.          We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from shipdate.

0,NSYS,NORTECH SYSTEMS INC,2013-03-08,"ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS             In evaluating our company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of aninvestment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and therelated notes.  The economic conditions in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our financial results.          Demand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growthrates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, andliquidity of industrial companies.  We operate in the highly competitive EMS industry.          We compete against many EMS companies. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale. We alsocompete with OEM in-house operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. We may also be at a competitive disadvantagewith respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor.         Theavailability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product,be responsive and flexible to customers' requirements, and deliver to customers' expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our operations.  A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.          Our largest customer has two divisions that account for 24% and 23% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,respectively.  We are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect ourcustomers and us.          We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have anadverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increasescould also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials forour operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components needed for their production. Component shortages may result in expedited freight, overtime premiums and increasedcomponent costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships.  Our customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse affect on inventory carrying costs.          We do face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful inrecovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and 7 Table of Contentsobsoleteinventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for anyknown or potential impact from these possibilities.  Some shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders.          Our officers and directors own a majority share of our outstanding common stock and could individually or together exert a significantdegree of influence over our affairs.  The manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims.          We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from shipdate. We make no other guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation, warranties to merchantability, fit for a particularpurpose, non-infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing. If a product liability claim results in our being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurancecoverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position.  We depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.          Our operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, productdevelopment engineers, sales people and operational personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial andtechnical resources within the highly competitive EMS industry. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings.  Operating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.          We operate a manufacturing facility in Mexico. Our operation there is subject to risks that could adversely impact our financialresults, such as economic or political volatility, crime, severe weather, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreigncurrency fluctuations.  Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations.          Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that governthe discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean WaterAct; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliance with theseenvironmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with theinvestigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and webelieve that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws.         Environmentallaws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate inenvironmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on dischargelimits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs andpenalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We may be subject to risks associated with our acquisitions, and the risks could adversely affect our operating results.          Our strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements. We will continueto pursue and acquire additional businesses in the EMS industry that fit our long-term objectives for growth and profitability. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our abilityto integrate the new operations with the existing operations. 8 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstandingindebtedness may be accelerated.          Our credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply.
