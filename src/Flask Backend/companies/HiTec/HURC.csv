4,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2024-01-05,"RISK FACTORS​In this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business.  The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. ​Risks Related to Our Industry and International Operations​The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve.  As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.​Material adverse developments in global economic conditions, or the occurrence of certain other world events, could negatively affect demand for our products and harm our business.Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. Global economic uncertainty has produced, and continues to produce, substantial stress, volatility, illiquidity, and disruption of global credit and other financial markets. Various factors contribute to the uncertain economic environment, including geopolitical tensions, military conflicts, the level and volatility of interest rates, the level of inflation, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an actual recession or fears of a recession, trade policies and tariffs, and political and governmental instability.​Economic uncertainty has and could continue to negatively affect the businesses and purchasing decisions of companies in the industries we serve. Such disruptions present considerable risks to our businesses and operations. As global economic conditions experience stress and negative volatility, or if there is an escalation in regional or global conflicts, or terrorism, we will likely experience reductions in the number of available customers and in capital expenditures by our remaining customers, longer sales cycles, deferral, or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased price competition, any of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.​Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.During fiscal year 2023, approximately 61% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas.  In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S.  Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:​•trade barriers;•regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies;•differing labor regulation;•governmental expropriation;•domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;•current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;•difficulty in obtaining distribution support;19​•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differences in the availability and terms of financing;•political instability and unrest;•negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs;•foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;•changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and•changes in the geopolitical environment, wars, conflicts, or trade barriers or blockades in the European Union and Asia, which may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries.​Quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all.  Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.  These factors may adversely affect our future operating results.  The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China.  Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, significant delays at one or more of the ports where our products are shipped or received has impacted, and could continue to impact, the amount of time required to ship our products to customers, which could materially adversely impact our business, demand for our products, our ability to meet quoted delivery dates, our results of operations, future operations, and/or financial condition.​Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures, and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.​Finally, a significant portion of our manufacturing, production, and assembly operations are located in certain limited geographic territories, including the People’s Republic of China (“China”) and the Republic of China (“Taiwan”). An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ​20​Additionally, the geopolitical environment and ongoing sovereign relationship between China and Taiwan, including recent heightened tensions between them, could have a material impact on our business. Specifically, if a trade war, tariff, physical or economic blockade, or war ensued and impacted access to or from the Taiwan or Chinese markets or workforce, we could have challenges maintaining production plans or output, accessing the skilled labor necessary to produce our products without interruption, accessing and/or shipping our finished goods, work in progress, or other inventories located in either of those territories, accessing or maintaining our supply base that is located in those territories or elsewhere, and/or otherwise experience significant disruptions in our business. Such disruptions, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In such a case, we may be forced to relocate and/or shift production facilities to other geographic territories to mitigate the risks associated with consolidating our manufacturing operations in such territories, which would likely result in disruptions to our production plans and/or our ability to meet forecasted customer demand in the near and medium term, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, future operations, and/or financial position.​Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.Our sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 61% of our revenues in fiscal year 2023, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro.  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure.  There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.  ​We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of many of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.​​​​​​​​​​​​21​Operational and Strategic Risks​Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements, and competitors’ product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all.  If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.​Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property.  We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration, and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Finally, certain subcontractors, vendors, and third parties provide inputs, components, code, and/or similar items that are complimentary and compatible with our products, software, and controls. If we are unable to secure access and/or rights to any such inputs, components, code, or similar items, our ability to continue to produce our products without interruption could be challenged, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, and demand for our products.​​​​​​​​​​​​22​Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We depend on our wholly owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively.  We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or a significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, military conflicts, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such components in a reasonable period of time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could result in delays or interruptions in our operations, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.​Fluctuations in the price of raw materials and other inputs, especially steel, iron, and energy, could adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials, as well as for other inputs such as energy, are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, geopolitical relationships or conflicts, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials and other inputs increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.  ​The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.​Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.We actively seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest;•diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;•potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;•difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and23​•the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.​Acquisitions may also cause us to:•issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;•borrow and subject us to increasing interest rates;•assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company;•record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;•incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;•incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and•become subject to litigation.​Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business.​Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.”  ​Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information, and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which gives California residents certain privacy rights in the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. Additionally, effective starting January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) revised and significantly expanded the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA also created a new California data protection agency authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA, which could result in increased privacy and information security regulatory actions. Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation, and carry significant potential liability for our business.​24​Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the U.K. and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, strict obligations and restrictions on the collection and use of U.K. and E.U. personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances, a requirement for implementation of certain approved safeguards (such as the use of approved “standard contractual clauses” and the performance of appropriate data transfer impact assessments) for transfers of personal data to other countries that have not been determined by the E.U. or the U.K. to provide adequate data privacy protections, and possible substantial fines for any violations. Brazil, India, South Africa, Japan, China, Israel, Canada, and numerous other countries have introduced and, in some cases, enacted, similar data privacy and cyber and data security laws.​The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results and business.​If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’, or vendors’ data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers, and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers, or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation, and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems, or confidential information.​Like other public, multi-national corporations, we have and will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malware, wire fraud, or other cyber incidents. ​The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive, and therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer, or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant.​25​Public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The full extent to which a global health crisis, such as COVID-19, will impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge as a result and the actions by governmental entities or others to contain it or treat its impact.​The impacts of a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other severe global health crisis could pose the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be prudent or required by governmental authorities.​We, our suppliers, and our customers had modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees during the outbreak of COVID-19.  If a resurgence of COVID-19 or other severe global health crisis occurs, it could disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers’ purchasing behavior or decisions, including reduced demand for our products that could continue for an extended period of time.​Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, fluctuations in demand and other implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in, and could continue resulting in, certain supply chain constraints and challenges. ​Financial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks​Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.​Assets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangible assets, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  ​​​26​We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.  ​We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. ​Changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions [could arise] as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.​​​​"
7,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2023-01-06,"​ ​RISK FACTORS​In this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business.  The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. ​Risks Related to Our Industry and International Operations​The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve.  As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.​Uncertain global economic conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, overall demand.We typically sell the majority of our larger, high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.  Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, global economic uncertainty and business downturns may be exacerbated or exaggerated in markets that are subject to ongoing wars or conflicts or in markets that depend on resources, energy, or supply chains from jurisdictions participating in such wars or conflicts. In particular, many markets in Europe and throughout the world are currently being negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions imposed on Russia. ​Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.During fiscal year 2022, approximately 62% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas.  In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S.  Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:​●trade barriers;●regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies;●differing labor regulation;●governmental expropriation;●domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;●current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;●difficulty in obtaining distribution support;●difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;●differences in the availability and terms of financing;●political instability and unrest;●negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs;19​●foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;●changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and●changes in the geopolitical environment, wars, conflicts, or trade barriers or blockades in the European Union and Asia, which may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries.​Quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all.  Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.  These factors may adversely affect our future operating results.  The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China.  Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, significant delays at one or more of the ports where our products are shipped or received has impacted, and could continue to impact, the amount of time required to ship our products to customers, which could materially adversely impact our business, demand for our products, our ability to meet quoted delivery dates, our results of operations, future operations, and/or financial condition.​Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures, and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.​Finally, a significant portion of our manufacturing, production, and assembly operations are located in certain limited geographic territories, including the People’s Republic of China (“China”) and the Republic of China (“Taiwan”). An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ​20​Additionally, the geopolitical environment and ongoing sovereign relationship between China and Taiwan, including recent heightened tensions between them, could have a material impact on our business. Specifically, if a trade war, tariff, physical or economic blockade, or war ensued and impacted access to or from the Taiwan or Chinese markets or workforce, we could have challenges maintaining production plans or output, accessing the skilled labor necessary to produce our products without interruption, accessing and/or shipping our finished goods, work in progress, or other inventories located in either of those territories, accessing or maintaining our supply base that is located in those territories or elsewhere, and/or otherwise experience significant disruptions in our business. Such disruptions, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In such a case, we may be forced to relocate and/or shift production facilities to other geographic territories to mitigate the risks associated with consolidating our manufacturing operations in such territories, which would likely result in disruptions to our production plans and/or our ability to meet forecasted customer demand in the near and medium term, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, future operations, and/or financial position.​Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.Our sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 62% of our revenues in fiscal year 2022, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro.  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure.  There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.  ​We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of many of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.​The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) withdrew from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” On or around that time, the U.K. and E.U. agreed to participate in a transition period (the “Transition Period”), which expired on December 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade agreement and other aspects of their relationship after the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, free trade continued between the U.K. and E.U. without checks or extra charges. Following the Transition Period, the U.K. is no longer a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. However, immediately prior to expiration of the Transition Period, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues (the “December 2020 Brexit Deal”) – avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, “hard” Brexit.21​We have operations in the U.K. related to Hurco Europe Ltd. (“HEL”), our sales and service business unit located there. Changes resulting from Brexit,  the December 2020 Brexit Deal, and/or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements could subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. We have evaluated the impact of Brexit on us, our subsidiaries, including HEL, our business, and our future operations, operating results, and cash flows, and it has not materially changed our business to date.​In addition, we do not know if the U.K. and E.U. will succeed in negotiating all material terms not otherwise addressed or covered by the December 2020 Brexit Deal or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements and/or if previously agreed upon items will be renegotiated in the future. Changes in these or other terms resulting from Brexit could, similarly, subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing.​Brexit may also cause fluctuations in the value of the Pound Sterling and the Euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to some of our foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, our hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts.​Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related resurgences, governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our facilities, customers, and suppliers are located have imposed mandatory closures, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people, goods, and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns.​The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business. Specifically, many of our sales and service organizations throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific have, at one time or another, been subject to temporary closures or otherwise been required to adopt remote work strategies. We may continue to experience additional temporary facility closures in response to government mandates and/or the incidence of additional spread.​22​Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers’ purchasing behavior or decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our products in certain markets from time to time, which could continue for an extended period of time. Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, fluctuations in demand and other implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in, and could continue resulting in, certain supply chain constraints and challenges. Significant increases in economic and demand uncertainty have led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both our company and our customers and suppliers. In addition, resulting changes in our access to or cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors could cause our intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down the intangible assets for the amount of the impairment. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and related effects remain uncertain and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but such impact has been, and could continue to be, material.​Operational and Strategic Risks​Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements, and competitors’ product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all.  If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.​Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property.  We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration, and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​23​Finally, certain subcontractors, vendors, and third parties provide inputs, components, code, and/or similar items that are complimentary and compatible with our products, software, and controls. If we are unable to secure access and/or rights to any such inputs, components, code, or similar items, our ability to continue to produce our products without interruption could be challenged, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, and demand for our products.​Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We depend on our wholly owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively.  We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or a significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​Fluctuations in the price of raw materials and other inputs, especially steel, iron, and energy, could adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials, as well as for other inputs such as energy, are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, geopolitical relationships or conflicts, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials and other inputs increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Recent inflationary pressures and other factors have resulted in increases to the cost of the inputs or raw materials for our products. Similarly, recently, costs associated with transportation and freight services have previously increased significantly due to limited capacity and/or availability of containers, shipping vessels, and/or receiving port services. If prolonged, and if they cannot be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, these fluctuations in the price of raw materials, product components, other inputs, and/or transportation services could adversely affect our sales, costs, margin, and profitability.​The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.​Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.We actively seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:24​●difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest;●diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;●potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;●difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;●initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;●insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and●the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. ​Acquisitions may also cause us to:●issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;●borrow and subject us to increasing interest rates;●assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company;●record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;●incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;●incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and●become subject to litigation.​For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash impairment charge on goodwill arising from prior acquisitions.  The goodwill impairment charge was attributable primarily to the prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.​Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business.​Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” ​​25​Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information, and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which gives California residents certain privacy rights in the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. Additionally, effective starting January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) revised and significantly expanded the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA also created a new California data protection agency authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA, which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation, and carry significant potential liability for our business. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the U.K. and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer U.K. or EU personal data, as applicable, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue under the E.U. GDPR and up to the greater of 17.5 million Pounds or 4% of annual global turnover under the U.K. GDPR). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering and, in some cases, have enacted, similar privacy and data security laws.​The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results and business.​26​If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’, or vendors’ data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers, and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers, or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation, and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems, or confidential information.​Like other public, multi-national corporations, we have and will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malware, wire fraud, or other cyber incidents. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive, and therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer, or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant.​Financial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks​Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.​27​Assets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangible assets, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge arising from prior acquisitions, and we may be required to record impairment charges on other assets in the future.​We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. In December 2017, the U.S. passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.​Other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.​​​28​"
1,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2022-01-07,"​ ​RISK FACTORS​In this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business.  The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. ​Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our facilities, customers, and suppliers are located have imposed mandatory closures, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people, goods, and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns.​The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business. Specifically, many of our sales and service organizations throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific have, at one time or another, been subject to temporary closures or otherwise been required to adopt remote work strategies. We may continue to experience additional temporary facility closures in response to government mandates and/or the incidence of additional spread.​20​Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers’ purchasing behavior or decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our products, which could continue for an extended period of time. Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, fluctuations in demand and other implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in, and could continue resulting in, certain supply chain constraints and challenges. Specifically, we have begun to experience vendor delays, bottlenecks and significant cost increases in transportation and freight services, and inflationary and similar cost increases for the cost of our materials and components. These issues could impact our ability to timely ship products to meet customer demand and/or impose pricing pressures on our product margin. Should these pressures continue for a significant period of time, and if we are unable to pass on cost or inflationary input increases to customers, our future operations, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.Significant increases in economic and demand uncertainty have led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both our company and our customers and suppliers. In addition, resulting changes in our access to or cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors could cause our intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down the intangible assets for the amount of the impairment. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but such impact has been, and could continue to be, material.​Risks Related to Our Industry and International Operations​The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve.  As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.​Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely affect overall demand.We typically sell the majority of our larger, high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.  Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition.​Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.During fiscal 2021, approximately 63% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas.  In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S.  Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:​●trade barriers;●regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies;●differing labor regulation;●governmental expropriation;●domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;21​●current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;●difficulty in obtaining distribution support;●difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;●differences in the availability and terms of financing;●political instability and unrest;●negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs;●foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;●changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and●changes in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries.​Quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all.  Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.  These factors may adversely affect our future operating results.  The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China.  Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, significant delays at one or more of the ports where our products are shipped or received has impacted, and could continue to impact, the amount of time required to ship our products to customers, which could materially adversely impact our business, demand for our product, our ability to meet quoted delivery dates, our results of operations, future operations, and/or financial condition.​Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.22​Finally, a significant portion of our manufacturing, production, and assembly operations are located in certain limited geographic territories, including the People’s Republic of China (“China”) and the Republic of China (“Taiwan”). An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the geopolitical environment and ongoing sovereign relationship between China and Taiwan could have a material impact on our business. Specifically, if a trade war, tariff, physical or economical blockade, or war ensued and impacted access to or from the Taiwan or Chinese markets or workforce, we could have challenges maintaining production plans or output, accessing the skilled labor necessary to produce our products without interruption, accessing and/or shipping our finished goods, work in progress, or other inventories located in either of those territories, accessing or maintaining our supply base that is located in those territories or elsewhere, and/or otherwise experience significant disruptions in our business. Such disruptions, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In such a case, we may be forced to relocate and/or shift production facilities to other geographic territories to mitigate the risks associated with consolidating our manufacturing operations in such territories, which would likely result in disruptions to our production plans and/or our ability to meet forecasted customer demand in the near term, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, future operations, and/or financial position.​Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.Our sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 63% of our revenues in fiscal 2021, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro.  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure.  There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.  ​We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, most of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.​23​The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) withdrew from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” On or around that time, the U.K. and E.U. agreed to participate in a transition period (the “Transition Period”), which expired on December 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade agreement and other aspects of their relationship after the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, free trade continued between the U.K. and E.U. without checks or extra charges. Following the Transition Period, the U.K. is no longer a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. However, immediately prior to expiration of the Transition Period, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues (the “December 2020 Brexit Deal”) – avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, “hard” Brexit.​We have operations in the U.K. related to Hurco Europe Ltd. (“HEL”), our sales and service business unit located there. Changes resulting from Brexit,  the December 2020 Brexit Deal, and/or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements could subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. We have evaluated the impact of Brexit on us, our subsidiaries, including HEL, our business, and our future operations, operating results, and cash flows and it has not materially change our business to date.​In addition, we do not know if the U.K. and E.U. will succeed in negotiating all material terms not otherwise addressed or covered by the December 2020 Brexit Deal or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements and/or if previously agreed upon items will be renegotiated in the future. Changes in these or other terms resulting from Brexit could, similarly, subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing.​Brexit may also cause fluctuations in the value of the Pound Sterling and the Euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to some of our foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, our hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts.​24​Operational and Strategic Risks​Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements, and competitors’ product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all.  If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.​Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property.  We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Finally, certain subcontractors, vendors, and third parties provide inputs, components, code, and/or similar items that are complimentary and compatible with our products, software, and controls. If we are unable to secure access and/or rights to any such inputs, components, code, or similar items, our ability to continue to produce our products without interruption could be challenged, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, and demand for our products.​25​Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We depend on our wholly owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively.  We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especially steel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.  Recent inflationary pressures and other factors have resulted in increases to the cost of the inputs or materials for our products. Similarly, recently, costs associated with transportation and freight services have increased significantly due limited capacity and/or availability of containers, shipping vessels, and/or receiving port services. If prolonged, and if they cannot be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, these fluctuations in the price of raw materials, product components, and/or transportation services could adversely affect our sales, costs, margin, and profitability.​The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.​Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.We may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:​●difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest;●diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;●potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;26​●difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;●initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;●insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and●the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. ​Acquisitions may also cause us to:●issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;●borrow and subject us to increasing interest rates;●assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company;●record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;●incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;●incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and●become subject to litigation.​For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash impairment charge on goodwill arising from prior acquisitions.  The goodwill impairment charge was attributable primarily to the prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.​Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business.​Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” ​​27​Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which gives California residents certain privacy rights in the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. Additionally, effective starting January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) will revise and significantly expand the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA also creates a new California data protection agency authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA, which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the U.K. and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue under the E.U. GDPR and up to the greater of 17.5 million Pounds or 4% of annual global turnover under the U.K. GDPR). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering and, in some cases, have enacted, similar privacy and data security laws.​The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.​28​If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’ or vendors’ data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.​Like other public, multi-national corporations, we have and/or will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, wire fraud or other cyber incidents. Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supporting the security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant.​Financial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks​Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.​29​Assets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangible assets, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge arising from prior acquisitions, and we may be required to record impairment charges on other assets in the future.​We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. In December 2017, the U.S. passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.​Other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.​​​30​"
5,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2021-01-08,"​ ​RISK FACTORS​In this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business.  The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. ​Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our facilities, customers, and suppliers are located have imposed mandatory closures, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people, goods, and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns.​The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business. Specifically, many of our sales and service organizations throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific have, at one time or another, been subject to temporary closures or otherwise been required to adopt remote work strategies. And, we may continue to experience additional temporary facility closures in response to government mandates and/or the incidence of additional contagion spread.​Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers’ purchasing behavior or decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our products, which could continue for an extended period of time. Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.Significant increases in economic and demand uncertainty have led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both our company and our customers and suppliers. In addition, resulting changes in our access to or cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors could cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but such impact has been, and could continue to be, material.​Risks Related to Our Industry and International Operations​The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve.  As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.​Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely affect overall demand.We typically sell the majority of our larger, high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.  Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition.​16Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.During fiscal 2020, approximately 61% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas.  In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S.  Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:●trade barriers;●regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies;●differing labor regulation;●governmental expropriation;●domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;●current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;●difficulty in obtaining distribution support;●difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;●differences in the availability and terms of financing;●political instability and unrest;●negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs;●foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;●changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and●changes in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries.​Quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all.  Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.  These factors may adversely affect our future operating results.  The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China.  Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.​Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.Our sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 61% of our revenues in fiscal 2020, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro.  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in 17foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure.  There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.  ​We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, most of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.​The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) withdrew from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. and E.U. agreed to participate in a transition period (the “Transition Period”), due to expire on December 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade agreement and other aspects of their future relationship. During the Transition Period, free trade has continued and will continue between the U.K. and E.U. without checks or extra charges. Following the Transition Period, the U.K. will no longer be a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. In December 2020, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues (the “December 2020 Brexit Deal”) – potentially avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, “hard” Brexit.​We have operations in the U.K. related to Hurco Europe Ltd. (“HEL”), our sales and service business unit located there. Changes resulting from Brexit and the newly-announced December 2020 Brexit Deal could subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of Brexit and the December 2020 Brexit Deal on us, our subsidiaries, including HEL, our business, and our future operations, operating results, and cash flows. ​In addition, we do not know if the U.K. and E.U. will succeed in negotiating certain terms not addressed or covered by the December 2020 Brexit Deal. Changes in these other terms resulting from Brexit after the Transition Period could, similarly, subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing.​Brexit may cause fluctuations in the value of the U.K. pound sterling and E.U. euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to some of our foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, our hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts.​18Operational and Strategic Risks​Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements, and competitors’ product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all.  If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.​Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property.  We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We depend on our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively.  We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especially steel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.​19The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.​Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.We may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following●difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest;●diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;●potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;●difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;●initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;●insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and●the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. ​Acquisitions may also cause us to:●issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;●assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company;●record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;●incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;●incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and●become subject to litigation.​For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash impairment charge on goodwill arising from prior acquisitions.  The goodwill impairment charge was attributable primarily to the prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.​Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky.

For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” ​20Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. Regulations from the California Attorney General have not been finalized, and it is expected that additional amendments to the CCPA will be introduced in 2020. Meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA, We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.​The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.​If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’ or vendors’ data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.  Like other public, multi-national corporations, we have and/or will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, wire fraud or other cyber incidents. 21Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supporting the security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant. Financial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks​Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.​Assets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge arising from prior acquisitions, and we may be required to record impairment charges on other assets in the future.​We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. In December 2017, the U.S. passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.22 Other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.​An increase in the LIBOR rate or a phase-out or replacement of LIBOR with a benchmark rate that is higher or more volatile than the LIBOR rate could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position.The interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  Any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Further, in July 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  The cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of LIBOR has since been extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration until mid-2023.  In response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) to identify alternatives to LIBOR.  The ARRC has recommended a benchmark replacement procedures to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against LIBOR’s discontinuation.  The initial steps in the ARRC’s recommended provision reference variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR.  At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement.  Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR.  At this time, all of our debt obligations that are based on LIBOR will mature at the end of 2021, but in anticipation of LIBOR’s phase out, the Second Amendment to our [2018 Credit Agreement] provides for alternative benchmark rates (including a hard-wired SOFR-based alternative benchmark) as well as transition mechanisms for selecting another benchmark replacement rate for LIBOR, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the lender.  We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur.  Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.​​"
11,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2020-01-03,"RISK FACTORS In this section, we describe what we believeto be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are notthe only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterialmay also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur,our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Thecyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations andfinancial condition, which could re-occur in the future. Uncertain global economic conditionsmay adversely affect overall demand. We typically sell the majority of our larger,high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European and Asian Pacific markets adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. Our international operations poseadditional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2019, approximately 64% ofour revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the U.S., which includecustomers located in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America. In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are locatedoutside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:  •trade barriers; •regional economic uncertainty; •differing labor regulation; •governmental expropriation; •domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;   •current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials; •difficulty in obtaining distribution support; •difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; •differences in the availability and terms of financing; •political instability and unrest;  •negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs; •foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash; •changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and •changes in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or othertrade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing orproduct development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/orthat we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subjectto laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings toaffiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results.The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to fourports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China. Changes incustoms requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverseimpact on our results of operations. 15  Additionally, we must comply with complexforeign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violationsof these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our businessconduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand,our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although wehave implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurancethat our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. Disruptions in our manufacturingoperations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanicalcomponents and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S. and Italy, respectively. We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL,and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives for ourmachine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers,would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruption or increasein price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a naturaldisaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our informationsystems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange ratesbetween the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our sales to customers located outsideof the Americas, which generated approximately 63% of our revenues in fiscal 2019, are invoiced and received in several foreigncurrencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition areaffected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversionand for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials andcomponents for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge aportion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate theimpact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risksof counterparty failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. Our competitive position and prospectsfor growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are acceptedin the market. The machine tool industry is subjectto technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion ofproduct offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements andcompetitors’ product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that areaccepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects,and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all. If the technologies or standards used in ourproducts become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adverselyaffected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 16  We compete with larger companiesthat have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions. The markets in which our products are soldare extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality,reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., Europeanand Asian competitors, most of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have beensupported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financialresources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive. Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especiallysteel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability.  We manufacture products with a high ironand steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supplyand demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortagesand tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of priceincreases; in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higherprices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Regulations related to “conflictminerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals usedin manufacturing our products.  The SEC requires disclosure by public companiesof specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufacturedor contracted to be manufactured. Securities laws and/or SEC rules require a disclosure report to be filed annually with the SECand require companies to perform due diligence and to disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the DemocraticRepublic of Congo or an adjoining country. Such laws or rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficientquantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of components that are incorporated into our products, including tin, tantalum,gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be materialcosts associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determiningthe source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources ofsupply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevantminerals used in components manufactured by third parties through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation.We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certifiedas conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Due to future changes in technology,changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive. The technology within our products evolves,and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amountof inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changingcustomer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventoryon hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusableinventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 17  Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm ouroperating results. We may seek additional opportunities toexpand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitionsinvolve numerous risks, including the following:    •difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest; •diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business; •potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development; •difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; •initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; •insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;  •the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and •the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. Acquisitions may also cause us to:  • issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership; • assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company; •record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potentialperiodic impairment charges; • incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; •incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and • become subject to litigation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherentlyrisky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisitionwill not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integratean acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developedand marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisitiondue diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Risks related to new product developmentalso apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changesin technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” Assets may become impaired, requiring us to record a significantcharge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangibleassets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingvalue may not be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for theperiod in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. We may experience negative orunforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review theprobability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both theU.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based uponapproved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of avaluation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses inthe period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financialcondition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of fundsrepresenting earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.  18  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. andnumerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S.,may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings incountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in taxlaws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those inthe U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may resultin the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law isenacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. In December 2017, the U.S. passed the TaxCuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition,cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighedby other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvestedearnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, couldhave a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations. Other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictionswhere we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense,could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could ariseas a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerouslong-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect ourprovision for income taxes. Our continued success depends onour ability to protect our intellectual property. Our future success depends, in part, uponour ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements,trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequateto protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition,the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protectour proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to claims that we maybe infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcomeof patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damagesand/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our productsand services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. The unanticipated loss of currentmembers of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results. The unexpected loss of members of our seniormanagement team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future successwill depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior managementor other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentiallylose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. 19  Failure to comply with data privacyand security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted dataprivacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protectionof sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other personal information. For example,several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, andat times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other statelaws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely tookeffect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personalinformation about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that mayaffect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. Regulations from the California AttorneyGeneral have not been finalized, and it is expected that additional amendments to the CCPA will be introduced in 2020. Meanwhile,over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA, We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of thesestate laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance,allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws,including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirementsin these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes,among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyzeand transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities incertain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of upto the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are consideringsimilar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. The interpretation and enforcement of thelaws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implementcompliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulationscould result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigationand/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. If our network and system securitymeasures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’ or vendors’data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.  As part of our business, we storeour data and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third partygained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breachcould expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may bebreached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasanceor otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive informationsuch as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including ourintellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Inaddition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or tosecurity breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, orfrom cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidentialinformation.  20  Like other public, multi-national corporations,we have and/or will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, includingstate-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks,computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, wire fraud or other cyber incidents. Although we work closely with industryrecognized manufacturers supporting the security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with theongoing threats, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequentand adaptive, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Anysecurity breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorizedrelease of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation;a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, thecost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant. 21   "
3,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2019-01-04,"           RISKFACTORS In this section we describe what we believeto be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are notthe only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterialmay also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur,our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Thecyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations andfinancial condition, which could re–occur in the future. Uncertain global economic conditionsmay adversely affect overall demand.We typically sell the majority of our largerhigh–performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European and Asian Pacific markets adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. Our international operations poseadditional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.During fiscal 2018, approximately 71% ofour revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the U.S. In addition, our main manufacturing facilities arelocated outside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: •trade barriers; •regional economic uncertainty; •differing labor regulation; •governmental expropriation; •domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;•current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials; •difficulty in obtaining distribution support; •difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; •differences in the availability and terms of financing; •political instability and unrest;  •negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti–dumping duties or similar tariffs; •changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and •changes in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barrierscould require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdrawfrom or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, wemay be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earningsto affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results. Thevast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports ofdestination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China. Changes in customs requirements,as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  14   Additionally, we must comply with complexforeign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti–competition regulations. Violationsof these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our businessconduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand,our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although wehave implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurancethat our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. We depend on limited sources forour products.We depend on our wholly–owned subsidiaries,HML, Ningbo Hurco Machine Tool Co., Ltd. (“NHML”), Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro–mechanicalcomponents and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S. and Italy, respectively. We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL,and other key third party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives for ourmachine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers,would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase inprice could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment or a natural disaster, such as trade warsor tariffs, or an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, ifprolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange ratesbetween the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.Our sales to customers located outsideof the U.S., which generated approximately 71% of our revenues in fiscal 2018, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies,primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affectedby fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and forfinancial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and componentsfor our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge a portion ofour foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact ofchanges in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter–partyfailure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. Our competitive position and prospectsfor growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are acceptedin the market.The machine tool industry is subject totechnological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of productofferings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, aresignificant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standardsused in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adverselyaffected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.  15   We compete with larger companies that have greater financialresources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.The markets in which our products are soldare extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality,reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., Europeanand Asian competitors, most of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have beensupported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financialresources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive. Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especiallysteel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability. We manufacture products with a high ironand steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supplyand demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortagesand tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of priceincreases; in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higherprices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Regulations related to “conflictminerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals usedin manufacturing our products. The SEC requires disclosure by public companiesof specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufacturedor contracted to be manufactured. Securities laws and/or SEC rules require a disclosure report to be filed annually with the SECand require companies to perform due diligence and to disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the DemocraticRepublic of Congo or an adjoining country. Such laws or rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficientquantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of components that are incorporated into our products, including tin, tantalum,gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers that provide conflict–free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be materialcosts associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determiningthe source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources ofsupply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevantminerals used in components manufactured by third parties through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation.We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certifiedas conflict–free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Due to future changes in technology,changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.The technology within our products evolves,and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amountof inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changingcustomer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventoryon hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusableinventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm ouroperating results.We may seek additional opportunities toexpand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitionsinvolve numerous risks, including the following:  •difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target’s pre–acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest; •diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business; •potential difficulties completing projects associated with in–process research and development;  16     •difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; •initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; •insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;  •the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and •the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. Acquisitions may also cause us to: •issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership; •assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company; •record goodwill and non–amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; •incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; •incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write–offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and •become subject to litigation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherentlyrisky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisitionwill not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integratean acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developedand marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre–acquisitiondue diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Risks related to new product developmentalso apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changesin technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” Assets may become impaired, requiring us to record a significantcharge to earnings. We review our assets, including intangibleassets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingvalue may not be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for theperiod in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.We may experience negative or unforeseentax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realizationof our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforwardperiods, tax–planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in our profitability and financialoutlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non–cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverseimpact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outsidethe U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective taxrates.  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. andnumerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S.,may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings incountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in taxlaws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those inthe U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may resultin the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law isenacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period.  17   In December 2017, both houses of the U.S.Congress passed legislation that was approved and signed into law. This legislation could have a material benefit or material adverseimpact on our effective tax rate, tax expense and cash flow. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of thispassed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporatetax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additionaltaxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation couldhave a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations. Our continued success depends onour ability to protect our intellectual property.Our future success depends in part uponour ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements,trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequateto protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition,the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protectour proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The unanticipated loss of currentmembers of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.The unexpected loss of members of our seniormanagement team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future successwill depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior managementor other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentiallylose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. If our network and system securitymeasures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’ or vendors’data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities. As part of our business, we store our dataand certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorizedaccess to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks,including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third–partyaction, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third partiesmay attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords orother information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidentialbusiness information, or our information technology systems. Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supportingthe security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques usedto obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniquesor to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidentialbusiness or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a lossof confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negativeimpact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measurescould be significant.  18   "

If any of the developments included in the following risks wereto occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. The cyclicalnature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operationsand financial condition. Uncertain global economicconditions, may adversely affect overall demand. We typically sell the majority of ourlarger high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions inthat region. Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European and Asian Pacific markets adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition. Our international operations pose additionalrisks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2016, approximately 69% of ourrevenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the U.S. In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are locatedoutside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: •trade barriers;•regional economic uncertainty;•differing labor regulation;•governmental expropriation;•domestic and foreign customs                                         and tariffs;•current and changing regulatory                                         environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;•difficulty in obtaining distribution                                         support;•difficulty in staffing and                                         managing widespread operations;•differences in the availability                                         and terms of financing;•political instability and                                         unrest;•changes in tax regulations                                         and rates in foreign countries; and•changes in the European Union                                         and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally                                         and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange                                         markets, as well as disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barrierscould require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdrawfrom or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions,we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remitearnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operatingresults. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung tofour ports of destination: Los Angeles, California, Tacoma, Washington, Venlo, the Netherlands, and Shanghai, China. Changes incustoms requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impacton our results of operations.  13   Additionally, we must comply with complexforeign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreignlaws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulationscould result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer ourproducts in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, ourinternational operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designedto ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents inforeign countries will not violate our policies. We depend on limited sources for ourproducts. We depend on our wholly-owned subsidiaries,Hurco Manufacturing Limited, Ningbo Hurco Manufacturing Limited, Milltronics USA, Inc., and LCM Precision Technology S.r.l., toproduce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S. and Italy, respectively.We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third party suppliers to produce our computer control systemsand key components, such as motors and drives for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing would have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruption could result from a change in the politicalenvironment or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Also, any interruption in service by one of ourkey component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange rates betweenthe U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our sales to customers located outside ofthe U.S., which generated approximately 69% of our revenues in fiscal 2016, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies,primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affectedby fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and forfinancial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and componentsfor our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge our foreigncurrency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes inforeign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. Therecan be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. Our competitive position and prospectsfor growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are acceptedin the market. The machine tool industry is subject to technologicalchange, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Ourability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’ productofferings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significantfactors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standards used in ourproducts become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.Although we believe that we have the technological capabilities to remain competitive, developments by others may render our productsor technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.  14   We compete with larger companies thathave greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions. The markets in which our products are soldare extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality,reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., Europeanand Asian competitors, most of which are larger, have substantially greater financial resources and have been supported by governmentalor financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. While we believe our product linescompete effectively, our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging toremain competitive. Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especially steeland iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability.  We manufacture products with a high iron andsteel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supplyand demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs and anticipated or perceived shortages.In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases they cannot.If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results ofoperations would be adversely affected. Regulations related to “conflictminerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals usedin manufacturing our products.  The SEC requires disclosure by public companiesof specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufacturedor contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires a disclosure report to be filed annually with the SEC, and requires companiesto perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo oran adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certainminerals used in the manufacture of components that are incorporated into our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten.The number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associatedwith complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the sourceof certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply asa consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant mineralsused in components manufactured by third parties through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation. We may alsoencounter challenges to satisfy those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free,which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Due to future changes in technology,changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive. The technology within our productsevolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involvesestimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair partneeds. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have eitherobsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, wemight have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operatingresults. In July 2015, we acquired a CNC machine toolbusiness in Minnesota, U.S. (Milltronics) and a CNC machine tool business in Taiwan (Takumi). We may seek additional opportunitiesto expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  15   •difficulties integrating the                                         operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company;•diversion of management’s                                         attention from normal daily operations of the business;•potential difficulties completing                                         projects associated with in-process research and development;•difficulties entering markets                                         in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such                                         markets have stronger market positions;•initial dependence on unfamiliar                                         supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•insufficient revenues to offset                                         increased expenses associated with acquisitions;•the potential loss of key                                         employees of the acquired companies; and•potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. Acquisitions may also cause us to: •issue common stock that would                                         dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;•assume liabilities of an acquired                                         company;•record goodwill and non-amortizable                                         intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential                                         periodic impairment charges;•incur amortization expenses                                         related to certain intangible assets;•incur large acquisition and                                         integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses;                                         and•become subject to litigation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky.No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition willnot adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate anacquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developedand marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisitiondue diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. Risks related to new product development alsoapply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changes intechnology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.” Assets may become impaired, requiring us to record a significantcharge to earnings.  We review our assets, including intangibleassets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value maynot be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the periodin which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. We may experience negative orunforeseen tax consequences.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each periodbased on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results,projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planningopportunities and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S.or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Suchchanges could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a materialadverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operatingincome from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantlyimpact our effective tax rates.  In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantlyimpact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on domestic and foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether orin what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material benefit or adverse impact on our taxexpense and cash flow.  16   Our continued success depends on ourability to protect our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part upon ourability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements,trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequateto protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition,the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protectour proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The unanticipated loss of current membersof our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results. The unexpected loss of members of our seniormanagement team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future successwill depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior managementor other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentiallylose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. If our network and system security measuresare breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our customers’ or vendors’ data, or to our criticalinformation technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.  As part of our business, we store our dataand certain data about our customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gainedunauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us torisks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-partyaction, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third partiesmay attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwordsor other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidentialbusiness information, or our information technology systems. Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supportingthe security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques usedto obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniquesor to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidentialbusiness or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidenceby our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impacton our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measurescould be significant.  17   "
9,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2016-01-08,"	RISK FACTORS In this section we describe what we believeto be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report arenot the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deemimmaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks wereto occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Thecyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operationsand financial condition. Uncertain economic conditions, particularlyin Europe, may adversely affect overall demand. We typically sell the majority of ourlarger high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in thatregion. Therefore, economic uncertainty and business downturns in the European market adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. Our international operations poseadditional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2015, approximately 68%of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside North America. In addition, our main manufacturing facilitiesare located outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:  •trade    barriers; •regional    economic uncertainty; •differing    labor regulation; •governmental    expropriation;  12    •domestic    and foreign customs and tariffs;  •current    and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials; •difficulty    in obtaining distribution support; •difficulty    in staffing and managing widespread operations; •differences    in the availability and terms of financing; •political    instability and unrest; and •changes    in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other tradebarriers could require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development,withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions,we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remitearnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operatingresults. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung tofour ports of destination: Los Angeles, California, Tacoma, Washington, Venlo, the Netherlands, and Shanghai, China. Changes incustoms requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impacton our results of operations. Additionally, we must comply with complexforeign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreignlaws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulationscould result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer ourproducts in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, ourinternational operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designedto ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents inforeign countries will not violate our policies. We depend on limited sources forour products. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hurco ManufacturingLimited, Ningbo Hurco Manufacturing Limited, Milltronics USA, Inc., and LCM Precision Technology S.r.l., produce our machine toolsand electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S. and Italy, respectively. An unplanned interruptionin manufacturing would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruptioncould result from a change in the political environment or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Anyinterruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, also could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange ratesbetween the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our foreign sales, which generate approximately68% of our revenues, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan.Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currenciesand the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposedto exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which areprimarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar. We hedge our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts.These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the relatedcontract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.  13   Our competitive position and prospectsfor growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are acceptedin the market. The machine tool industry is subject totechnological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of productofferings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, aresignificant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standardsused in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adverselyaffected.

The phasing out of an old productinvolves estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repairpart needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have eitherobsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we mighthave to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm ouroperating results. In July 2015, we acquired a CNC machinetool business in Minnesota, USA. (Milltronics) and a CNC machine tool business in Taiwan (Takumi). In July 2013, we also acquireda machine tool component business in Italy (LCM). We may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or themarkets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,including the following:  •difficulties    integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company;•diversion    of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business; •potential    difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development; •difficulties    entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger    market positions; •initial    dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; •insufficient    revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and •the    potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. Acquisitions may also cause us to:  •issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership; •assume liabilities of an acquired company; •record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; •incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; •incur large and immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and •become subject to litigation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherentlyrisky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful.

10,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2015-01-09,"	RISK FACTORS In this section we describe what we believeto be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are notthe only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterialmay also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur,our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Thecyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations andfinancial condition. Uncertain economic conditions, particularlyin Europe, may adversely affect overall demand. We typically sell the majority of our largerhigh-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region.Therefore, economic uncertainty and business downturns in the European market adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. Our international operations poseadditional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2014, approximately 72% ofour revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside the United States. In addition, our manufacturing facilitiesare located outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: ·trade barriers;·regional economic uncertainty;·differing labor regulation;·governmental expropriation;·domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;·current and changing regulatory environmentsaffecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;·difficulty in obtaining distribution support;·difficulty in staffing and managing widespreadoperations;·differences in the availability and termsof financing;·political instability and unrest; and·changes in tax regulations and rates inforeign countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barrierscould require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdrawfrom or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, wemay be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earningsto affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results. Thevast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to three ports ofdestination: Los Angeles, California, Venlo, the Netherlands, and Shanghai, China. Changes in customs requirements, as a resultof national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 10  Additionally, we must comply with complexforeign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreignlaws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulationscould result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our productsin one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our internationaloperations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliancewith these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents in foreign countries willnot violate our policies. We depend on limited sources forour products. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hurco ManufacturingLimited, Ningbo Hurco Manufacturing Limited and LCM Precision Technology S.r.l., produce our machine tools and electro-mechanicalcomponents and accessories in Taiwan, China and Italy, respectively. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing would have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruption could result from a change in the politicalenvironment or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Any interruption in service by one of our key componentsuppliers, if prolonged, also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange ratesbetween the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our foreign sales, which generate approximately72% of our revenues, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan.Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currenciesand the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed toexchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarilymade in the New Taiwan Dollar. We hedge our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedgecontracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract periodand carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. Our competitive position and prospectsfor growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are acceptedin the market. The machine tool industry is subject totechnological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of productofferings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, aresignificant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standardsused in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adverselyaffected. Although we believe that we have the technological capabilities to remain competitive, developments by others may renderour products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We compete with larger companiesthat have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions. The markets in which our products are soldare extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality,reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., Europeanand Asian competitors, most of which are larger, have substantially greater financial resources and have been supported by governmentalor financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. While we believe our product linescompete effectively, our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging toremain competitive. 11  Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especiallysteel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability. We manufacture products with a high ironand steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supplyand demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs and anticipated or perceived shortages.In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases they cannot. Ifthe prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operationswould be adversely affected. Regulations related to “conflictminerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals usedin manufacturing our products. The SEC requires disclosure by public companiesof specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufacturedor contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires a disclosure report to be filed annually with the SEC, beginning in 2014, andrequires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republicof Congo or an adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantitiesof certain minerals used in the manufacture of components that are incorporated into our products, including tin, tantalum, goldand tungsten. The number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costsassociated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining thesource of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supplyas a consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant mineralsused in components manufactured by third parties through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certifiedas conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Due to future changes in technology,changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excess. The technology within our products changesand, generally, we bring new versions of our machines to market in three-year to five-year cycles. The phasing out of an old productinvolves estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repairpart needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have eitherobsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we mighthave to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm ouroperating results. In 2013, we acquired a machine tool componentbusiness in Italy (namely, LCM) and we may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serveby acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  ·difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company; ·diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business; ·potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development; ·difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; 12   ·initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; ·insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and ·the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. Acquisitions may also cause us to: ·issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’percentage ownership;·assume liabilities of an acquired company;·record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will besubject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;·incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;·incur large and immediate write-offs, and restructuring and otherrelated expenses; and·become subject to litigation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherentlyrisky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisitionwill not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integratean acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developedand marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisitiondue diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in marketdemand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excess.” Assets may become impaired, requiringus to record a significant charge to earnings. We review our assets, including intangibleassets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value maynot be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the periodin which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. We may experience negative or unforeseentax consequences. We may experience negative or unforeseentax consequences.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecastsof taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operatingresults based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuationallowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period inwhich the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our continued success depends onour ability to protect our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part uponour ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements,trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequateto protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition,the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protectour proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13  The unanticipated loss of currentmembers of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results. The unexpected loss of members of our seniormanagement team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future successwill depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior managementor other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentiallylose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. If our network and system securitymeasures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, our customers’ or vendors’ data, or to our criticalinformation technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities. As part of our business, we store our dataand certain data about our customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorizedaccess to our data, including any data regarding our customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, includingloss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action,including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties mayattempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or otherinformation to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential businessinformation, or our information technology systems. Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supportingthe security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques usedto obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniquesor to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidentialbusiness or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidenceby our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impacton our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measurescould be significant. 14  "

The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report arenot the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deemimmaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks wereto occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. The cyclical nature of ourbusiness causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclicaland changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experiencedsignificant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operationsand financial condition. 9  Uncertain economic conditions, particularlyin Europe, may adversely affect overall demand. We typically sell the majority of ourlarger high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in thatregion. Therefore, economic uncertainty and business downturns in the European market adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. Our international operations pose additional risks thatmay adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2013, approximately 68%of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside the United States. In addition, our manufacturing facilitiesare located outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: ·trade                                         barriers;·regional                                         economic uncertainty;·differing                                         labor regulation;·governmental                                         expropriation;·domestic                                         and foreign customs and tariffs;·current                                         and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products                                         and raw materials;·difficulty                                         in obtaining distribution support;·difficulty                                         in staffing and managing widespread operations;·differences                                         in the availability and terms of financing;·political                                         instability and unrest; and·changes                                         in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other tradebarriers could require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development,withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions,we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remitearnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met.

The ongoing economicuncertainty in the European market could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our international operations pose additional risks thatmay adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal 2012, approximately 70%of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside the United States. In addition, our manufacturing facilitiesare located outside of the United States.

change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development,withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions,we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remitearnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operatingresults. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung totwo ports of destination: Los Angeles, California, and Venlo, the Netherlands. Changes in customs requirements, as a result ofnational security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We depend on limited sources for our products. Our wholly owned subsidiaries in Taiwanand China, Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (HML) and Ningbo Hurco Manufacturing Limited (NHML), produce all of our machine tools. Anunplanned interruption in manufacturing would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Such an interruption could result from a change in the political environment or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon,or tsunami. Any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, also could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the exchange ratesbetween the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our foreign sales, which generateapproximately 70% of our revenues, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, PoundSterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations inexchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financialreporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and componentsfor our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar. We hedge our foreign currencyexposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes inforeign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure.There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. Our competitive position and prospects for growth maybe diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market. The machine tool industry is subject totechnological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of productofferings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, aresignificant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standardsused in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adverselyaffected. Although we believe that we have the technological capabilities to remain competitive, developments by others may renderour products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 9  We compete with larger companies that have greater financialresources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions. The markets in which our products aresold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in termsof quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S.,European and Asian competitors, most of which are larger, have substantially greater financial resources and have been supportedby governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. While we believe ourproduct lines compete effectively, our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making itchallenging to remain competitive.  Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especiallysteel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability.  We manufacture products with a high ironand steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supplyand demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs and anticipated or perceived shortages.In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases they cannot.If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results ofoperations would be adversely affected. Due to future changes in technology, changes in marketdemand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excess. The technology within ourproducts changes and, generally, we bring new versions of our machines to market in three-year to five-year cycles.The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for thosemachines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times forrepair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes intechnology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect ourresults of operations. We may make acquisitions that could disrupt our operationsand harm our operating results. We may seek to expand our product offeringsor the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.

acquisitions are inherentlyrisky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that acquisitionswill not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrateacquisitions could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developedand marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisitiondue diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. Risks related to new product developmentalso apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changesin technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excess.” Assets may become impaired, requiring us to record asignificant charge to earnings.  We review our assets for indications ofimpairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We could be required torecord a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets isdetermined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. We may experience negative or unforeseentax consequences.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecastsof taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operatingresults based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of avaluation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in theperiod in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our continued success depends on our ability to protectour intellectual property. Our future success depends in part uponour ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements,trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequateto protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition,the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protectour proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The unanticipated loss of current members of our seniormanagement team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results. The unexpected loss of members of oursenior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that ourfuture success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The lossof senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replacethe departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. 11  "
6,HURC,HURCO COMPANIES INC,2009-01-12,"    RISKFACTORSIn thissection we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to ourbusiness.  The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere inthis report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks anduncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial mayalso adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developmentsincluded in the following risks were to occur, our business, financialcondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materiallyadversely affected.The currentglobal economic crisis is adversely affecting overall demand and our customers’ability to purchase our products and services.Thecurrent global economic crisis has severely impacted banks and other lenders,limiting the ability of many businesses to access the creditmarkets.  As a result of the credit crisis and the overall decline ineconomic activity, the ability of our customers to purchase our products andservices has been adversely affected, the initial impact of which was reflectedin our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  An overalldecline in economic activity may also have an adverse affect on our customersand distributors ability to pay us for the products they purchased.  Aprolonged recession or further decline in the global economy will materiallyadversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  For additional information regarding current economicconditions and their impact on our results of operations and financialcondition, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations. 8Thecyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operatingresults.Themachine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occurabruptly in the geographic markets we serve.  As a result of thiscyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which,in periods of reduced demand have adversely affected our results of operationsand financial condition.Ourinternational operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact salesand earnings.Duringthe fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, more than 75% of our revenues werederived from sales to customers located outside the United States.  Wealso have manufacturing facilities and assets located outside of the UnitedStates.  These international operations are subject to a number ofrisks, including:       ·trade      barriers       ·regional      economic uncertainty       ·differing      labor regulation       ·risk      of governmental expropriation       ·domestic      and foreign customs and tariffs       ·current      and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and      exportation of products and rawmaterials       ·difficulty      in obtaining distribution support       ·difficulty      in staffing and managing widespreadoperations       ·differences      in the availability and terms offinancing       ·political      instability and unrest       ·risks      of changes in taxes       ·tax      implications from repatriation offundsQuotas,tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers could require us to change manufacturingsources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development,withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that couldbe adverse to us.  Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may besubject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized oroperating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companiesunless specified conditions are met.  These factors may adverselyaffect our future operating results.  All of our products are shippedfrom our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to threeports of destination: Los Angeles, California, Venlo, the Netherlands, andSingapore.  Changes in customs requirements, as a result of nationalsecurity or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverseimpact on our results of operations.Wedepend on limited sources for our products.Ourwholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan, Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (HML), produces allof our machine tools.  Any interruption in manufacturing at HML wouldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.  Interruption in manufacturing at HML could result from achange in the political environment in Taiwan or a natural disaster, such as anearthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Any interruption with one of our key componentsuppliers may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsand financial condition. 9 Fluctuationsin the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreigncurrencies can increase our costs or decrease our revenues.Ourinternational sales divisions generate more than 75% of our revenues, which arereceived in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Pound Sterling.Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected byfluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar,both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. Inaddition, payments for components incorporated into our products are made in theNew Taiwan Dollar.  We hedge our foreign currency exposure with thepurchase of forward exchange contracts. Hedge contracts only mitigate the impactof changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the relatedhedge contract period.  Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements for the impact of translation of foreigncurrencies and hedging on the consolidated financial statements.Ourcompetitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unableto develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that areaccepted in the market.Themachine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industrystandards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion ofproduct offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industrystandards, customers’ requirements and competitors’ product offerings and todevelop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that areaccepted in the market, will be significant factors in maintaining and improvingour competitive position and growth prospects.  If the technologies orstandards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespreadcommercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.Although we believe that we have the technological capabilities to remaincompetitive, developments by others may render our products or technologiesobsolete or noncompetitive.Wecompete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and ourbusiness could be harmed by competitors’ actions.Themarkets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highlyfragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers interms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service andtechnological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European andAsian competitors, most of which are larger, have substantially greaterfinancial resources and are supported by governmental or financial institutionsubsidies. While we believe our product lines compete effectively, our financialresources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making itchallenging to remain competitive. Fluctuationof the price of raw materials, especially steel and iron, could adversely affectour sales, costs and profitability.Wemanufacture products with a high iron and steel content for which worldwideprices can change significantly. The availability and price for these and otherraw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demandforces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costsand anticipated or perceived shortages. In some cases, those cost increases canbe passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases theycannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to chargeour customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our resultsof operations.Dueto future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in marketexpectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete orexcess.Thetechnology within our products changes and generally new versions of machinesare brought to market in three to five year cycles. The phasing out of an oldproduct involves estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the finaldemand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based onchanging customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, wemay find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because ofunforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we mighthave to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our resultsof operations. 10 Wemay make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operatingresults.Althoughwe are not currently engaged in negotiations, and have no current plans for anyacquisitions, we may seek to expand our product offerings or the markets weserve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies andpersonnel.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including thefollowing:       ·difficulties      integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of the      acquired companies       ·diversion      of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the      business       ·potential      difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and      development       ·difficulties      entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience,      especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market      positions       ·initial      dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply      partners       ·insufficient      revenues to offset increased expenses associated with      acquisitions       ·the      potential loss of key employees of the acquired  companiesAcquisitionsmay also cause us to:       ·issue      common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage      ownership       ·assume      liabilities       ·record      goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to      impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment      charges       ·incur      amortization expenses related to certain intangible  assets       ·incur      large and immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related      expenses       ·become      subject to litigationMergersand acquisitions are inherently risky.
