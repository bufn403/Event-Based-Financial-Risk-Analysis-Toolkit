12,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2024-04-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth in this Report and the other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),including the Company’s financial statements and related notes, in evaluating the Company’s business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on the Company’s operations and business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently considers immaterial, may also impair its business or operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company’s business and financial condition, results or prospects could be harmed. Please also read carefully the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. If any of the events or developments described below occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In that case, the value of our common stock may decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Risk Factors
 SummaryOur business and an investment in our common stock are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this “Risk Factors
” section below. Some of these risks include:Risks related to our Financial Condition•We have doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.13 •We have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flow and our operating results may significantly vary from quarter-to-quarter, so we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.•Because we require consents to obtain new financings, we may not be able to pursue these transactions if we cannot obtain the consents.•As a result of our outstanding convertible notes and related warrants, our stockholders are subject to significant future dilution.Economic, Policy and Business Risks•A large percentage of our current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in government funding or a change in government spending priorities or bidding processes could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•If our reputation or relationships with the governments of the U.S., the UK or Israel or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected. •Because we engage in fixed fee contracts with our customers, we face pressure on our gross profit margins and operating costs from inflation.•The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in Israel and tensions elsewhere in the world on the capital markets and the economy is uncertain, and we may have to deal with a recessionary economy and economic uncertainty including possible adverse effects upon the capital markets.•We must replace the former Chief Executive Officer of Gresham Power and hire a new Chief Financial Officer for Enertec.•If the inflationary pressures in the US. and elsewhere where we operate continue, we could experience reduced margins and lose future business.Sales, Business Development and Competitive Risks•Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly. •Our sales are significantly dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers.•We face intense industry competition and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could increase our losses.•If we are unable to monetize our legacy Giga-tronics business, we may be required to discontinue its business.Performance and Operational Risks•If we are unable to identify, attract, train and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to effectively execute our business strategy.•Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation.•Supply chain disruptions and our inability to procure necessary component parts for our products have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the future.•We may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase too much inventory.•We depend on a limited number of major customers for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of any of these customers, or the substantial reduction in the quantity of products that they purchase from us, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Risks Related to our Foreign Operations•Because we have a material subsidiary that operates in Israel, the war which began October 7, 2023 may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.•Many of Enertec’s employees are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel, which could have a disruptive impact on our business.•We depend on international sales for a material portion of our revenue.14 •A material portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies, so fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Regulatory and Compliance Risks•Our businesses are subject to government procurement laws and regulations.•If we fail to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.•If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover additional material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock•Because of limited volume of our common stock, you may not be able to sell many shares without depressing the price.•Our stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.•The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential additional issuance of preferred stock.•Because our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, it is more difficult to buy our shares. •We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Risks Related to our Financial ConditionWe have doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.We believe that there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we have incurred recurring net losses and we have not been able to procure funding for our negative cashflows. Convertible notes issued to two lenders mature in October 2024 and convertible notes issued to AAI mature in January 2025. Our inability to continue as a going concern could have a negative impact on the Company, including our ability to obtain needed financing, and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.We have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flow and our operating results may significantly vary from quarter-to-quarter, so we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Gresham reported revenue of $38.0 million and $30.3 and net losses of $15.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop and market our products and services and we could continue to incur losses and negative operating cash flow in the near future. As the result of our lack of working capital, we face a number of challenges:•We have been unable to make installment payments to an investment banker we hired to re-finance our indebtedness. As a result, this party will not provide any further services;•Other service providers have not been paid and have cut back or no longer provide services; •We owe senior management $112,000 in back salaries and $11,000 on credit cards; and•We owe our Chief Financial Officer $50,000 due to our inability to repay interim the loan he made last year. We also owe our Audit Committee Chairman $74,500 in accrued fees which AAI has agreed to pay over time. In addition, our operating results have in the past been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may increase in magnitude, in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding for our products in our customers’ budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenue, and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenue in any future period. In addition, the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable, have been difficult for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results for such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. Finally, supply chain issues have in the past and may in the future affect future quarters.We will need additional capital to fund our operations, and our inability to generate or obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.15 We will need to raise additional capital to pay our indebtedness and to support our working capital requirements and our planned growth. Any other future financing may include shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, units consisting of the foregoing securities, equity investments from strategic development partners or some combination of the foregoing. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail our operations and take additional measures to reduce costs, including reducing our workforce and eliminating outside consultants in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. This could in its turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and future prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any future financing. Because we require consents to obtain new financings, we may not be able to pursue these transactions if we cannot obtain the consents.We issued AAI Series F preferred stock and common stock upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The term of the Series F contains negative covenants that apply such as incurring indebtedness of $1,000,000 in any individual transaction or $2,500,000 in the aggregate, or acquiring any business in which the aggregate consideration payable by us is $1 million or more. In addition, if we issue further equity, subject to exceptions for certain excluded securities, such limited issuances pursuant to equity incentive plans, AAI will have the right to purchase additional equity to maintain its ownership interest. Even if AAI fully converts the Series F into shares of our common stock, the Convertible Notes that we issued in connection with the AAI Financing and the transaction documents that we entered into in connection with our January 2023 sale of Senior Secured Convertible Notes with the two investment funds contain substantially similar covenants that are included in the Series F. These provisions could limit our ability to raise capital or make future acquisitions, particularly larger acquisitions. For more information about these negative covenants, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources – Our Financings.”As a result of our outstanding convertible notes and related warrants, our stockholders are subject to significant future dilution.As of April 8, 2024 we had $18.2 million in outstanding indebtedness evidenced by convertible notes which are convertible into 72.9 million shares of our common stock, subject to possible increases, and 2 million warrants exercisable for nominal consideration. Because of our cash needs, we will have to engage in a new financing or modify of our existing financings. Any new financing or modification may be even further dilutive to our stockholders. Further, the convertible notes have price protection so if we enter into a new financing with a lower conversion or exercise price, those instruments will automatically be adjusted resulting in further dilution. Economic, Policy and Business RisksA large percentage of our current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in government funding or a change in government spending priorities or bidding processes could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The defense programs may compete with other policy needs, which may be viewed as more necessary. For example, budget and appropriations decisions made by the governments of the U.S, the UK and Israel are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for its business. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, and the purchase of our products could be superseded by alternate arrangements. The current prolonged delay in providing new aid to Ukraine and Israel are evidence of the political uncertainties. While defense budgets in countries around the world have generally increased, there can be no assurance that such increases will continue for the foreseeable future. A change in government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total defense spending, could have material adverse consequences on our future business.If our reputation or relationships with the governments of the U.S., the UK or Israel or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected. Gresham derives most of its revenue from the governments of the U.S., the UK and Israel as well defense contractors across the world that supply those countries and their allies. Our reputation and relationships with various government entities and agencies, in particular with the U.S. DOD and Ministries of Defense in the UK and Israel, and the limited number of defense contractors serving these agencies, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Because we engage in fixed fee contracts with our customers, we face pressure on our gross profit margins and operating costs from inflation.Our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively impacted by increased levels of inflation. We are not able to predict the timing and effect of inflation, or its duration and severity. Inflation may cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and reduce our gross profit margins. Also inflation tends to increase our compensation and other costs. Because of the fixed price contracts we enter into,we may not be able to sell our products to our customers at correspondingly increased prices to cover the impact of inflation, resulting in decreased profit margins.We may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time. 16 We remain subject to certain past, current, and future liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments against or affecting us, including the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there may be liabilities of ours that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future, including indemnification requests received from our customers relating to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights, tax liabilities arising in connection with ongoing or future tax audits and liabilities in connection with other past, current and future legal claims and litigation. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may learn additional information that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted, or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights.The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in Israel and tensions elsewhere in the world on the capital markets and the economy is uncertain, and we may have to deal with a recessionary economy and economic uncertainty including possible adverse effects upon the capital markets.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in Israel and tensions with China and Iran have created increased uncertainty in the capital markets and caused in part increased inflation. This may make it more difficult for us to raise capital and the result may be more expense and dilution. We cannot predict how these factors will affect the capital markets, but the impact may be adverse and may delay or prevent us from completing future financings or make any financings.If the inflationary pressures in the U.S. and elsewhere where we operate continue, we could experience reduced margins and lose future business.While the inflation rate is lower than it had been, the current inflationary pressures are affecting our gross profit margins particularly since we have lacked the capital to accumulate material inventory. Most of our contracts (except with Relec) are fixed price, which reduces our margins when inflation occurs. Reducing our selling prices results in further reduction of our margins. This customer pricing pressure may also result in the loss of contracts and/or future business. Finally, we are experiencing rising labor and other costs which may further increase our losses.If we lose key personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.Our success will depend on the continued contributions of key officers and employees. The loss of the services of key officers and employees, whether such loss is through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In November 2023, our Chief Operating Officer retired. He was a key employee, and he is not being replaced as his duties have been assumed by our Chief Technology Officer. While we believe the replacement of Enertec’s former Chief Executive Officer by its Chief Operating Officer will not have a material adverse effect, it is possible that our expectations will be proved to be incorrect. Further, Gresham Power’s Chief Executive Officer passed away in March 2024. With Gresham Power, the loss of Ms. Karen Jay must be viewed against its declining business. We are uncertain whether we will be able to replace her.Our success will depend on the continued contributions of key officers and employees. The loss of the services of key officers and employees, whether such loss is through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In November 2023, our Chief Operating Officer retired. He was a key employee, and he is not being replaced as his duties have been assumed by our Chief Technology Officer. The loss of Zvika Avni, Enertec’s Chief executive Officer, due to illness who managed our Israeli operations in the past, could also materially harm our business.We do not know if the loss of key employees will result in any adverse effects. However, if we were to lose Jonathan Read, Robin Shaffer, Sean Lyle and/or Lutz Henckels, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Development Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively, or Nissim Ovadia, Enertec’s Chief Executive Officer, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Our sales and profitability may be affected by changes in economic, business and industry conditions.If the economic climate in the U.S. or abroad deteriorates, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their orders. In this regard, it was reported in February 2024 that the UK, where we have two subsidiaries, has entered a recession. In this environment, our customers may experience financial difficulty, reduce operations and fail to budget or reduce budgets for the purchase of our products. This may lead to longer sales cycles, delays in purchase decisions, payment and collection, and can also result in downward price pressures, causing our sales and profitability to decline. In addition, general economic uncertainty and general declines in capital spending in the defense electronics sector make it difficult to predict changes in the purchasing requirements of our customers and the markets we serve. There are many other factors which could affect our business, including:•Political factors, which result in a reduction of defense expenditures; •The end of the Russian war in Ukraine, the end of the war in Israel, stability in the Middle East or easing of tensions in Asia;•Gas shortages and environmental issues which divert defense expenditures in the UK; •The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies, products and services including artificial intelligence;•New competitors and new forms of competition; 17 •The size and timing of customer orders (for retail distributed physical product); •The size and timing of capital expenditures by our customers; •Adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and suppliers; •Changes in the pricing policies of, or the introduction of, new products and services by us or our competitors;•Changes in the terms of our contracts with our customers or suppliers; •The availability of products and schedule for deliveries from our suppliers; and •Variations in product costs and the mix of products sold. These trends and factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and diminish our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.We have been significantly short of capital needed to acquire parts for manufacture of our products to complete orders. At times, we have not had the cash available to make advance payments for the purchase of parts, and then, as a consequence, we would not receive the parts from our vendors required to finish a customer order. This would then delay the delivery of our products to customers and would also delay recognition of the resulting revenue and the receipt of cash from the customer. There can be no assurance that we will not operate at a loss during the current or future fiscal years.Our future profitability depends upon many factors, including several that are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: •changes in the demand for our products and services;•changes in the timing of desired customer deliveries;•the availability of working capital;•our ability to deliver on new product developments and introductions on a timely basis;•our loss of key customers or contracts; •our ability to hire engineers and other technical personnel; •the introduction of competitive products; •the failure to gain market acceptance of its new and existing products; and •changes in technology which cause some of our products to be obsolete.  Sales, Business Development and Competitive RisksOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly. The timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry, a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts and our ability to timely develop, produce and upgrade our products.Most of our revenues result from a limited number of relatively large orders that we receive from prime defense contractors and government agencies. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints (including constraints imposed by governmental agencies), multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Even if we receive a purchase order from a customer, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed or the fiscal period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. For these reasons, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such unpredictable operating results may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.Our sales are significantly dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers.Most of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace, which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, our sales may be less than projected with a resulting decline in revenues. As a result, our business depends upon continued U.S., Israeli, UK and other countries’ government expenditures on defense systems for which we provide support. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following:18 •Budgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding•A shift in expenditures away from defense programs that we support•U.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government and other potential delays in the appropriations process•Delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices; and•Changes in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities. The UK economy is now in a recession.Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events were to occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We face intense industry competition and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could increase our losses.We operate in an industry that is generally characterized by intense competition. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the same major defense contractors and the government with whom we enter into contracts with and will continue these efforts in the future, and the governments may choose to use other contractors. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth of product line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts, price erosion, and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsaleable inventory that may need to be written off and, therefore, could reduce our profitability. Additionally, as we are seeing with Microsource, the U.S. military’s decision to discontinue ordering certain aircraft where Microsource acts as a supplier, results in our loss of orders.Because our competitors have greater resources, we may not compete effectively. Several of our competitors, including, among others, K&L Microwave, Q Microwave, Amplitech, Qorvo, Northrop Grumman, Textron, Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. We cannot provide assurance that any products developed by these competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.Our products compete and will compete with similar, if not identical, products produced by our competitors. These competitive products could be marketed by well-established, successful companies that possess greater financial, marketing, distribution personnel, and other resources than we do. These companies can implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. They can introduce new products to new markets more rapidly. In certain instances, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to enter a market in direct competition with us, offering attractive marketing tools to encourage the sale of products that compete with our products or present cost features that customers may find attractive.The markets for some of our products (such as our commercial products in the UK) are also subject to specific competitive risks because these markets are highly price sensitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. If they do so again, we may be forced to respond by lowering our prices. This would reduce revenue and increase losses. Failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may also further reduce our revenue and increase our losses.If we are unable to monetize our legacy Giga-tronics Division, we may be required to discontinue its business.During the last two years the EW Test business has generated approximately $1.1 million per year in revenue despite the fact that we have spent over $26.0 million towards its development. We have a very small backlog for our EW test products as of the date of this Report. Accordingly, if we are unable to monetize our EW business, we may be forced to liquidate our remaining inventory and discontinue its operations. The sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers.We depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue. Our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers. In some cases, our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements. If we are unable to satisfy such requirements, or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements, our business could be materially harmed.If we fail to anticipate and adequately respond to rapid technological changes in our industry, including evolving industry-wide standards, in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.19 Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve for our customers. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals for our customers within the original development schedule of our products, then our customers may opt for competitive offerings or we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we can increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve promised delivery date to our customers or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Performance and Operational RisksIf we are unable to identify, attract, train and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to effectively execute our business strategy.Our performance and future success largely depends on its continuing ability to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including its management, sales and marketing, finance and in particular its engineering, design and technical personnel. For example, we currently have a limited number of qualified personnel for the assembling, tuning and testing processes. Members of our technical staff are nearing retirement, and it may be difficult to replace them, given their experience and expertise. To the extent skilled engineering and manufacturing personnel can be beneficially utilized across divisions, the Company will look to do so. In addition, we will need additional staff to drive Microphase’s forecasted growth and to allow Enertec to handle more large orders. Further Entertec’s recruiting efforts are challenged by the war in Israel and the priority of the military. We do not know whether we can expand our workforce as needed. Our engineering, design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. The competition for qualified personnel in the defense industry in the U.S., UK and Israel is intense and constrains our ability to attract qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our key engineering, design and technical personnel, or its inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation.Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that one of our products might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally.Our EW test and training products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes. Our EW test and training systems are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors or performance problems following the sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development and sales efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and the relatively high selling price of our RADAR/EW testing platform.Our EW test and training platform has been a primary product development focus for the legacy Giga-tronics Division for the last several years. Presently, this product has no backlog. However, delays in completing its initial development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our inability to generate material sales. Additionally, the average selling price of our EW test and training system is considerably higher than our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which requires additional internal approvals on the part of the customer and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in the future, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity.Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and disruptions.As a defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and domestic terrorism events. Our information technology networks and 20 related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, which generally face similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular, are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic security breaches believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls and invested in skilled information technology resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and information technology networks and related systems could:•disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore its operations and/or those of certain of its customers; •result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, our proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, our operating companies or their customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and•damage our reputation with its customers and the U.S, the UK and Israel, and the public generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business.We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.Earthquakes and other events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Microsource and our Giga-tronics Division are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters, epidemics, such as COVID-19, and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. In addition, the war in Israel make our Enertec facility vulnerable to rocket attacks and potential invasion because it is located near the Lebanese boundary.We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and success as an overall business.Supply chain disruptions and our inability to procure necessary component parts for our products have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the future.We manufacture some components for our products, but we rely on subcontract manufacturers to supply components for many of our product offerings. Our reliance upon such subcontract manufacturers involves several risks, including reduced control over manufacturing costs, delivery times, reliability and quality of components, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations, and continued inflationary pressures on many of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. On occasion, particularly with more complex video and filter assemblies, we may experience parts availability/shortage issues resulting from lower-than-expected production yields, necessitating faster and unexpected use of components planned for later ordering periods and thus causing shortages. If we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply, or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing capacity, the inability of our subcontract manufacturers to procure raw materials, the loss of key assembly subcontractors, difficulties associated with the transition to our new subcontract manufacturers or other factors, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, and delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments, any of which would materially harm our business.We may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase too much inventory.The defense industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to business cycles. During periods of growth and high demand for our products, we may not have adequate supplies of inventory on hand to satisfy our customers’ needs. Furthermore, during these periods of growth, our suppliers may also experience high demand and, therefore, may not have adequate levels of the components and other materials that we require to build products so that it can meet our customers’ needs. Our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results. We may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components assuming we have available cash resources. Increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers’ end markets. If we purchase too much inventory, we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write-off the inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations. 21 We depend on a limited number of major customers for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of any of these customers, or the substantial reduction in the quantity of products that they purchase from us, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our operating companies typically depend upon a limited number of major customers to generate a significant portion of its revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Enertec derived approximately to 98% and 89%, respectively, of its revenues from two customers. In each of those years, 75% and 45% of Microphase’s revenues came from the same three customers. However, there is no assurance that the customers, which account for the great proportion of sales in our operating companies will continue placing further orders beyond the backlog orders on hand now. Among the factors that affect future orders are:•We have no intellectual property rights beyond trade secrets for the equipment we manufacture; •We are subject to competition from many manufacturers of purpose-built electronics; •We introduce a new upgraded version of the equipment which may not meet the customer’s needs; •Changing technology may make our products less useful to the customer; •The customer may decrease the size of its orders or seek to reduce our selling price at any time; •The customer may elect to use manufacturers other than our operating companies; and If one or more of our major customers reduce or cancel their orders scaling back some of their activities, our revenue would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, reduction or diversions in defense spending may lead to reduced demand for our products, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the financial condition of one or more of our major customers were to deteriorate, or if such customers have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenue would likely result. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.We are experiencing growth in our business with our increase in revenue in 2023 and expected increase this year. This growth will place significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. These systems improvements may require significant capital expenditures and management resources including hiring a full-time comptroller. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to effectively manage our growth and would in its turn have a material adverse impact on our business and future operating results. Our strategic focus on purpose-built electronics solutions and concurrent cost reduction plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete.We devote significant resources to developing and manufacturing designed-in electronics solutions for our customers. Each product typically represents a uniquely tailored solution for a specific customer’s requirements. Failure to meet these customer product requirements or a failure to meet production schedules and/or product quality standards may put us at risk with one or more of these customers. Moreover, changes in market conditions and changes in the needs and requirements of our customers may affect their purchasing decisions. The loss of one or more of our significant custom electronics solution customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, business or financial condition.We have implemented a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs. While we believe that these actions will have a positive impact, they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate. Early in 2024, we implemented a reduction in force and reduction in office space in our U.S. operations. We may be forced to take additional cost-reducing initiatives, including those involving personnel, which may negatively impact our results of operations due to severance and other related costs. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could have long-term adverse effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for its solutions increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could adversely affect our operating results. A significant portion of our contracts are fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a material increase in inflation.We negotiate most of our contracts on a fixed-price basis which allows us to benefit from cost savings but also subject us to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts, because we assume the entire cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Government contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of our replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foresee ability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us. The U.S., the UK and the Israel are experiencing 22 a significant increase in inflation, which could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if we fail to meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Many of our operating companies purchase a significant amount of their components and products outside of the countries in which they operate.With the exception of Microphase, Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division which source all of their components from U.S. suppliers, and Enertec which sources most of its parts in the U.S., we purchase a majority of our components from foreign manufacturers. In addition, we have a substantial majority of our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. These activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including trade barriers and other restrictions, changes in trade policies, governmental regulations, currency exchange fluctuations, reduced protection for intellectual property, war and other military activities, terrorism, changes in social, political, pandemic, or economic conditions, and other disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we are unable to satisfy our customers’ specific product quality, certification or network requirements, our business could be disrupted, and our financial condition could be harmed.Our customers demand that our products meet stringent quality, performance and reliability standards. We have, from time to time, experienced problems in satisfying such standards. Defects or failures have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future, relating to our product quality, performance and reliability. From time-to-time, our customers also require us to implement specific changes to our products to allow these products to operate within their specific network configurations. If we are unable to remedy these failures or defects or if we cannot complete such required product modifications, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, including inventory write-offs, warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our business. Risks Related to our Foreign OperationsBecause we have a material subsidiary that operates in Israel, the war which began October 7, 2023 may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.Enertec, a subsidiary of the Company, is an Israeli corporation which has its offices and engineering and assembly facility located in Karmiel, Israel, which is near the border with Lebanon. Enertec is a material subsidiary and through December 31, 2023, approximately 41% of the Company’s revenues were derived from Enertec.The war in Israel poses significant risks to Enertec including:•If Hezbollah enters the war or continues launching rockets into Israel, it could destroy Enertec’s facility. Enertec has no alternative facility and the cost of locating a new facility and equipping it would effectively cause it to cease operations for at least six months.•Although most of Enertec’s management and engineering and other staff are too old to serve in the military, any war-related injuries to them could result in a material adverse effect on Enertec’s operations;•Even if Enertec is not materially damaged by rockets, Israel has a system of bomb shelters designed to protect its citizens. To the extent Enertec’s employees are required to enter bomb shelters, it will create a material distraction and affect its ability to deliver products.•A prolonged war causing injuries and deaths in Israel could divert Enertec’s staff from their duties to Enertec. Further some employees have had family members killed to date and future deaths and injuries could adversely affect employees’ efforts.•As the war continues, there has been increasing friction between Israel and the U.S. as the U.S. seeks to pressure Israel to enter into a ceasefire. If this were to result in reduced U.S. aid for Israel, it is possible that Enertec’s business could be adversely affected. In addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, since Israel’s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved as these countries are opposed to Israel’s continuing the war. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment. Our commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you 23 that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover its potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.If the war continues, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Many of Enertec’s employees are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel, which could have a disruptive impact on our business.Certain number of Enertec’s officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service. These military service obligations could have a disruptive impact on our business, if hostilities develop in the future, which may adversely affect our business.We depend on international sales for a material portion of our revenue.Sales to customers outside of North America accounted for more than two thirds of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to represent a material portion of our total revenue. International sales are subject to the risks of international business operations as described above, as well as generally longer payment cycles, greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable, and currency restrictions. These risks include the following: •unexpected changes in practices, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, trade disputes, tax laws and treaties, particularly due to economic tensions and trade negotiations or other trade restrictions; •different labor laws and regulations;•exposure to many stringent and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security; •changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; •risks resulting from fluctuations of currency exchange rates; •risks relating to the trade protection regulations and measures in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions;•limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of its operations in other countries; •limited or potentially unfavorable intellectual property protection; and •exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. International sales are also subject to the export laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Further, our subsidiaries in the U K and Israel are subject to local regulation which may increase our costs.Any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.A material portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies, so fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We face foreign exchange risks because a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies. Further, some suppliers to Enertec and Relec require payment in U.S. dollars, which also exposes us to risk. Generally, U.S. dollar strength adversely impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a substantial portion of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar denominated. We also have foreign exchange risk exposure with respect to certain of its assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of its subsidiaries, and its financial results are affected by the re-measurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2023 we had a gain from foreign currency exchange adjustment of $74,000 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 we had a gain from foreign currency exchange adjustment of $45,000. Legal RisksOur limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete, and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us, the results of which could be costly.24 Many of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us. Although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights, trade secret laws and contractual obligations, these protections may not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property, nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. In order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement, we may be required to institute legal proceedings, which would be costly and would divert our resources from the development of our business. If we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products, our future results could be adversely affected.Although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us. In addition, parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products in the U.S. or abroad.We may in the future be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.Competitors may infringe on our patents, trade secrets or the patents of our licensors. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, or we may be required to defend the validity or enforceability of such patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that either one or more of our patents or our licensors’ patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our patents do not cover that technology. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.Interference proceedings filed by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions regarding our patents or patent applications or those of our partners or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may cause us to incur substantial costs and distract the attention of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.Because of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Regulatory and Compliance RisksOur businesses are subject to government procurement laws and regulations.We must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with the government, including the business that we do as a subcontractor to large prime contractors that contract directly with the government. In complying with these laws and regulations, we incur additional costs. These costs may increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future government contracts.Some U.S. federal statutes and regulations provide for penalties, including automatic debarment based on actions such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to a facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire Company in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.25 We are subject to various anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA, the U.S. Travel Act, and the USA PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are subject to the UK Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Chapter 9 (sub-chapter 5) of the Israeli Penal Law, 1977, the Israeli Prohibition on Money Laundering Law–2000, and possibly other similar laws in countries outside of the U.S. in which we conduct our business or seek to sell our products. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corruptor other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.These laws also require that we keep accurate records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In addition, we may be held liable for violations committed of the FCPA or similar foreign laws by companies that we acquire.Any alleged or actual violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti- money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, investigations, enforcement actions, fines and other criminal or civil sanctions, adverse media coverage, loss of export privileges, or suspension or termination of government contracts. Responding to any investigation or enforcement action would require significant attention of our management and resources, including significant defense costs and other professional fees. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.We are subject to certain governmental regulatory restrictions and regulations relating to international sales.Some of our products are subject to ITAR, which is interpreted, enforced and administered by the U.S. Department of State. ITAR regulation controls not only the export, import and trade of certain products specifically designed, modified, configured or adapted for military systems, but also the export of related technical data and defense services as well as foreign production. Any delays in obtaining the required export, import or trade licenses for products subject to ITAR regulation and rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, changes in U.S. export and import laws that require us to obtain additional export and import licenses or delays in obtaining export or import licenses currently being sought could cause significant shipment delays and, if such delays are too great, could result in the cancellation of orders. Any future restrictions or charges imposed by the U.S. or any other country on our international sales or foreign subsidiary could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, from time to time, Gresham has entered into contracts with the Israeli MOD which were governed by the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program (“FMF”). Any such future sales would be subject to these regulations. Failure to comply with FMF rules could subject us to investigations that could lead to civil, administrative and possible criminal prosecution, which have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating results and/or prospects for obtaining future government business. Failure to comply with ITAR or FMF rules could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and/or operating results. We are also required to obtain export licenses before filling foreign orders for many of our products that have military or other governmental applications. The U.S. Export Administration regulations control technology exports like our products for reasons of national security and compliance with foreign policy, to guarantee domestic reserves of products in short supply and, under certain circumstances, for the security of a destination country. Thus, any foreign sales of our products requiring export licenses must comply with these general policies. Compliance with these regulations is costly, and these regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to improve our technologies, incur expenses or both in order to comply with such regulations.If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover additional material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover additional material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.We have noted the following deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses: •At December 31, 2023, we did not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricted our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. •Due to our size and nature, the Company is not able to maintain appropriate segregation of conflicting duties as it is not always possible and is not economically feasible.26 •Our primary user access controls to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented effectively. We did not design and /or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems affecting our processes. •Due to the lack of appropriate personnel necessary for financial reporting, the Company has failed to properly account for complex financial instruments. While we want to begin remediating these material weaknesses, our management has been distracted with our liquidity concerns. When we can obtain the cash resources, we expect to increase our accounting staff. With our recent reductions of employees, we did not lay off any accounting personnel. However, our vice president of finance who acted as our comptroller resigned last year and we must replace him. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common StockBecause of limited volume of our common stock, you may not be able to sell many shares without depressing the price.There has been a relatively illiquid public market for our common stock on the OTCQB. The average daily trading volume of our shares of common stock during 2023 was approximately 9,250 shares and during 2024 through the date of the Report was approximately 1,700 shares. Accordingly, you may not be able to trade a large amount of our common stock without depressing the price. Further, the low market cap may impede our ability to solve our liquidity issues and prevent us from listing our common stock on a national securities exchange.Our stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.In addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, the market price of and trading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include: •the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of Gresham and other companies in our industry; •strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; •announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors; •the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; •lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or market opportunities in the defense electronics industry; •changes in government policies in the U.S. and, as our international business increases, in other foreign countries; •changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet those expectations; •market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; •changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; •any lawsuit involving us, our solutions or our product offerings; •arrival and departure of key personnel; •sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and •changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters or the banking crisis.  Any of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares, if at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a 27 company’s shares, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior management’s attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential additional issuance of preferred stock.Our charter documents give our board of directors (the “Board”),the right to create new series of preferred stock. As a result, our Board may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.Because our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, it is more difficult to buy our shares.The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. Unless we are listed on the NYSE American, or the Nasdaq Stock Market or if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00 (as it is now), our common stock will be a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty buying their shares. Also it is increasingly harder for stockholders to deposit penny stock with broker-dealers which may discourage others from buying our common stock.We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any earnings will be retained to finance the implementation of our operational business plan and expected future growth"
0,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2023-05-11,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth in this Report and the other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),including the Company’s financial statements and related notes, in evaluating the Company’s business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on the Company’s operations and business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently considers immaterial, may also impair its business or operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company’s business and financial condition, results or prospects could be harmed. Please also read carefully the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. If any of the events or developments described below occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In that case, the value of our common stock may decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. 17 Risk Factors
 Summary Our business and an investment in our common stock are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this “Risk Factors
” section below. Some of these risks include:•We have doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.•Our legacy Giga-tronics business essentially has no backlog and as a result is unlikely to generate sufficient cash to cover its operating costs in 2023 and its future is uncertain. •We have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flow and our operating results may significantly vary from quarter-to-quarter, so we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.•Because Ault is ending its support, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, and our inability to generate or obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.•Because we require consents for certain debt financings and acquisitions, we may not be able to pursue these transactions we cannot obtain the consents.•As a result of our outstanding indebtedness and related warrants, our stockholders are subject to significant future dilution.•A large percentage of our current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in government funding or a change in government spending priorities or bidding processes could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•If our reputation or relationships with the governments of the U.S., the UK or Israel or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected. •Because we engage in fixed fee contracts with our customers, we face pressure on our gross profit margins and operating costs from inflation.•Governments typically may terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion, which could lead to unexpected loss of sales and reduction in our backlog.•The integration of our business and any future acquisitions may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.•Our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which could result in material non-cash charges to its results of operations.•The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions elsewhere in the world on the capital markets and the economy is uncertain, and we may have to deal with a recessionary economy and economic uncertainty including possible adverse effects upon the capital markets.•If the inflationary pressures in the United States and elsewhere where we operate continue, we could experience reduced margins and lose future business.•Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly. •Our sales are significantly dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers.•We face intense industry competition and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could increase our losses.•If we are unable to monetize our EW business, we may be required to discontinue its business.•If we are unable to identify, attract, train and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to effectively execute our business strategy.•Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation.•Supply chain disruptions and our inability to procure necessary component parts for our products have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the future.•We may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase too much inventory.18 •We depend on a limited number of major customers for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of any of these customers, or the substantial reduction in the quantity of products that they purchase from us, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.•We depend on international sales for a material portion of our revenue.•Our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by potential political, economic and military instability in Israel.•Many of Enertec’s employees are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel, which could have a disruptive impact on our business.•Our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete, and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us, the results of which could be costly.•We may in the future be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.•Our businesses are subject to government procurement laws and regulations.•If we fail to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.•If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.•The price of our common stock may have little or no relationship to the historical bid prices of our common stock on the OTCQB.•The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.•Our stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.•If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. •If our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares. •We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Risks Related to our Financial Condition We have doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of May 11, 2023, we believe that there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we have incurred recurring net losses, our operations have not provided cash flows, and Ault ended its support of our operations with the limited exception of the payment of approximately $425,000 no later than May 31, 2023. Convertible notes issued to Ault and a subsidiary mature on December 31, 2024.  Our inability to continue as a going concern could have a negative impact on the Company, including our ability to obtain needed financing, and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We owe $3.3 million to holders of our convertible notes which are due in October 2023 and do not expect we will have the funds to repay these notes without completing a financing. Our legacy Giga-tronics business essentially has no backlog and as a result is unlikely to generate sufficient cash to cover its operating costs in 2023 and its future is uncertain.  Certain Microsource customers will not place any significant new orders since such customers have been scaling back legacy fighter programs. While our Giga-tronics EW Division’s product offerings are state-of-the-art, it currently has no backlog. While it expects an order from a customer in Q2 2023, there are no assurances that the order will be placed. Moreover, due to timing and the need to acquire inventory, this Division is likely only to generate $2.0 million in 2023 revenue. As a result, it is unlikely that the legacy Giga-tronics business can generate sufficient cash to cover its operating expenses and will require approximately $6.0 million to break even in 2023. While the Company believes that the legacy Giga-tronics business have prospects for growth over the next 12-24 months including sales of Microsource products to customers outside of the United States, the timing and volume of such business remains uncertain and such growth will require an influx of additional working capital to support its operations.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the legacy Giga-tronics business will remain in business. 19 As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we wrote off $10.5 million representing the goodwill arising from the legacy Giga-tronics business. We have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flow and our operating results may significantly vary from quarter-to-quarter, so we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. We have historically experienced net losses and we anticipate continuing to experience some losses in the future. Our operating results are largely determined by the results of operations of Gresham because they are more significant than our legacy Giga-tronics business. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Gresham reported revenue of $30,255,000 and $25,580,000 and net losses of $17.899,000 and $2,863,000 respectively. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop and market our products and services and we could continue to incur losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operating results have in the past been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may increase in magnitude, in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding for our products in our customers’ budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenue, and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenue in any future period. In addition, the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable, have been difficult for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results for such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. Finally, supply chain issues may affect future quarters. With our expected reductions in California expenses, it is uncertain whether our operating expenses may continue to increase. Expanding our operations may also impose significant demands on our management, finances and other resources. Our ability to manage the anticipated future growth, should it occur, will depend upon expansion of our accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation and subsequent improvement of a variety of systems, procedures and controls. We cannot assure you that significant problems in these areas will not occur. Our failure to expand these areas and implement and improve such systems, procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our attempts to expand our marketing, sales, manufacturing and customer support efforts may not succeed or generate additional sales or profits in any future period. With an increase in our operating expenses, along with the difficulty in forecasting revenue levels, we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve a level of revenue adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional financings necessary to support our working capital requirements. Because Ault is ending its support, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, and our inability to generate or obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Ault has publicly announced that it intends to distribute its shares of our common stock, on a pro rata basis to the holders of Ault common stock, subject to regulatory approval (the “Distribution”). Ault will not support us financially in the future. Ault Lending, an Ault subsidiary, potentially may lend us $425,000 through May 2023 in connection with our December 31, 2022 issuance to Ault Lending of a 10% senior secured convertible note in the principal amount of $6,750,000.  We will need to raise additional capital to pay our indebtedness and to support our working capital requirements and our planned growth. Ault currently has over 35,000 stockholders that will receive shares of our common stock in connection with the Distribution. We estimate that the cost of printing and mailing of proxy materials for an annual meeting in compliance with the SEC rules and regulations will increase by approximately $100,000 on annual basis. This will further increase our need to secure additional financing to fund our operations. Any other future financing may include shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, units consisting of the foregoing securities, equity investments from strategic development partners or some combination of the foregoing. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail our operations and take additional measures to reduce costs, including reducing our workforce and eliminating outside consultants in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. This could in its turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and future prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any future financing.  Because we require consents for certain debt financings and acquisitions, we may not be able to pursue these transactions we cannot obtain the consents. We issued Ault Series F preferred stock and common stock upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The term of the Series F contains negative covenants that apply until Ault completes the Distribution. Until that occurs, we must obtain Ault’s consent before, among 20 other things, incurring indebtedness of $1,000,000 in any individual transaction or $2,500,000 in the aggregate, or acquiring any business in which the aggregate consideration payable by us is $1 million or more. In addition, if we issue further equity, subject to exceptions for certain excluded securities, such limited issuances pursuant to equity incentive plans, Ault will have the right to purchase additional equity to maintain its ownership interest. Even when Ault fully converts the Series F into shares of our common stock prior to the Distribution, the Convertible Notes that we issued in connection with the Ault Financing and the transaction documents that we entered into in connection with our January 2023 sale of $3.3 million in Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the “Notes”) with the two investment funds (the “Lenders”) contain substantially similar covenants that are included in the Series F. These provisions could limit our ability to raise capital or make future acquisitions, particularly larger acquisitions. For more information about these negative covenants, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources – Our Recent Financings.” As a result of our outstanding indebtedness and related warrants, our stockholders are subject to significant future dilution. As of May 4, 2023 we had $14.4 million in outstanding indebtedness evidenced by convertible notes which are convertible into 18.5 million shares of our common stock, subject to possible increases, and 2 million warrants exercisable for nominal consideration and 69,000 warrants exercisable for $3.92 per share. Because of our cash needs, it  likely will have to engage in a new financing or modification of our existing financings or at least the $3.3 million of convertible notes. Any new financing or modification may be even further dilutive to our stockholders. Further, the Ault and Ault Lending notes and the Notes each have price protection so if we enter into a new financing with a lower conversion or exercise price, those instruments will automatically be adjusted resulting in further dilution.  Economic, Policy and Business Risks A large percentage of our current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in government funding or a change in government spending priorities or bidding processes could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The defense programs on which we compete with other policy needs, which may be viewed as more necessary, for limited resources and an ever-changing amount of available funding in the budget and appropriation process. For example, budget and appropriations decisions made by the governments of the United States, the UK and Israel are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for its business. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, and the purchase of our products could be superseded by alternate arrangements. While defense budgets in countries around the world have recently increased, there can be no assurance that such increases will continue for the foreseeable future. A change in government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total defense spending, could have material adverse consequences on our future business. If our reputation or relationships with the governments of the U.S., the UK or Israel or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.  Gresham Worldwide derives most of its revenue from the governments of the U.S., the UK and Israel as well defense contractors across the world that supply those countries and their allies. Our reputation and relationships with various government entities and agencies, in particular with the U.S. Department of Defense and Ministries of Defense in the UK and Israel, and the limited number of defense contractors serving these agencies, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Because we engage in fixed fee contracts with our customers, we face pressure on our gross profit margins and operating costs from inflation. Our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively impacted by increased levels of inflation. We are not able to predict the timing and effect of inflation, or its duration and severity. Inflation may cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and reduce our gross profit margins. Also inflation tends to increase our compensation and other costs. We may not be able to sell our products to our customers at correspondingly increased prices to cover the impact of inflation, resulting in decreased profit margins. Governments typically may terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion, which could lead to unexpected loss of sales and reduction in our backlog. Under the terms of our contracts with prime defense contractors, the military may unilaterally: 21 •terminate or modify existing contracts;•reduce the value of existing contracts through partial termination; and •delay the payment of our invoices by government payment offices and/or contractors directly serving the government.  The government can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us or our prime contractors either for the federal government’s convenience, or if we or our prime contractors default, by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination arising out of our default could expose it to liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to compete for future government contracts and subcontracts. If the government or its prime contractors terminate and/or materially modify any of our contracts or if any applicable options are not exercised, our failure to replace sales generated from such contracts would lower sales and would adversely affect our earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. While our backlog as of March 31, 2023, was approximately $25.7 million, our backlog could be adversely affected if contracts are modified or terminated. We may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time.  We remain subject to certain past, current, and future liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments against or affecting us, including the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there may be liabilities of ours that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future, including indemnification requests received from our customers relating to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights, tax liabilities arising in connection with ongoing or future tax audits and liabilities in connection with other past, current and future legal claims and litigation. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may learn additional information that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted, or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights. The integration of our business and any future acquisitions may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination will depend in significant part upon whether we are able to integrate our combined business in an efficient and effective manner. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. The companies may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully or on a timely basis. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, managements, systems of controls, and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The companies operate numerous systems and controls, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance. The integration of operations following the Business Combination and future acquisitions will continue to require the dedication of significant management and external resources, which may distract management’s attention from the day-to-day business of the Company and be costly. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business. Any inability of management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, our former Chief Executive Officer elected to retire in January 2023, which may be perceived negatively by our legacy employees, contractors, customers or other stakeholders. In addition, we plan to make additional acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Whenever we make acquisitions, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies’ personnel and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect any expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following: •difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations; •integration of new employees and management into our culture while maintaining focus on operating efficiently and providing consistently high-quality goods and services; •potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies; •complexity associated with managing our company; •difficulty of incorporating acquired rights or products into our existing business; •difficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities; •difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; •potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; 22 •potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross- marketing of the products to new and existing customers; •effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired; and •potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition. Our business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with these acquisitions, many of which cannot be presently identified, these risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which could result in material non-cash charges to its results of operations. We have goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions by Gresham of its subsidiaries in the past. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of each reporting unit.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we will record an impairment charge. Determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimated fair values could change if there are changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. If we are required to recognize future non-cash charges related to impairment of goodwill, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. At December 31, 2022, we carried a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. To the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated and its underlying assumptions and estimates related to the fair value determination are not met, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we could be required to record impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $10.46 million associated with the acquisition of Giga-tronics business. Refer to Note 9 - Goodwill of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and supplementary Data of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information Our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited As of December 31, 2022, we had a pre-tax federal net operating loss carryforward of $18,384,000 and a state net operating loss carryforward of $22,360,000 available to reduce future taxable income, if any, prior to limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) or otherwise. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire from year ending 2023 through 2038 and from 2031 through 2042, respectively. The federal net operating loss amount of $3,286,000 from year ended 2017 through 2022 will have an indefinite life. As of December 31, 2022, we had $10,206,000 of foreign net operating loss carryforward.  As a result of the Business Combination, we generally continue to carry such NOLs, but we may be unable to fully use such NOLs, if at all. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (very generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in the corporation’s equity ownership by certain stockholders or groups of stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. In addition, we may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in its stock ownership. Future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize its NOLs. To the extent our NOLs are not utilized to offset future taxable income, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates and the rules governing NOL carryforwards. For U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, with certain exceptions, the Tax Act as modified by the CARES Act limits a taxpayer’s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, to 80% of taxable income. In addition, U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets for NOLs will need to be measured at the applicable tax rate in effect when the NOLs are expected to be utilized. The new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset taxable income in the future. In addition, for state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions elsewhere in the world on the capital markets and the economy is uncertain, and we may have to deal with a recessionary economy and economic uncertainty including possible adverse effects upon the capital markets. While the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting international sanctions are uncertain, they have already had an immediate effect on the global economy, including the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom by causing, among other things, continued inflation and substantial increases in the prices of oil, gas and other commodities. The conflict has created increased uncertainty in the capital 23 markets with declines in leading market indexes. The duration of this conflict and its impacts are uncertain. Similarly, tensions in Asia with aggressive conduct in China and North Korea and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East have the potential further add to uncertainty and cause disruption in capital markets.  Finally, the recent banking crisis may limit traditional bank financing and lead to more issuers seeking capital from investment bankers and institutional investors. This may make it more difficult for us to raise capital and the result may be more expense and dilution. We cannot predict how these factors will affect the capital markets, but the impact may be adverse and may delay or prevent us from completing future financings or make any financings. If the inflationary pressures in the United States and elsewhere where we operate continue, we could experience reduced margins and lose future business. The current inflationary pressures are affecting our gross profit margins particularly since we have lacked the capital to accumulate material inventory. Most of our contracts (except with Relec) are fixed price, which reduces our margins when inflation occurs. Reducing our selling prices results in further reduction of our margins. This customer pricing pressure may also result in the loss of contracts and/or future business. Finally, we are experiencing rising labor and other costs which may further increase our losses. We may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy. Once we solve our working capital need, we plan to make additional acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Our acquisition growth strategy will involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We may be unable to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets and complete acquisitions. Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully integrate any target’s operations into our business. Additional factors may negatively impact our growth strategy. Our strategy may require spending significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms, we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects. If any of the aforementioned factors force management to alter our growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely affected. We will have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity as consideration in any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. Incurring indebtedness may result in increased fixed obligations and could limit our flexibility in managing our business due to covenants or other restrictions contained in debt instruments. In addition, Ault, prior to the Distributions and the Lenders, will have the right to approve or disapprove of any such indebtedness and certain acquisitions. Further, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions. Some acquisition targets may not have a developed business or will be experiencing inefficiencies and incur losses. Additionally, small defense contractors which we consider suitable acquisition targets may be uniquely dependent on their prior owners and the loss of such owners’ services following the completion of acquisitions may adversely affect their business. Therefore, we may lose our investment in the event that the acquired businesses do not develop as planned or that we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost efficiencies or reduction of losses. Even if we are able to do so, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and our business, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer. Additionally, our and Gresham’s acquisitions have previously required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant management efforts and expenditures. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, divert the attention of our management and key employees and increase our expenses. If we lose key personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Our success will depend on the continued contributions of key officers and employees. The loss of the services of key officers and employees, whether such loss is through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Although we expect most of our employees will continue to remain as our employees, it is possible some employees may quit. Depending upon who they are and how many employees quit, we may be adversely affected. With the closing of the Business Combination, our management, with the exception of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Technology Officer, was replaced by Gresham’s management. Our former Chief Executive Officer remained with us in the transition but elected to retire in January 2023 as a full-time employee.  If we were to lose Jonathan Read, Timothy Long, and/or Lutz Henckels, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively, our business would be materially and adversely affected. The loss of Zvika Avni, who manages our Israeli operations, could also materially harm our business. Our sales and profitability may be affected by changes in economic, business and industry conditions.24  If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their orders. In this environment, our customers may experience financial difficulty, reduce operations and fail to budget or reduce budgets for the purchase of our products. This may lead to longer sales cycles, delays in purchase decisions, payment and collection, and can also result in downward price pressures, causing our sales and profitability to decline. In addition, general economic uncertainty and general declines in capital spending in the defense electronics sector make it difficult to predict changes in the purchasing requirements of our customers and the markets we serve. There are many other factors which could affect our business, including: •Political factors, which result in a reduction of defense expenditures; •The end of the Russian war on Ukraine, easing of tensions in Asia and stability in the Middle East;•Gas shortages and environmental issues which divert defense expenditures in the United Kingdom; •The continuation of the banking crisis and its effects on the credit and capital markets;•The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies, products and services; •New competitors and new forms of competition; •The size and timing of customer orders (for retail distributed physical product); •The size and timing of capital expenditures by our customers; •Adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and suppliers; •Changes in the pricing policies of, or the introduction of, new products and services by us or our competitors;•Changes in the terms of our contracts with our customers or suppliers; •The availability of products and schedule for deliveries from our suppliers; and •Variations in product costs and the mix of products sold.  These trends and factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and diminish our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. We have been significantly short of capital needed to acquire parts for manufacture of our products to complete orders. At times, we have not had the cash available to make advance payments for the purchase of parts, and then, as a consequence, we would not receive the parts from our vendors required to finish a customer order. This would then delay the delivery of our products to customers and would also delay recognition of the resulting revenue and the receipt of cash from the customer. There can be no assurance that we will not operate at a loss during the current or future fiscal years. Our future profitability depends upon many factors, including several that are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:  •supply chain shortages which are currently ongoing; •changes in the demand for our products and services; •the availability of working capital;•the success of our plan to have our Microsource subsidiary work down the backlog at Microphase to accelerate revenues; •our loss of key customers or contracts; •our ability to hire engineers and other technical personnel; •the introduction of competitive products; •the failure to gain market acceptance of its new and existing products; and •changes in technology which cause some of our products to be obsolete.  Sales, Business Development and Competitive Risks 25 Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.  The timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry, a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts and our ability to timely develop, produce and upgrade our products. Most of our revenues result from a limited number of relatively large orders that we receive from prime defense contractors and government agencies. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints (including constraints imposed by governmental agencies), multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Even if we receive a purchase order from a customer, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed or the fiscal period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. For these reasons, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such unpredictable operating results may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Our sales are significantly dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers. A significant proportion of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace, which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, our sales may be less than projected with a resulting decline in revenues. As a result, our business depends upon continued U.S., Israeli, United Kingdom and other countries’ government expenditures on defense systems for which we provide support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time and have been reduced in some periods. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following: •Budgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding•A shift in expenditures away from defense programs that we support•U.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government and other potential delays in the appropriations process•Delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices•Changes in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events were to occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. We face intense industry competition and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could increase our losses. We operate in an industry that is generally characterized by intense competition. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the same major defense contractors and the government with whom we enter into contracts with and will continue these efforts in the future, and the governments may choose to use other contractors. We believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth of product line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts, price erosion, and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsaleable inventory that may need to be written off and, therefore, could reduce our profitability. Additionally, as we are seeing with Microsource, the U.S. military’s decision to discontinue ordering certain aircraft where Microsource acts as a supplier, results in our loss of orders. Because our competitors have greater resources, we may not compete effectively.  Several of our competitors, including, among others, K&L Microwave, Q Microwave, Amplitech, Qorvo, Northrop Grumman, Textron, Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market 26 conditions than us. We cannot provide assurance that any products developed by these competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. Our products compete and will compete with similar, if not identical, products produced by our competitors. These competitive products could be marketed by well-established, successful companies that possess greater financial, marketing, distribution personnel, and other resources than we do. These companies can implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. They can introduce new products to new markets more rapidly. In certain instances, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to enter a market in direct competition with us, offering attractive marketing tools to encourage the sale of products that compete with our products or present cost features that customers may find attractive. The markets for some of our products (such as our commercial products in the United Kingdom) are also subject to specific competitive risks because these markets are highly price sensitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. If they do so again, we may be forced to respond by lowering our prices. This would reduce revenue and increase losses. Failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may also further reduce our revenue and increase our losses. If we are unable to monetize our EW business, we may be required to discontinue its business. We initially sold our test solutions in laboratory settings. Competing against market incumbents in this segment exposed greater than expected challenges. Consequently, our EW test sales have fallen short of our expectations due to the longer than expected time required to establish credibility and grow market share in the laboratory segment. During fiscal 2021, we moved beyond the laboratory environment and pursued opportunities for open-air range applications for our Threat Emulation System (“TEmS”) solution. Market incumbents on these ranges offer single-purpose solutions because the applications being addressed are less data-intensive and narrower in their requirements compared to those in the laboratory environment. We successfully won sales into applications for air-crew training and air-to-ground missile testing. Through December 31, 2022, we have spent over $24.0 million towards the development of the TEmS solution, but in calendar year 2022, we only sold $1.8 million of EW test products. Over the last four years the sales of EW test products have averaged $2.6 million annually. Our inventory of EW test products was $1.43 million as of December 31, 2022. We have no backlog for our EW test products as of the date of this Report. However, we expect a new  order in May although due to  the current United States debt ceiling issues or other reasons, that order may be delayed or not received.  Accordingly, if we are unable to monetize our EW business, we may be forced to liquidate our remaining inventory and discontinue its operations.  The sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers. We depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue. Our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers. In some cases, our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements. If we are unable to satisfy such requirements, or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements, our business could be materially harmed. If we fail to anticipate and adequately respond to rapid technological changes in our industry, including evolving industry-wide standards, in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve for our customers. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals for our customers within the original development schedule of our products, then our customers may opt for competitive offerings or we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we can increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve promised delivery date to our customers or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Performance and Operational Risks If we are unable to identify, attract, train and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to effectively execute our business strategy.27  Our  performance and future success largely depends on its continuing ability to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including its management, sales and marketing, finance and in particular its engineering, design and technical personnel. For example, we currently have a limited number of qualified personnel for the assembling, tuning and testing processes. Members of our technical staff are nearing retirement, and it may be difficult to replace them, given their experience and expertise. In addition, we will need additional staff to drive Microphase’s forecasted growth and to allow Enertec to handle more large orders. We do not know whether we can expand our workforce as needed. Our engineering, design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. The competition for qualified personnel in the defense industry in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel is intense and constrains our ability to attract qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our  key engineering, design and technical personnel, or its inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation. Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that one of our products might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. Our EW test and training products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.  Our EW test and training systems are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors or performance problems following the sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development and sales efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and the relatively high selling price of our RADAR/EW testing platform. Our EW test and training platform has been a primary product development focus for the legacy Giga-tronics business for the last several years. However, delays in completing its initial development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our inability to generate material sales. Additionally, the average selling price of our EW test and training system is considerably higher than our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which requires additional internal approvals on the part of the customer and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity. Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and disruptions. As a defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and domestic terrorism events. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, which generally face similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular, are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic security breaches believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls and invested in skilled information technology resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and information technology networks and related systems could:  •disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore its operations and/or those of certain of its customers; 28 •result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, our proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, our operating companies or their customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and•damage our reputation with its customers and the United States, United Kingdom and Israel, and the public generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business. We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had disruptions to its business which caused a material effect on its business and results of operations. The future impacts on us, if any, are uncertain. Our business was materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions caused by the pandemic included temporary closures of our facilities, including a shutdown of our Microphase facility in Connecticut for three weeks in December 2020 and suspension of production operations for our Gresham Power subsidiary located in Salisbury, United Kingdom from March 19, 2020, until June 2020 and from November 2020 until the Spring of 2021. This resulted in a significant decrease of revenue in December 2020 and a decrease in January to February 2021. In addition, Gresham Power experienced substantial revenue decreases while shut down. In January 2022, Israel experienced a fifth wave of COVID-19 with the Omicron variant. Many of the workers of Enertec became ill and/or worked from home. Despite this disruption, it did not materially impact Enertec’s operations. We also incurred expenses related to implementing the workplace safety protocols and adjusting for remote working arrangements. Some non-production employees work remotely part of the time. However, not all employees are as efficient working remotely and our business may be adversely affected as the result. Additionally, certain employees at our production facilities must continue to work on site to continue manufacture for essential government programs. Further, lockdowns affected our sales and market strategy.  This resulted in an increase in the average length of sales cycles to onboard new customers and delays in new projects, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American, Israeli and United Kingdom economies sustained material slowdowns during part of the pandemic. While people continue to be infected with COVID-19, serious illnesses and deaths have diminished. As new variants rise, this trend may not continue.Because of the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we cannot be certain whether COVID-19 will adversely affect us in the future. Earthquakes and other events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our Giga-tronics facility is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters, epidemics, such as COVID-19, and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and success as an overall business. Supply chain disruptions and our inability to procure necessary component parts for our products have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the future. We manufacture some components for our products, but we rely on subcontract manufacturers to supply components for many of our product offerings. Our reliance upon such subcontract manufacturers involves several risks, including reduced control over manufacturing costs, delivery times, reliability and quality of components, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations, and continued inflationary pressures on many of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. If we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited 29 sources of supply, or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing capacity, the inability of our subcontract manufacturers to procure raw materials, the loss of key assembly subcontractors, difficulties associated with the transition to our new subcontract manufacturers or other factors, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, and delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments, any of which would materially harm our business. Supply chain disruptions have affected us. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we have experienced delays in our receipt of certain components, which temporarily delayed shipments in the U.S., the UK and Israel. Our Microsource, Microphase, Enertec, Gresham Power and Relec subsidiaries and Giga-tronics’ Division all have experienced supply chain disruptions, albeit in different ways. Our Giga-tronics Division experienced a 55-week delivery lead-time for a memory card and 36-week delivery lead-time for the chassis on which to build its TEmS that constrains the revenue that it can generate and cash flow. Microphase experienced a 45-week delay in securing certain video component parts for a customer, which adversely impacted Microphase’s revenues and cash flows.  While Relec experienced a spike in bookings, it encountered longer delivery lead-times for products it distributes. That in turn also delays fulfillment of orders, defers revenue recognition and increases capital requirements to finance the interval between payment for goods and release of goods from inventory to customers for payment. Enertec experienced problems with component delivery times in 2022. Enertec began purchasing component parts at least nine months in advance in 2022. The current situation has put a lot of pressure on Enertec’s cash flow. All our operating companies have implemented strategies to deal with extended delivery lead-times and manage customer expectations on delivery dates for our product offerings. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will succeed and supply chain issues will continue to cause challenges for our operating subsidiaries in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impacts on our supply chain throughout 2021 and 2022. Many of our suppliers have indicated similar challenges in keeping their own operations running and management believes there may still be some residual delays in fulfilling orders due to limited availability of parts and services. We expect this situation to improve toward the end of 2023.  We may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase too much inventory. The defense industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to business cycles. During periods of growth and high demand for our products, we may not have adequate supplies of inventory on hand to satisfy our customers’ needs. Furthermore, during these periods of growth, our suppliers may also experience high demand and, therefore, may not have adequate levels of the components and other materials that we require to build products so that it can meet our customers’ needs. Our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results. We may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components assuming we have available cash resources. Increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers’ end markets. If we purchase too much inventory, we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write-off the inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations. We depend on a limited number of major customers for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of any of these customers, or the substantial reduction in the quantity of products that they purchase from us, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our operating companies typically depend upon a limited number of major customers to generate a significant portion of its revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Enertec derived close to 90% and 95%, respectively, of its revenues from 2 customers.  In each of those years, 83% and  87% of Microphase revenues came from the same 6 customers while 3 customers accounted for 76% and 67% of the revenues of Microphase for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, there is no assurance that the customers, which account for the great proportion of sales in our operating companies will continue placing further orders beyond the backlog orders on hand now.  Among the factors that affect future orders are: •We have no intellectual property rights beyond trade secrets for the equipment we manufacture; •We are subject to competition from many manufacturers of purpose-built electronics; •We introduce a new upgraded version of the equipment which may not meet the customer’s needs; •Changing technology may make our products less useful to the customer; •The customer may decrease the size of its orders or seek to reduce our selling price at any time; •The customer may elect to use manufacturers other than our operating companies; and  If one or more of our major customers reduce or cancel their orders scaling back some of their activities, our revenue would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, reduction or diversions in defense spending may lead to reduced demand for our products, which could, in turn, have a 30 material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the financial condition of one or more of our major customers were to deteriorate, or if such customers have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenue would likely result.  If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed. We are experiencing, growth in our operations. This growth will place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. These systems improvements may require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to effectively manage our growth and would in its turn have a material adverse impact on our business and future operating results. If we are unable to successfully expand our production capacity, it could result in material delays, quality issues, increased costs, and loss of business opportunities, which may negatively impact our profit margins and operating results. Part of our future growth strategy is to increase our production capacity to meet increasing demand for our products. Assuming we obtain sufficient funding to increase our production capacity, any projects to increase such capacity may not be implemented on the anticipated timetable or within budget. We may also experience quality control issues as we implement any production upgrades. Any material delay in completing these projects, or any substantial cost increases or quality issues in connection with these projects could materially delay our ability to bring our products to market and adversely affect our business, reduce our revenue, income and available cash, all of which could harm our financial condition.  Our strategic focus on purpose-built electronics solution competencies and concurrent cost reduction plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete. We devote significant resources to developing and manufacturing bespoke electronics solutions for our customers. Each product typically represents a uniquely tailored solution for a specific customer’s requirements. Failure to meet these customer product requirements or a failure to meet production schedules and/or product quality standards may put us at risk with one or more of these customers. Moreover, changes in market conditions and changes in the needs and requirements of our customers may affect their purchasing decisions. The loss of one or more of our significant custom electronics solution customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, business or financial condition. We have implemented a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs. While we believe that these actions will have a positive impact, they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate. Early in 2023, we implemented a reduction in force by laying off 14 employees in our U.S. operations. We may be forced to take additional cost-reducing initiatives, including those involving personnel, which may negatively impact quarterly results of operations as it accounts for severance and other related costs. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could have long-term adverse effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for its solutions increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could adversely affect our operating results. Although we depend on sales of our legacy products for a meaningful portion of our revenue, as these products mature, we risk component parts becoming obsolete. A significant portion of our sales have historically been attributable to our legacy products. We expect that these products may continue to account for a meaningful percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As products mature, however, component parts may become obsolete and to the extent we require component parts we may incur significant expenses to find acceptable substitutes for obsolete parts or to retool and/or re-design such component part. If we fail to do so, we will be unable to sell such mature products. A significant portion of our contracts are fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation. We negotiate most of our contracts on a fixed-price basis which allows us to benefit from cost savings but also subject us to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts, because we assume the entire cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Government contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of our replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foresee ability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost 31 overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us. The United States, the United Kingdom and Israel are experiencing a significant increase in inflation, which could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if we fail to meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Many of our operating companies purchase a significant amount of its components and products outside of the countries in which they operate. With the exception of Microphase which sources all of its components, and Enertec which sources most of its parts, in the United States, we purchase a majority of our components from foreign manufacturers. In addition, we have a substantial majority of our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside the United States. These activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including trade barriers and other restrictions, changes in trade policies, governmental regulations, currency exchange fluctuations, reduced protection for intellectual property, war and other military activities, terrorism, changes in social, political, pandemic, or economic conditions, and other disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.  If we are unable to satisfy our customers’ specific product quality, certification or network requirements, our business could be disrupted, and our financial condition could be harmed. Our customers demand that our products meet stringent quality, performance and reliability standards. We have, from time to time, experienced problems in satisfying such standards. Defects or failures have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future, relating to our product quality, performance and reliability. From time-to-time, our customers also require us to implement specific changes to our products to allow these products to operate within their specific network configurations. If we are unable to remedy these failures or defects or if we cannot complete such required product modifications, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, including inventory write-offs, warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our business. Risks Related to our Foreign Operations We depend on international sales for a material portion of our revenue. Sales to customers outside of North America accounted for more than two thirds of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to represent a material portion of our total revenue. International sales are subject to the risks of international business operations as described above, as well as generally longer payment cycles, greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable, and currency restrictions. These risks include the following: •unexpected changes in practices, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, trade disputes, tax laws and treaties, particularly due to economic tensions and trade negotiations or other trade restrictions; •different labor laws and regulations;•exposure to many stringent and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security; •changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; •risks resulting from fluctuations of currency exchange rates; •risks relating to the trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions;•limitations on Gresham’s ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of its operations in other countries; •limited or potentially unfavorable intellectual property protection; and •exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.  International sales are also subject to the export laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. Further, our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Israel are subject to local regulation which may increase our costs.32  Any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by potential political, economic and military instability in Israel. A material portion of our business is conducted through Enertec, its Israeli subsidiary. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect Enertec’s operations. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity in Israel, has led to political turmoil as well as security and economic problems for Israel. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel’s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Enertec can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect our operations. There also has been more friction between the Biden Administration and the Israeli government, particularly with the recent change in that government and the proposed judicial reforms which have caused massive protests in Israel. If this were to result in reduced U.S. aid for Israel, it is possible that Enertec’s business could be adversely affected. Further, the protests may result in operating inefficiencies. In addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, since Israel’s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment. Damages to Enertec’s operations or injuries to employees from rockets launched from Gaza, Lebanon or Iran, — or outright war against Israel — may have a material and adverse effect upon our company. Our commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover its potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of Enertec’s employees are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel, which could have a disruptive impact on our business. Certain number of Enertec’s officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service. These military service obligations could have a disruptive impact on our business, if hostilities develop in the future, which may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to replace Relec’s senior management, it may encounter losses of business and operating losses. We acquired Relec on November 30, 2020, from its three owners who remained as employees following the closing. We expect that the two of three principals may resign or take a step back from the business after the three-year earn-out period expires in December 2023 or perhaps earlier. Relec relies upon its former owners’ personal relationships and skills to grow and maintain relationships with customers and suppliers. Once they resign, although management believes that it has a sound succession plan in place, Relec may encounter losses of business and operating losses. A material portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies, so fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  We face foreign exchange risks because a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies. Further, some suppliers to Enertec and Relec require payment in U.S. dollars, which also exposes us to risk. Generally, U.S. dollar strength adversely impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a substantial portion of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar denominated.  We also have foreign exchange risk exposure with respect to certain of its assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of its subsidiaries, and its financial results are affected by the re-measurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had gains from foreign currency exchange adjustment of $45,000 and $0 respectively.  Legal Risks 33 Our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete, and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us, the results of which could be costly. Many of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us. Although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights, trade secret laws and contractual obligations, these protections may not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property, nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement, we may be required to institute legal proceedings, which would be costly and would divert our resources from the development of our business. If we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products, our future results could be adversely affected. Although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us. In addition, parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products in the United States or abroad. We may in the future be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Competitors may infringe on our patents, trade secrets or the patents of our licensors. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, or we may be required to defend the validity or enforceability of such patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that either one or more of our patents or our licensors’ patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our patents do not cover that technology. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Interference proceedings filed by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions regarding our patents or patent applications or those of our partners or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may cause us to incur substantial costs and distract the attention of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Because of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Regulatory and Compliance Risks Our businesses are subject to government procurement laws and regulations. We must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with the government, including the business that we do as a subcontractor to large prime contractors that contract directly with the government. In complying with these laws and regulations, we incur additional costs. These costs may increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future government contracts.Some U.S. federal statutes and regulations provide for penalties, including automatic debarment based on actions such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to a facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire Company in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, 34 both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we fail to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We are subject to various anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA, the U.S. Travel Act, and the USA PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are subject to the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Chapter 9 (sub-chapter 5) of the Israeli Penal Law, 1977, the Israeli Prohibition on Money Laundering Law–2000, and possibly other similar laws in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our business or seek to sell our products. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corruptor other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In addition, we may be held liable for violations committed of the FCPA or similar foreign laws by companies that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti- money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, investigations, enforcement actions, fines and other criminal or civil sanctions, adverse media coverage, loss of export privileges, or suspension or termination of government contracts. Responding to any investigation or enforcement action would require significant attention of our management and resources, including significant defense costs and other professional fees. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, or allegations of such failure, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. We are subject to certain governmental regulatory restrictions and regulations relating to international sales. Some of our products are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (“ITAR”), which are interpreted, enforced and administered by the U.S. Department of State. ITAR regulation controls not only the export, import and trade of certain products specifically designed, modified, configured or adapted for military systems, but also the export of related technical data and defense services as well as foreign production. Any delays in obtaining the required export, import or trade licenses for products subject to ITAR regulation and rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, changes in United States export and import laws that require us to obtain additional export and import licenses or delays in obtaining export or import licenses currently being sought could cause significant shipment delays and, if such delays are too great, could result in the cancellation of orders. Any future restrictions or charges imposed by the United States or any other country on our international sales or foreign subsidiary could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, from time to time, Gresham has entered into contracts with the Israeli Ministry of Defense which were governed by the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program (“FMF”). Any such future sales would be subject to these regulations. Failure to comply with FMF rules could subject us to investigations that could lead to civil, administrative and possible criminal prosecution, which have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating results and/or prospects for obtaining future government business. Failure to comply with ITAR or FMF rules could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and/or operating results. We are also required to obtain export licenses before filling foreign orders for many of our products that have military or other governmental applications. United States Export Administration regulations control technology exports like our products for reasons of national security and compliance with foreign policy, to guarantee domestic reserves of products in short supply and, under certain circumstances, for the security of a destination country. Thus, any foreign sales of our products requiring export licenses must comply with these general policies. Compliance with these regulations is costly, and these regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to improve our technologies, incur expenses or both in order to comply with such regulations. If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. 35 If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have noted the following deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses:  •At December 31, 2022, we did not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricted our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. •Due to our size and nature, the Company is not able to maintain appropriate segregation of conflicting duties as it is not always possible and is not economically feasible.•Our primary user access controls to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented effectively. We did not design and /or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems affecting our processes. •Due to the lack of appropriate personnel necessary for financial reporting, the Company has failed to properly account for complex financial instruments.  We are focused on remediating these material weaknesses, but our management has been distracted with our liquidity concerns. When we can obtain the cash resources, we expect to increase our accounting staff. With our recent reductions of employees, we did not lay off any accounting personnel. However, our vice president of finance recently resigned and we must replace him. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock We may not achieve the benefits expected from the Distribution and may be more susceptible to adverse events. We expect that, as a company independent from Ault, we will be able to grow organically and through acquisitions. Nonetheless, we may not be able to achieve any of these benefits. Further, by separating from Ault, there is a risk that we may be more susceptible to adverse events than we would have otherwise experienced as a subsidiary of Ault. As a subsidiary of Ault, we enjoyed certain benefits, including economies of scope and scale in securing capital, covering accounting, finance and benefits costs, and business relationships. These benefits may not be as readily achievable as a smaller, stand-alone company. Because the Distribution will significantly increase the number of free trading shares it is likely many Ault stockholders will sell their common stock which may depress our stock price. Immediately after the Distribution, it is possible that there may be a larger number of sellers than purchasers of the Company’s common stock, as our new stockholders may not be interested in owning our common stock and may sell their shares of our common stock. If such a situation occurs, the price of our common stock would likely be materially reduced.  The price of our common stock may have little or no relationship to the historical bid prices of our common stock on the OTCQB. There has been a relatively illiquid public market for our common stock on the OTCQB. The average daily trading volume of our shares of common stock during 2022 was 1,414 shares as of December 30, 2022.  It is difficult to predict the broader market demand for our common stock and thus the price of our common stock after giving effect to the Distribution. As a result, you should not rely on these historical sales prices as they may differ materially from subsequent prices and the trading volume of our common stock following the Distribution. The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock. Our charter documents give our board of directors (the “Board”),the right to create new series of preferred stock. As a result, our Board may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.36  Our stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation. In addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, the market price of and trading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include: •the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry; •strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; •announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors; •the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; •lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or market opportunities in the defense electronics industry; •changes in government policies in the United States and, as our international business increases, in other foreign countries; •changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet those expectations; •market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; •changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; •any lawsuit involving us, our solutions or our product offerings; •arrival and departure of key personnel; •sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and •changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters or the banking crisis.  Any of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares, if at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s shares, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior management’s attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock will likely decline.  The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts, over whom we have no control, publish about our business and us. We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the market price for our common stock could decline. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue unfavorable commentary, even if it is inaccurate, or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.  The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. Unless we are listed on the NYSE American, or the Nasdaq Stock Market or if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00 (as it is now), our common stock will be a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction 37 in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any earnings experienced by us will be retained to finance the implementation of our operational business plan and expected future growth.  Additionally, any additional financings may be dilutive to our stockholders, and such dilution may be significant based upon the size of such financing"
7,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2022-06-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our recent losses, limited liquidity and limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We incurred net losses of $2.7 million in fiscal 2022, and $0.4 million in fiscal 2021. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $34.0 million as of March 26, 2022. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested primarily in the development of the EW test segment with modular microwave up and down converters, real-time TEmS solution and integrated playback and record solutions. We initially sold our test solutions in laboratory settings. Competing against market incumbents in this segment has exposed greater than expected challenges. Consequently, our EW test sales have fallen short of our expectations due to the longer than expected time required to establish credibility and grow market share in the laboratory segment. During fiscal 2021, we moved beyond the laboratory environment and pursued opportunities for open-air range applications for our TEmS solution. Market incumbents on these ranges offer single-purpose solutions because the applications being addressed are less data-intensive and narrower in their requirements compared to those in the laboratory environment. Giga-tronics successfully won sales into applications for air-crew training and air-to-ground missile testing. Through March 26, 2022, the Company has spent over $24.0 million towards the development of the TEmS solution. During fiscal 2022, the Company only sold $610,000 of EW test products as compared to over $3 million in each of the prior two fiscal years due to the change in our market approach. These delays have contributed to a decrease in working capital from $3.5 million as of March 27, 2021 to $2.7 million as of March 26, 2022. During the same period, our inventory has increased by $1.3 million from $3.6 million as of March 27, 2021 to $4.9 million as of March 26, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and business solutions. These actions are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Part II-Item 8,  “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has adversely affected our business activities, financial condition and results of operations and may continue to do so. The spread of COVID-19 and the resulting “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions and other precautions have caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which have disrupted our business and may continue to do so for an undeterminable amount of time. These restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees have affected our business and operations by, among other things, causing temporary facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; requiring modifications to our business processes; limiting our access to customers and their sites and physical facilities; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; and increasing the risk that supply chains may be disrupted. These impacts have caused and may continue to cause delays in the receipt of customer orders, delays in product shipments and decreases in revenue, profitability, and cash flows from operations, which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. With the availability of vaccines, we expect the negative impacts of the pandemic to continue to diminish going forward. However, the potential duration, future trajectory of reported cases and impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty. We have significant working capital requirements and have experienced operating losses. If we continue to experience operating losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon obtaining revenues from sales of our products and raising additional capital from investors to meet our working capital needs. Since 2011, we have relied on a series of sales of our preferred stock and common stock, product line sales and loans to fund our operating cash flow deficits. There is no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or positive net operating cash flows to meet our working capital requirements and pay our debts as they become due in the future. We incurred net losses of $2.7 million in fiscal 2022 and $393,000 in fiscal 2021. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $34.0 million as of March 26, 2022. Since fiscal year 2013, we have incurred expenditures of approximately $24.0 million for the development of our RADAR/EW system product platform. Although we have shipped RADAR/EW system products to several customers, potential delays in the development of additional product features and upgrades, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could contribute to additional future losses and reduced liquidity. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. The lack of adequate working capital from any inability to generate positive net cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue, delay or suspend research and development activities, product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As a result, we may also be required to further reduce expenses if our RADAR/EW product platform sales goals are not achieved and could, for example, choose to focus solely on our Microsource segment, which we expect to be more predictable and profitable than our Giga-tronics business segment, to generate revenue and cash from operating activities. As part of such a restructuring, management believes the microwave components which the Company developed for the RADAR/EW test systems in the Giga-tronics business segment could be a source of growth for the Microsource segment.        8     Table of Contents We may require additional capital to support our current operations and this capital may not been readily available. To support our operations and to bring our RADAR/EW product platform to its full potential, we may need to seek additional working capital; however, there are no assurances that such working capital will be available, or available on terms acceptable to us. Our history of losses, changes to our product focus and the development of new products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business outlook and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies developing new products as we have, in fact, encountered. In particular, there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:   ●  implement or execute our current business plan;   ●  successfully and timely sell, manufacture and ship our products;   ●  raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to carry out our business plan.  If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, to the extent we satisfy our working capital needs by incurring additional debt, our operating cash flow may suffer in order to satisfy debt service obligations. The Exchange Agreement with BitNile and Gresham limits the Company's ability to sell additional shares of stock or incur additional indebtedness without BitNile’s consent. These restrictions may prevent us from issuing shares of stock or borrowing to meet our capital needs. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any necessary financing, if available, would be available on attractive terms. If our financial condition were to worsen and we were unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.  Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.  The timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry, a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts and our ability to timely develop, produce and upgrade our products. Most of our revenues result from a limited number of relatively large orders that we receive from prime defense contractors and government agencies. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints (including constraints imposed by governmental agencies), multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Even if we receive a purchase order from a customer, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed or the fiscal period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. For these reasons, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such unpredictable operating results may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Our sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers. All of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace, which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, our sales may be less than projected with a resulting decline in revenues. As a result, our business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on defense systems for which we provide support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time and have been reduced in some periods. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and the trading price of our common stock could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following:   ●  budgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding;   ●  a shift in expenditures away from defense programs that we support;   ●  efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs;   ●  U.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government and other potential delays in the appropriations process;   ●  delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices;   ●  changes in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities.         9     Table of Contents Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events were to occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. If our reputation or relationships with the U.S. Federal Government or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.  We derive substantially all of our revenue from the U.S. Federal Government, its agencies and several defense contractors that supply them. Approximately $22 million of our total combined revenues for the two fiscal years ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 were derived from contracts with the U.S. Federal Government and its agencies, either directly or through defense contractors with whom we have contracted. Our reputation and relationships with various U.S. government entities and agencies, in particular with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy, and the limited number of defense contractors serving these agencies, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively impacted by increased levels of inflation. The Company is not able to predict the timing and effect of inflation, or its duration and severity. Inflation may cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and we may not be able to sell our products to our customers at correspondingly increased prices, resulting in decreased profit margins. Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in delays of sales or shipments or our liability for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting.  We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. Our customers may also require that we adopt and maintain procedures affecting our operations, such as information security measures. If we experience difficulty or are unable to comply with these requirements, we could face delays in the receipt of orders, production of products and performance of services and sales, or the loss of any of these. Some U.S. federal statutes and regulations provide for penalties, including automatic debarment based on actions such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to a facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire Company in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards. The market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved performance capabilities, and to continue to upgrade or enhance our existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development or enhancement of current or future products, or that such products will achieve sufficient market acceptance. The inability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner and to achieve sustained commercial market acceptance could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity. Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation. Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that one of our products might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally.        10     Table of Contents Our RADAR/EW testing system products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.  Our RADAR/EW testing system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors or performance problems following the sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development and sales efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. Our products contain components produced by suppliers which may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available in future periods, which could require that we redesign product components, lead to production delays and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Certain components produced by our suppliers may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available to us to produce our products. Such discontinuations or lack of supply could require us to seek replacement components that may take longer and cost more than initially expected to procure, redesign our products for different components and/or delay production of our products unless supplies become available, any of which could lead to delays in product sales and deliveries and, in turn, delayed or lost revenue. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards, product deliveries may be delayed or cancelled which would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Some of our customer contracts require that we maintain quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards. If we were unable to maintain such certifications and standards, our product shipments may be delayed or orders could be delayed or cancelled, any of which would cause us to lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. If we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services to customers. We could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not currently believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful, even if such claims are meritless. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:   ●  pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;    ●  cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;    ●  discontinue the use of infringing technology;    ●  expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;    ●  pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;    ●  license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or    ●  relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patents claims if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.  We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and the relatively high selling price of our RADAR/EW testing platform. Our RADAR/EW testing platform has been our primary product development focus for the last several years, however, delays in completing its initial development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased our accumulated deficit as of March 26, 2022. Additionally, the average selling price of our RADAR/EW system is considerably higher than our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which requires additional internal approvals on the part of the customer and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity. Our business depends on our intellectual property rights and, if we are unable to protect them, our competitive position may suffer. Our business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.        11     Table of Contents Our competitors have greater resources. Several of our competitors, including, among others, Northrup Grumman/Amherst, Textron/AAI, Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. We cannot provide assurance that any products developed by these competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. Business interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our primary facility and headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters, epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and success as an overall business. If we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. We rely on an internal information technology (“IT”) system monitored by certain internal employees to maintain our IT systems; maintain financial records; retain sensitive data, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, and suppliers; process orders; manage inventory; process shipments to customers; and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is critical to the classified processing and control standards that our suppliers require us to maintain and the success of our business operations and our strategic goals. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.  In addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third-party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to the Proposed Share Exchange Combining Giga-tronics and Gresham may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized. Giga-tronics and Gresham have operated and, until the completion of the Share Exchange, will continue to operate independently. The success of the proposed transaction will depend in part on the ability to realize efficiencies and synergies from combining the businesses of Giga-tronics and Gresham. To realize the anticipated benefits, Gresham and Giga-tronics must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt their existing businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits. If Giga-tronics experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on Giga-tronics during this transition period and for an undetermined period after the Share Exchange is completed. Termination of the Exchange Agreement could negatively impact Giga-tronics. If the Exchange Agreement is terminated, there may adverse consequences to Giga-tronics. For example, Giga-tronics’ business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Share Exchange, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the transaction. Also, Giga-tronics has incurred significant expenses in connection with and has devoted significant internal resources to the pursuit of the Share Exchange but the expected benefit of those investments will not be realized if the Share Exchange is not completed. Additionally, if the Exchange Agreement is terminated, the market price of Giga-tronics’ common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect an expectation that the Share Exchange will be completed. If the Exchange Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Giga-tronics may be required to pay to Gresham a termination fee of $1.0 million, Gresham’s warrant to acquire 433,333 shares of Giga-tronics common stock may become exercisable and Giga-tronics maybe required to immediately repay the $1.3 million loan received from a subsidiary of BitNile. Giga-tronics will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Share Exchange is pending that could adversely affect Giga-tronics’ business and operations. Subject to certain exceptions, Giga-tronics has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to completing the Share Exchange and to refrain from taking certain actions, such as selling shares of stock or incurring additional indebtedness without BitNile’s consent. These restrictions may prevent Giga-tronics from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Share Exchange. These restrictions may also prevent Giga-tronics from selling shares of stock or borrowing to meet its capital needs. In addition, uncertainty about the effect of the Share Exchange on customers, employees and others may have an adverse effect on Giga-tronics’ business, operations, and stock price. These uncertainties may impair Giga-tronics’ ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the transaction is completed.        12     Table of Contents Giga-tronics has and will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the Share Exchange and related transactions. Giga-tronics has incurred and expects to incur a number of significant non-recurring costs related to the Share Exchange and the related transactions, such as the anticipated reserve split of Giga-tronics common stock, the Delaware reincorporation, the public offering and the Nasdaq listing. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting, and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, filing fees, financial and other printing costs, and other related costs. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the Share Exchange is completed. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction costs. The Exchange Agreement limits Giga-tronics’ ability to pursue acquisition proposals. The Exchange Agreement generally prohibits Giga-tronics from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or facilitating certain third‑party acquisition proposals. These provisions, which could result in a $1.0 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances and Gresham’s warrant to purchase 433,333 shares of Giga-tronics common stock becoming exercisable, might discourage a potential acquirer that might otherwise have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Giga-tronics from considering or proposing such an acquisition. Risks Related to Investing in Our Securities Our common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Market and trading volumes have been limited.  As compared to a larger stock market with greater liquidity, our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB® Venture Market (“OTCQB”) which is the middle tier of the OTC Markets Group, reserved for companies that are registered and reporting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or a U.S. banking regulator. The volume of trading of our common stock on the OTCQB has been very thin. Therefore, an investor might find it more difficult than it would be on a larger stock exchange to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our securities. We cannot be certain that a more active trading market will develop or, if developed, be sustained. We also cannot be certain that purchasers of our common stock will be able to resell their common stock at prices equal to or greater than their purchase price. The development of a public market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. We do not have any control over whether there will be sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that an established and liquid market for our common stock will develop or be maintained. The market price of our common stock could experience significant fluctuations in response to our operating results and other factors. In addition, the stock market, in recent years, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These fluctuations, and general economic and market conditions, may cause the market price of our common stock to vary substantially. The trading price of our common stock may make it more difficult for you to trade shares of our common stock. We could become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rule if we fail to meet certain financial criteria set forth in the rule. If we become subject to the SEC’s penny stock rule, the rule would impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer would have to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, if it were to apply to us, the rule could have an adverse effect on the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and could affect the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our securities in the secondary market. If our common stock were to become a “penny stock” within the meaning of the rule, additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock. While our common stock is currently not subject to the SEC’s penny stock rule, some broker-dealers may nonetheless choose to not allow incoming transfers of our shares from other brokerage accounts or limit your ability to trade shares of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares, as well as having a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock. Our common stock ranks junior to all of our preferred stock and indebtedness. As of March 26, 2022, our outstanding preferred shares had an aggregate liquidation preference of $3.6 million and we had an aggregate of $4.3 million in debt and other liabilities including long term lease obligations. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of our common stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and all of the liquidation preferences on any then outstanding Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock have been paid. Consequently, if we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts to the holders of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. We have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, which may cause significant dilution to our shareholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings. As of March 26, 2022, we had 2,767,230 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 530,214 shares of common stock, outstanding options to acquire 353,037 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 156,544 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock. The fact that our shareholders, warrant holders and option holders could sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.         13     Table of Contents We may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder’s ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors, generally without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock would be dilutive to an existing shareholder’s ownership of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of common shareholders without their approval. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock.  We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our shareholders, so you will not receive any return on your investment in our common stock prior to selling your interest in the Company. We have never paid any dividends to our common shareholders and do not foresee doing so. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a regular basis. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your common stock and, for the other reasons discussed in this “Risk Factors
” section and in the “Risk Factors
” section of the documents incorporated herein by reference, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares. General Risk Factors
 The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. For example, we are required to make estimates about, among other things, accruals, inventory reserves, revenue and lease accounting as well as long-lived assets. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we may be required to significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results. Any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on us, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.  Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could be expensive, divert management’s attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Any inability to accurately and timely report and file our financial results could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, any internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital.        14     Table of Contents Our stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:   ●  our ability to execute our business plan;        ●  changes in our industry;        ●  competitive pricing pressures;        ●  our ability to obtain working capital financing;        ●  additions or departures of key personnel;        ●  increases in the number of shares of common stock outstanding as our preferred stock converts to common stock, or as warrants or options are exercised;        ●  sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders;        ●  operating results that fall below expectations, including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results;        ●  regulatory developments;        ●  economic and other external factors;        ●  investor perceptions regarding the proposed Share Exchange;    ●  period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;        ●  the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;        ●  changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;        ●  changes in expected national defense spending or budgets;        ●  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;    ●  domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;        ●  new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;        ●  the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and        ●  any future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and shareholders.  In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Our stock has historically traded on low volume on the OTCQB and, previously, on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Market and volume fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.  From time to time, our shareholders may decide to sell some or all of their shares of common stock that they currently hold or could acquire upon the conversion of our preferred stock or exercise of warrants or other derivative securities by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market. Any substantial sale of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. "
13,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2020-05-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (""COVID-19"") has adversely affected our business activities, financial condition and results of operations and may continue to do so.  The spread of COVID-19 and the resulting “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions and other precautions have caused severe disruptions in the United States economy, which have disrupted our business and may continue to do so. These restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees have affected our business and operations by, among other things, causing temporary facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; requiring modifications to our business processes; delaying the receipt of customer orders; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; and increasing the risk that supply chains may be disrupted. These impacts have caused and may continue to cause delays in product shipments, decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations, which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. The potential duration and impact of the outbreak on the United State economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty. We have significant working capital requirements and have experienced operating losses. If we continue to experience operating losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon obtaining revenues from sales of our products and raising additional capital from investors to meet our working capital needs. Since 2011, we have relied on a series of private placements and loans to fund our operating cash flow deficits. There is no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or positive net operating cash flows to meet our working capital requirements and pay our debts as they become due in the future due. 9  We incurred net losses of $687,000 in fiscal 2020, and $937,000 in fiscal 2019. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $30.6 million as of March 28, 2020. Through March 28, 2020, we have incurred expenditures of approximately $24.0 million for the development and marketing of our RADAR/EW system product platform. Although we have shipped RADAR/EW system products to several customers, potential delays in the development of additional product features and upgrades, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses and reduced liquidity. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. The lack of adequate working capital from any inability to generate positive net cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue, delay or suspend R&D, product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As a result, we may also be required to further reduce expenses if our RADAR/EW product platform sales goals are not achieved and could, for example, choose to focus solely on our Microsource business segment, which we expect to be more profitable than our Giga-tronics business segment, to generate revenue and cash from operating activities. As part of such a restructuring, management believes the microwave components which the Company developed for the RADAR/EW test systems in the Giga-tronics business segment could be a source of growth for the Microsource business segment. We may require additional capital to support our current operations and this capital may not been readily available. To bring the RADAR/EW product platform to its full potential, we may need to seek additional working capital; however, there are no assurances that such working capital will be available, or on terms acceptable to us. To the extent we satisfy our working capital needs by issuing additional equity securities, we will cause a dilution for our common stock. To the extent we satisfy our working capital needs by incurring additional debt, our operating cash flow may suffer in order to satisfy debt service obligations. Our recent history of losses, changes to our product focus and the development of new products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies developing new products as we have, in fact, encountered. In particular, there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:  ●implement or execute our current business plan, which may or may not be sound; ●successfully and timely sell, manufacture and ship our products; ●maintain our anticipated management; and ●raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to carry out our business plan. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any necessary financing, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.  Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.  The timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts and our ability to timely develop, produce and upgrade our products. 10  Most of our revenues result from a limited number of relatively large orders that we receive from prime defense contractors and governmental agencies. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints (including constraints imposed by governmental agencies), multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Even if we receive a purchase order from a customer, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed or the fiscal period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. For these reasons, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such unpredictable operating results may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.Our sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers. All of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace, which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, our sales may be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in revenues. As a result, our business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on defense for which we provide support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time and have been reduced in some periods. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following:  ●budgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding; ●a shift in expenditures away from defense programs that we support; ●efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs; ●U.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government and other potential delays in the appropriations process; ●delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices; ●changes in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities. Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. If our reputation or relationships with the U.S. federal government or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.  We derive substantially all of our revenue from the U.S. federal government, its agencies and several defense contractors that supply them. Approximately $21 million or 91% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 were derived from contracts with the U.S. federal government and its agencies, either directly or through defense contractors with whom with have contracted. Our reputation and relationships with various U.S. government entities and agencies, in particular with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy, and the limited number of defense contractors serving these agencies, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in delays of sales or shipments or our liability for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting.  We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. If we experience difficulty or are unable to comply with these requirements, we could face delays in the receipt of orders, production of products and performance of services and sales, or the loss of any of these. 11  Some U.S. federal statutes and regulations provide for penalties, including automatic debarment based on actions such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to a facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire Company in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Our markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards. The market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved performance capabilities, and to continue to upgrade or enhance our existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development or enhancement of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market sufficient market acceptance. The inability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner and to achieve sustained commercial market acceptance could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity. Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation. Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that one of our products might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. Our RADAR/EW testing system products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.  Our RADAR/EW testing system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development and sales efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.  Our products contain components produced by suppliers which may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available in future periods, which could require that we redesign product components, lead to production delays and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Certain components produced by our suppliers may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available to us to produce our products. Such discontinuations or lack of supply could require us to seek replacement components that may take longer and cost more than initially expected to procure, redesign our products for different components and/or delay production of our production unless supplies become available, any of which could lead to delays in product sales. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards, product deliveries may be delayed or cancelled which would adversely impact our business, operating result and financial condition. Certain of our customer contracts require that we maintain quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards. If we were unable to maintain such certifications and standards, our product shipments may be delayed or cancelled which would cause us to lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. 12  If we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services to customers. We could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not currently believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful, even if such claims are meritless. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:  ●pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  ●cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  ●discontinue the use of infringing technology;  ●expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  ●pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  ●license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  ●relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and high selling price of our RADAR/EW testing platform. Our RADAR/EW testing platform has been our primary product development focus during the past eight years, however, delays in completing its initial development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased our accumulated deficit as of March 28, 2020. Additionally, the average selling price of our RADAR/EW system is considerably higher than our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which in turn requires additional internal approvals on the part of the customer and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity. Our business depends on our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our competitive position may suffer. Our business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.  Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups can be expensive, divert management’s attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.    13  If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.  Any inability to accurately and timely report and file our financial results could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed.  As a result, any internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital.   Our competition has greater resources. Several of our competitors, including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by these competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. Business interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our primary facility and headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters, epidemics, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and success as an overall business. If we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected. We rely on an internal IT system monitored by certain internal employees and third-party service providers to maintain our IT systems; maintain financial records; retain sensitive data, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, and suppliers; process orders; manage inventory; process shipments to customers; and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is critical to the classified processing and control standards that our suppliers require us to maintain and the success of our business operations and our strategic goals. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.  In addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. 14  The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. For example, we are required to make estimates about, among other things, accruals, inventory reserves, revenue and lease accounting as well as other long lived assets. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we may be required to significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results. Any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on us, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Investing in Our Securities Our stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:  ●our ability to execute our business plan;    ●changes in our industry;    ●competitive pricing pressures;    ●our ability to obtain working capital financing;    ●additions or departures of key personnel;    ●increases in the number of shares of common stock outstanding as our preferred stock converts to common stock, or as warrants are exercised, or both;    ●sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders;    ●operating results that fall below expectations, including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results;    ●regulatory developments;    ●economic and other external factors;  ●period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;    ●the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;    ●changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;    ●changes in expected national defense spending or budgets;    ●operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;    ●domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;    ●new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;    ●the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and    ●any future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and shareholders. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Our stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the OTCQB Market and, previously, on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Market and volume fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 15  Our common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Market and trading volumes have been limited.  As compared to a larger stock market with greater liquidity, our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB™, which is the middle tier of the Over-the Counter Market, or the OTC, reserved for companies that are registered and reporting with the SEC or a U.S. banking regulator. The volume of trading of our common stock on the OTCQB has been very thin. Therefore, an investor might find it more difficult than it would be on a larger stock exchange to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our securities. We cannot be certain that a more active trading market will develop or, if developed, be sustained. We also cannot be certain that purchasers of our common stock will be able to resell their common stock at prices equal to or greater than their purchase price. The development of a public market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. We do not have any control over whether there will be sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that an established and liquid market for our common stock will develop or be maintained. The market price of our common stock could experience significant fluctuations in response to our operating results and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These fluctuations, and general economic and market conditions, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. The trading price of our common stock may make it more difficult for you to trade shares of our common stock. We could become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rule if we fail to meet certain financial criteria set forth in the rule. If we become subject to the SEC’s penny stock rule, the rule would impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer would have to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, if it were to apply to us, the rule could have an adverse effect on the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and could affect the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our securities in the secondary market. If our common stock were to become a “penny stock” within the meaning of the rule, additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in penny stocks, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock. While our common stock is not subject to the SEC’s penny stock rule, some broker-dealers may nonetheless choose to limit your ability to trade shares of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares, as well as having a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock. Our common stock ranks junior to all of our preferred stock and indebtedness. As of March 28, 2020, our outstanding preferred shares had an aggregate liquidation preference of $3.7 million and we had an aggregate of $4.6 million in debt and other liabilities including long term lease obligations. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of our common stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and all of the liquidation preferences on any then outstanding Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock have been paid. Consequently, if we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts to the holders of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. We have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, which may cause significant dilution to our shareholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.  As of March 28, 2020, we had 2,635,856 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 163,545 shares of common stock, options to acquire 240,758 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 2,698,164 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock. 16  The fact that our shareholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.  We may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder’s ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, generally without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock would be dilutive to an existing shareholder’s ownership of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of common shareholders without their approval. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock.  Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.  From time to time, certain of our shareholders may decide to sell some or all of their shares of common stock that they currently hold or could acquire upon the conversion of our preferred stock or exercise of warrants or other derivative securities by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market. Any substantial sale of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our shareholders, so you will not receive any return on your investment in our common stock prior to selling your interest in the Company. We have never paid any dividends to our common shareholders and do not foresee doing so. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a regular basis. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation.  As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your common stock and, for the other reasons discussed in this “Risk Factors
” section and in the “Risk Factors
” section of the documents incorporated herein by reference, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares. If securities industry analysts do not publish research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. Any trading market for our common stock may be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities industry analysts. If no securities industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event we are covered by analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our securities, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. "
8,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2019-05-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS If we do not generate sufficient net cash flow from our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed, our financial condition would be adversely affected, we may not to be able to execute our growth strategy and we could become insolvent. We cannot assure that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund our future working capital needs. We incurred net losses of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, and $3.1 million in fiscal 2018. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $28.5 million as of March 31, 2019. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested primarily in the development of our ASGA product platform for EW test and emulation applications, which we believe possesses greater long-term opportunities for revenue growth and improved gross margins compared to our previous general-purpose test and measurement product lines, the substantial majority of which have been sold as of March 31, 2018. Through March 31, 2019, the Company has spent approximately $20 million towards the development of the ASGA system product platform.  Although we have shipped ASGA system products to several customers, potential delays in the refinement of further features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses. 9  The lack of adequate working capital from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue or suspend product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any necessary financing, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.  Our recent losses and limited liquidity during most of Fiscal 2019 and prior fiscal years caused us to reduce product development expenditures and headcount. Our recent losses and limited liquidity caused us to reduce our R&D expenditures and headcount in fiscal 2019 and prior years. This prolonged reduction of R&D spending caused us to delay the development of certain features of our ASGA product platform. As a result of the Company’s improved operating performance in fiscal 2019, due in part to the receipt of a $4.0 million ASGA product order in February 2019, the receipt of $2.5 million in gross proceeds from the sale of 6.0% Series E Senior Convertible Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series E Shares”) between March 2018 and March 2019, and a projected increase in ASGA product sales in fiscal 2020, the Company anticipates hiring additional R&D personnel and incurring additional R&D expenditures during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Any delays in the receipt of future orders for our ASGA or other products would adversely impact our quarterly operating results during the second half of calendar 2020 and subsequent periods. We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and higher selling price of a new product platform. Our ASGA product platform has been our primarily product development focus during the past seven years, however, delays in completing its development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased accumulated deficit as of March 30, 2019. Additionally, the average selling price of our new ASGA products is considerably higher that our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which in turn, requires additional internal approvals on the part of the purchaser and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses. Our sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers. All of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. Our markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards. The market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity. Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation. Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future. 10  Our Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes. Our ASGA system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. Our products contain components produced by suppliers which may be discontinued or no longer available in future periods which could lead to production delays and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Certain components produced by our suppliers may be discontinued or no longer available to us to produce our products. Such discontinuations would require us to seek replacement components that may take longer than expected to procure and lead to delays in product sales. To date, procurement of replacement products has not had a significant adverse impact on our operating results, however, such occurrences in the future may adversely impact our business operations and financial condition. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with quality certifications and classified processing and control standards, product deliveries may be delayed or cancelled which would adversely impact our business, operating result and financial condition. Certain of our customer contracts require that we maintain quality certifications and classified processing and control standards. If we were unable to maintain such certifications and standards, our product shipments may be delayed or cancelled which would cause us to lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict future performance.  Our revenue, expenses and operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts, our ability to timely develop and produce our products, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K. There is a limited trading market for our common stock.  Although our common stock trades on the OTCQB Market, the trading volumes are generally low. As a result, there is limited liquidity for our common stock and it could be more difficult for investors to purchase or sell shares of our common stock compared to other publicly traded companies. In addition, because of the limited volume of trading in our common stock, a sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market could cause our stock price to decline significantly. Our common stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, receipt or cancellation of significant orders, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, the OTCQB Market and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 11  We may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder’s ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, generally without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be dilutive to a shareholder’s ownership of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of common shareholders without their approval. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock. We have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, which may cause significant dilution to our shareholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.  As of March 30, 2019, we had 11,360,511 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 3,452,000 shares of common stock, options to acquire 2,735,000 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 11,213,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock. The fact that our shareholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all. Holders of our outstanding preferred stock have rights that are preferential to and may conflict with the rights and interests of holders of our common stock.  As of March 30, 2019, we had 116,934 shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding with aggregate liquidation preferences of $7.2 million. In addition, we must obtain the approval of the holders of our Series E Shares to complete certain types of transactions. For example, the Certificate of Determination for our Series E Shares prohibits us from issuing any shares having preferences that are superior to or on parity with our Series E Shares and the Investor Rights Agreement with the holders of our Series E Shares require that we obtain the approval of holders representing 66.6% of the Series E Shares to incur any additional indebtedness, other than commercial bank debt or trade debt. These preferences and restrictions could make it more difficult to raise capital through sales of common stock, a new series of preferred stock or debt without the approval of the holders of our Series E Shares or other preferred shares, who interests may be different than those of our other shareholders who are not entitled to similar preferences or approval rights. Our competition has greater resources. Several of our competitors including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. 12  We may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings. In connection with the potential enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Additionally, we may not prevail in any future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.  Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups can be expensive, divert our attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs. If we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected. We rely on an internal IT system monitored by certain internal employees and third-party service providers to maintain our IT systems; maintain financial records; retain sensitive data, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, and suppliers; process orders; manage inventory; process shipments to customers; and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is critical to the classified processing and control standards that our suppliers require us to maintain and the success of our business operations and our strategic goals. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful. In addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition. Business interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our primary facility and headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and success as an overall business. 13  "
4,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2018-06-19,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our recent losses, limited liquidity and limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern We incurred net losses of $3.1 million in fiscal 2018, and $1.5 million in fiscal 2017. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $28.7 million as of March 31, 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested primarily in the development of our Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform for EW test & emulation applications (formerly referred to as “Hydra”) which the Company believes possesses greater long-term opportunities for revenue growth and improved gross margins compared to our previous general-purpose test & measurement product lines, the substantial majority of which have been sold as of March 31, 2018. Through March 31, 2018, the Company has spent over $13 million towards the development of the ASGA system product platform. Although we anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the new ASGA product platform, delays in completing it have also contributed to our losses. We have also experienced delays in the development of features, receipt of orders, and shipments for the new ASGA system products. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $620,000 at March 25, 2017 to ($386,000) at March 31, 2018. Although ASGA system products have now shipped to several customers, potential delays in the refinement of further features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses. These matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Part II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan. 8  We face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and higher selling price of a new product platform We invested heavily in the development of our new ASGA product platform, however, delays in completing its development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2018. Additionally, the average selling price of our new ASGA products is considerably higher that our prior general-purpose test & measurement products, which in turn, requires additional internal approvals on the part of the purchaser and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses. Trading of our common stock has moved from the NASDAQ Capital Market to the OTCQB Market On May 4, 2017, we received a notification letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) advising the Company that it has initiated proceedings to delist the Company from NASDAQ for the Company’s failure to comply with NASDAQ’s bid price rule. As previously reported on November 1, 2016, NASDAQ notified the Company that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than $1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, thus, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”). On October 30, 2017, the Company’s common stock began trading on the OTCQB Market. The Company’s ticker symbol (GIGA) remained the same. As a result of this change, there may be reduced liquidity for our common stock and it could be more difficult for investors to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. Giga-tronics Inc. remains a public company following the delisting and our shares will continues to trade publicly. We will continue to make SEC filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and we will remain subject to the SEC rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies under the Exchange Act. We will maintain an independent Board of Directors with an independent Audit Committee and provide annual financial statements audited by an independent auditor and unaudited interim financial reports reviewed by our independent auditors, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers All of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. Our markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards The market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict future performance  Our revenue, expenses and operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts, our ability to timely develop and produce our products, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 9  Our common stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, receipt or cancellation of significant orders, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, the OTCQB Market and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the NASDAQ Capital Market and OTCQB Market. Sales of a significant volume of stock could result in a decline of our share price. Performance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors’ products may harm our business and reputation Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future. Our competition has greater resources Several of our competitors including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. We may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings In connection with the potential enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Additionally, we may not prevail in any future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we do not generate net cash flow from our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition would be adversely affected and we may not to be able to execute our growth strategy and we could become insolvent We cannot assure that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund our future working capital needs. The lack of additional working capital from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue or suspend unprofitable product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any necessary funds, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy. 10  Our Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes. Our new ASGA system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.  Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies.

10,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2017-06-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Future liquidity is uncertain We incurred net losses of $1.5 million in fiscal 2017, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2016. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $25.6 million as of March 25, 2017. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested substantially in the research and development of our new product line, ASG. We anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the ASG platform, but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. We also experienced delays in the development of features, orders, and shipments for the new ASG. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $1.8 million at March 26, 2016, to $620,000 at March 25, 2017. The Advanced Signal Generator product has now shipped to several customers, but potential delays in the refinement of features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to continue shipments in volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses.  These matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” (Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan). Customer orders and production of new product platform We invested heavily in the development of our new ASG product platform but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. Longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.  7  Ability to stay listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market On May 4, 2017, we received a notification letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) advising the Company that it has initiated proceedings to delist the Company from NASDAQ for the Company’s failure to comply with NASDAQ’s bid price rule. As previously reported on November 1, 2016, NASDAQ notified the Company that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than $1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, thus, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”).   The Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until May 1, 2017, to regain compliance with the Rule.    Additionally, the Company reported on February 8, 2017, that it received a notification letter from NASDAQ advising the Company of its failure to comply with the required minimum of either $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity, $35,000,000 market value of listed securities or $500,000 net income from continuing operations for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to NASDAQ listing rule 5550(b). NASDAQ listing rules provided the Company with 45 calendar days in which to submit a plan to regain compliance. The Company submitted a plan on March 24, 2017, and NASDAQ notified the Company on April 20, 2017 of NASDAQ’s acceptance of the plan and the granting of an extension through August 7, 2017; however, because the Company was not able to comply with the Rule, NASDAQ has determined that the Company is not eligible for a second 180 calendar day extension to comply with the Rule.   The Company may request an appeal of this determination or be scheduled for delisting; the Company appealed the determination before the NASDAQ deadline and attended a hearing on June 15, 2017. The Company is awaiting a determination from the hearing.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s plans to comply with the required bid price, minimum shareholders’ equity, market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations will be successful. There can also be no assurance that the Company’s appeal of the determination would be successful. If the Company’s Common Stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company expects that its Common Stock would be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on or about the same day.  Giga-tronics’ sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry We have a significant number of defense-related orders. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales.

However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future. Giga-tronics’ competition has greater resources Our instrument, oscillator and synthesizer products compete with Agilent/Keysight, Anritsu, and Rohde & Schwarz. All these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. Our ASG product is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes. Our new advanced signal generator product is extremely complex. Despite testing, our product has contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems when first introduced, when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.  Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management.

The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.  Impairment Loss on Capitalized Software Development Costs The Company has capitalized certain software development costs. These costs are amortized over the expected life of the product and evaluated each reporting period for impairment. The Company examines the possibility of recovering the book value of assets based on the future cash flow to be generated from the asset. It may be necessary to recognize impairment of such asset if insufficient cash flow is generated.  "
3,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2016-06-07,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Future liquidity is uncertain We incurred net losses of $4.1 million in fiscal 2016, and $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $24.0 million as of March 26, 2016.   Beginning in fiscal 2012, we invested substantially in the research and development of our new product line, ASG. We anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the ASG platform, but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. We also experienced delays in the development of features, orders, and shipments for the new ASG. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $3.0 million at March 28, 2015, to $1.8 million at March 26, 2016. The new Advanced Signal Generator product has now shipped to several customers, but potential delays in the development of features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to continue shipments in volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses. The losses in fiscal 2016 caused working capital restraints, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers.  These matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.   To address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” (Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan).  Customer orders and production of new product platform   We invested heavily in the development of our new ASG product platform but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. Longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.     7  Ability to stay listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market  Our Common Stock is current listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ has minimum requirements that a Company must meet in order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. These requirements include maintaining a minimum shareholders’ equity of $2.5 million. If our shareholders’ equity falls below $2.5 million, NASDAQ could delist us from the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our Common Stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our Common Stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our Common Stock could decrease. If our Common Stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we expect that our Common Stock would be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on or about the same day.  Giga-tronics’ sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry We have a significant number of defense-related orders. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Our product backlog has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. Giga-tronics’ markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards The market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity. Giga-tronics’ common stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, NASDAQ and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Sales of a significant volume of stock could result in a decline of our share price. Performance problems in Giga-tronics’ products or problems arising from the use of its products together with other vendors’ products may harm its business and reputation Products as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.  8  Giga-tronics’ competition has greater resources Our instrument, switch, oscillator and synthesizer products compete with Agilent/Keysight, Anritsu, and Rohde & Schwarz. All of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us. "

RISK FACTORS  Future liquidity is uncertain Based on current levels of sales and expenses, and based on management's forecast of operations in the near future, management believes that cash and cash equivalents remain adequate to meet current operating needs. The cash forecasts are based on projections that may or may not be realized, and therefore actual cash usage could be greater than projected. In this circumstance, the Company could encounter a need to obtain additional funds from outside sources. If such additional working capital is required, there are no assurances that such financing sources will be available on favorable terms to the Company, if at all.  Customer orders and production of new product platform The Company invested heavily in the development of its new product platform, the Advanced Signal Generation system. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 two customers accepted their initial units of the Advanced Signal Generation System. Longer than anticipated sales cycles in fiscal 2016, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.   8  Ability to stay listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market If the Company’s shareholders’ equity falls below $2.5 million, The Nasdaq Stock Market could delist the Company from The Nasdaq Capital Market. On February 20, 2015, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market informing the Company that a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) determined that the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), the minimum stockholders’ equity rule (the “Stockholders’ Equity Rule”). As a result, the Panel determined that the Company is in compliance with all applicable listing standards required for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and accordingly, the Panel has determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market. However, because the Company has met compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule by a relatively small margin, the Panel has imposed a Panel Monitor to monitor the Company’s continued compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule until February 27, 2016. The Company is under certain notification obligations during this time period, including the obligation to notify the Panel Monitor if it fails to comply with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule or any other applicable listing requirement.

5,GIGA,GIGA-TRONICS INC,2014-06-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Future liquidity is uncertain The Company incurred net losses of $3.7 million in fiscal 2014, and $4.2 million in fiscal 2013. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $18.3 million at March 29, 2014, and have resulted in the Company using cash in its operations of $2.5 million in fiscal 2014. These matters, along with recurring losses in prior years, raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  In fiscal 2014 and 2013 the Company invested heavily in the development of a new Giga-tronics Division product platform. The Company anticipates long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the new product platform, but delays in completing it have contributed to the losses of the Company. The new product platform is currently forecasted to start shipping in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, but further delays could cause additional losses.  To help fund operations, the Company relies on advances under its line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). However the SVB may terminate or suspend advances under the line of credit if SVB determines there has been a material adverse change in the Company’s general affairs, financial forecasts or general ability to repay. (see Note 15, Line of Credit).  To address this matter, the Company’s management has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns during fiscal 2014, and reduce the costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan).   7   Management believes that through the actions described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 2, Going Concern and Management’s Plan), the Company should have the necessary liquidity to continue its operations at least for the next twelve months, though no assurances can be made in this regard.  Delivery of new products in development The Company continues to invest heavily in the development of a new product platform forecasted to start shipping in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The Company anticipates long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the new product platform. No assurances can be made that the new product platform will be delivered to customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 or that there will be sufficient market acceptance of it.  Ability to stay listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market On February 12, 2014, the Company received a notification letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) advising the Company of its failure to comply with the required minimum of $2.5 million in shareholders’ equity for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to NASDAQ listing rule 5550(b)(1). The Company fell below the minimum requirement with reported shareholders’ equity of $2.0 million in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 28, 2013. NASDAQ stated in the February 12, 2014 letter that under the NASDAQ listing rules the Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. The Company submitted a plan on March 31, 2014. On April 10, 2014, the Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ advising the Company that an extension to August 11, 2014, had been granted to take the steps necessary to regain compliance with NASDAQ listing rule 5550(b)(1) and promptly thereafter to file a report describing the transaction or event enabling the company to satisfy the applicable requirement for continued listing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s plans to comply with the required minimum of $2.5 million in shareholders’ equity will be successful by August 11, 2014. If the Company’s Common Stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company expects that its Common Stock would be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on or about the same day. The market price of the Company’s Common Stock may be adversely affected if it ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.  Giga-tronics’ sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry Giga-tronics has a significant number of defense-related orders.

Giga-tronics is subject to various risks in connection with any future acquisitions. Such risks include, among other things, the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption of the Company’s business, the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the Company by the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into its product offerings, the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. No assurance can be given that any acquisition by Giga-tronics will or will not occur, that if an acquisition does occur, that it will not materially harm the Company or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the Company’s business. The Company currently contemplates that future acquisitions may involve the issuance of additional shares of common stock. Any such issuance may result in dilution to all Giga-tronics’ shareholders, and sales of such shares in significant volume by the shareholders of acquired companies may depress the price of its common stock. The Company has not made any acquisitions in the past several years.  "

RISK FACTORS  Business climate is volatile The recent financial crisis/recession and continued economic uncertainty represent a continued risk for the Company and has resulted in delays of orders and/or cancellations. Giga-tronics has a significant number of defense-related orders. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. The Company’s commercial product backlog has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance and the Company’s ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments and revenues could decline. On March 1, 2013 the Federal government process known as “Sequestration” went into effect requiring automatic, indiscriminate across-the-board budget cuts to government programs. Sequestration will likely impact the way in which the government chooses to spend its money, but the effect Sequestration may have on Giga-tronics is uncertain. Giga-tronics’ sales are substantially dependent on the wireless industry Giga-tronics sells directly or indirectly to customers and equipment manufacturers in the wireless industry. This industry continues to experience dramatic and rapid change.

In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement to raise approximately $858,000 additional capital as discussed in Note 15, Subsequent Events, which management anticipates will close in July 2013. The cash forecasts are based on projections that may or may not be realized, and therefore actual cash usage could be greater than projected. In this circumstance, to continue operating, the Company would be required to either: earn additional cash from operations; obtain additional debt; sell additional securities; and/or obtain additional funds from other sources. If such additional working capital is required, there are no assurances that such financing from debt or the sale of securities will be available on favorable terms to the Company, if at all. Giga-tronics’ common stock price is volatile The market price of the Company’s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by Giga-tronics or by competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights.

For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances.  In addition, Giga-tronics’ customers generally use its products together with their own products and products from other vendors.  As a result, when problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.  A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to Giga-tronics’ reputation generally.  To date, performance problems in Giga-tronics’ products or in other products used together with Giga-tronics’ products have not had a material adverse effect on its business.  However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.Giga-tronics competition has greater resourcesThe Company’s instrument, switch, oscillator and synthesizer products compete with Agilent, Anritsu, EADS, Aeroflex and Rohde & Schwarz.  Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological, personnel and managerial resources than Giga-tronics.  These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than the Company.  There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by Giga-tronics.Giga-tronics acquisitions may not be effectively integrated and their integration may be costlyAs part of its business strategy, Giga-tronics may broaden its product lines and expand its markets, in part through the acquisition of other business entities.  Giga-tronics is subject to various risks in connection with any future acquisitions.  Such risks include, among other things, the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption of the Company’s business, the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the Company by the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into its product offerings, the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.  The Company has not made any acquisitions in the past nine years.  No assurance can be given that any acquisition by Giga-tronics will or will not occur, that if an acquisition does occur, that it will not materially harm the Company or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the Company’s business.  The Company currently contemplates that future acquisitions may involve the issuance of additional shares of common stock.  Any such issuance may result in dilution to all Giga-tronics’ shareholders, and sales of such shares in significant volume by the shareholders of acquired companies may depress the price of its common stock"
