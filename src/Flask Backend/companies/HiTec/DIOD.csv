. Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report before you make any trading decisions regarding our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.  Summary RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak cannot be estimated at this time, but it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, our operating results and financial condition. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation and intellectual property litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may incur additional costs and face emerging risks associated environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors impacting our operations.   10 - Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have recourse against our suppliers, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results and financial condition. We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If our direct sales customers or our distributors’ customers do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates or foreign exchange exposure or our counterparties might not perform as agreed.We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt. Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan’s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of “conflict minerals” may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and operating results.  11 - Significant uncertainties related to changes in governmental policies and participation in international trading partnerships or economic unions currently exist, and, depending upon how such uncertainties are resolved, the changes could have a material adverse effect on us.Tariffs or other restrictions imposed by the United States Trade Representative may affect our operations in the U.S., may disrupt our activities in the U.S., may have an adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations and may encourage the independent development in China of products and electronic components that will compete with ours or displace our products and components, resulting in an adverse impact on our Chinese business.The U.K.’s exit from the European Union (“E.U.”) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. The distribution of any earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign income taxes, thus reducing our net income. We could be adversely affected by the compromise or theft of our technology, know-how, data or intellectual property or a requirement that we yield rights in technology, know-how, data stored in foreign jurisdictions or intellectual property that we use in such foreign jurisdictions.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt.  12 - Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt.GENERAL RISK FACTORS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results and financial condition. System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak cannot be estimated at this time, but it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States and other countries across the world (including countries where we maintain operations), and the duration, severity of its effects and ultimate impact to the world’s population and financial impact are currently unknown. National, state and local governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of ways including, without limitation, by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e., social distancing), ordering businesses to close or limit operations and ordering people to stay at home (i.e., shelter in place), and imposing travel restrictions (including quarantine requirements).Given these governmental actions, there is no assurance that we will be permitted to operate under every current or future government order or other restriction and in every location where we maintain operations and may be required to limit our operations at, or close, certain locations in the future. Any such long-term limitations or closures would have a material adverse impact on our ability to service our customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In particular, any long-term limitations on, or long-term closures of, our manufacturing facilities in Asia or Europe would have a negative adverse impact on our ability to manufacture, sell and ship products and service customers and would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the first quarter of 2020, following the extended Chinese New Year, we delayed the start of our manufacturing production in China and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 we temporarily closed our wafer fabrication facilities located in the United Kingdom. As of the date of this report, our operations in China and the United Kingdom have both resumed full production.  However, we can provide no assurances that those facilities or any of our other facilities may not suffer similar closures or disruptions in the future.While the Company has already experienced negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic to its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, in light of the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 we cannot reasonably estimate the total impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition at this time. Risks and complications in the Company’s business from COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, changes in ordering patterns and demand for our products and losses in efficiency due to travel limitations and regulations compelling employees to work from home.  While the Company has not experienced a material increase in technology spending, if employees are forced to continue working remotely it could become necessary to increase information technology spending.  Although the Company has not experienced a significant business disruption due to teleworking arrangements, the imposition of increased self-isolation protocols could negatively impact the ability of employees to travel to the Company’s production facilities and possibly create ongoing business disruptions.  The limitations could negatively affect the Company’s ability to produce, sell and transport its products.  The Company’s consolidated financial statements presented herein reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the Company’s goodwill, long-lived asset valuation and indefinite-lived intangible asset valuation; inventory valuation;  13 - equity investment valuation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; measurement of compensation cost for certain share-based awards and cash bonus plans; and pension plan assumptions. In addition, depending on the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare insurance premiums could increase, increasing our healthcare costs.In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause disruptions, and in some cases severe disruptions, to the business and operations of our suppliers and customers as a result of quarantines, worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors, social distancing measures and other travel, health-related, business or other restrictions.  Certain of our customers and suppliers may in the future be required to close down or operate at a lower capacity, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our customers could experience financial difficulties resulting in such customers being unable to pay for products they ordered from us before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. There can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will be offset by increased sales in the future.During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant net sales declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they affect the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  14 - The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability, technological innovation and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Infineon Technologies A.G., Nexperia, formerly the Standard Products business of NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve product performance and cost. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost net sales. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss of future net sales and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products.  Any disruption at any of our wafer fabrication facilities or assembly and test facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through design, product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers’ shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. Our net sales growth and profit margins will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers may require our products to undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. In addition, we are focusing more on the automotive and industrial markets. These markets, automotive in particular, require higher quality standards.  Although we are working to ensure our organization and products meet the more rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurances we will succeed.  Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the product’s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a requalification process, which may result in delayed net sales, foregone sales and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.  15 - In addition, from time to time, our customers may demand an audit of our records, product manufacturing, qualification, and packaging processes, business practices and other related items to verify that we have complied with our business obligations, standard processes and procedures, product specifications and certain governing laws and regulations related to our business practices, and in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of mutual business agreements.  If the audit shows any deficiency in any of these categories, our customers may require us to implement extensive protocols to remedy the deficiency, assess us significant penalties, refuse shipments of our products, return existing inventory, cancel orders, or terminate our business relationship, each of which will adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from immediate delivery to twelve months or more in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our net sales, operating results and financial condition may suffer. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on low pin count semiconductor devices with one or more active or passive components. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor supplier with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing costs and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:   •pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  •cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  16 -   •discontinue the use of infringing technology;  •expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  •pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  •license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  •relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. In some instances, a supplier may be our sole-source supplier.  Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs charged to us were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. In addition, we may be subject to quality claims from customers who purchased goods from companies before we acquired those companies.  Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are quality problems with the finished products we sell. From time to time, various suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may, in the future, choose not to supply products to us. If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, our operating results and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand our sales organization, manufacturing capacity, wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly and test operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:   •difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  •difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  •the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  •less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  •even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we may continue to source wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;  •difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  •difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, operating results and financial condition may suffer.  17 - Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc., (v) in 2012, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in 2012, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., (vii) in 2013, we acquired BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited  (viii) in 2015, we acquired Pericom Semiconductor Corporation, (vii) in 2019 we acquired Texas Instruments’ 200mm wafer fabrication facility and operations located in Greenock, Scotland and (viii) in November of 2020 we acquired LSC.  In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with: •unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  •delays in obtaining customer qualification of acquired facilities; •bringing the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  •coordinating our new product and process development;  •hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  •increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  •difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entity’s business;  •diversion of management’s attention from the management of our business; and  •adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation and intellectual property litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor, and intellectual property. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report for more information on our legal proceedings.  18 - We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur additional expenses related to any potential or alleged violation or environmental regulations, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected financial liabilities. We may incur additional costs and face emerging risks associated environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors impacting our operations. Stakeholders such as investors, employees and the communities in which we operate have increased their focus on our ESG and sustainability related activities, specifically in the corporate social and environmental responsibility (“CSER”) areas.  Some investors may use our ESG and sustainability related information as well as the ESG ratings and metrics to guide their investment strategies and measure our corporate performance.  Potential and current investors may decrease or withdraw investment, or alternatively increase investment in our competitors if our CSER performance is perceived to be less than our competitors’ CSER performance. The qualitative and quantitative criteria adopted or published by third party ESG rating agencies and standards organization may continue to evolve.  We may incur additional costs to satisfy these evolving expectations and criteria, and may face additional risks associated with emerging regulations governing CSER performances.  We may communicate certain goals and projects regarding our CSER activities from time to time.  If we are unable to meet those goals or are perceived to fail to meet the goals as planned, or if our CSER policies and practices are perceived to be inadequate, we could face reputational damages and our financial results may be adversely affected. Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have recourse against our suppliers, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results and financial condition. Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, are typically sold at prices that are an insignificant portion of the overall value of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a television may be sold for several cents, whereas the television maker might sell the television for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the net sales and profits we receive from the products involved and we may not have recourse against our suppliers. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer’s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our operating results and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. We may choose not to carry liability insurance, may not have sufficient insurance coverage, or may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possible warranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.  19 - We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial/executive personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly and test facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profitable growth, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If our direct sales customers or our distributors’ customers do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from direct sales customers, we would only be able to sell our products to these direct sales customers as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once a direct sales customer designs another supplier’s semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that direct sales customer’s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to a direct sales customer. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant net sales from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful or if the customer can obtain a superior product or the product at a lower cost from one of our competitors.  20 - We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We currently have a U.S. credit facility under which, as of December 31, 2020, we had a remaining principal balance of $282.3 million under a term loan, and had nothing drawn on a $150.0 million revolver, $150.0 million of which remained available as of December 31, 2020. In addition to our U.S. credit facility we have $140.6 million outstanding under short-term foreign credit facilities.  In addition to our U.S. credit facility and our short-term foreign credit facilities, our 51% owned subsidiary, ERIS Technology Corporation (“ERIS”), borrowed $30.0 million on a long-term basis from local Taiwan banks in order to make an investment.   See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. Based on our debt balances at December, 31, 2020, an increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% for the year on our credit facilities would increase or decrease our annual interest rate expense by less than $1.8 million, net of the amounts realized from our interest rate swaps.  Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates or foreign exchange exposure or our counterparties might not perform as agreed.We use interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. The hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt.  We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements on our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. As of December 31, 2020, $282.3 million was outstanding under our U.S. credit facility. In addition, we have short-term foreign credit facilities with borrowing capacities of approximately $307.1 million with an unused amount of $168.9 million.Our outstanding debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt agreements;  •resulting in one or more events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which events of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  •reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  •subjecting us to the risks of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements. Our U.S. credit facility and our foreign credit lines bear interest at LIBOR or similar indices plus a specified margin. In July 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  The cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of LIBOR has since been extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration until mid-2023.  In response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) to identify alternatives to LIBOR.  The ARRC has recommended benchmark- 21 - replacement procedures to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against LIBOR’s discontinuation.  The initial steps in the ARRC’s recommended provision reference variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR.  At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement.  All of our existing debt obligations that are based on LIBOR will mature by the end of 2023, but in anticipation of LIBOR’s phase out, our U.S. credit facility (which matures May 29, 2023) was amended to provide for alternative benchmark rates (including a hard-wired SOFR-based alternative benchmark) as well as transition mechanisms for selecting another benchmark replacement rate for LIBOR, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the lenders under the U.S. credit facility.  We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur.  Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. Our U.S. credit facility contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases), issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from our credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. Our U.S. credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the U.S. credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the facility. An event of default under the facility would permit the lenders under the facility to declare all amounts owed under such facility to be immediately due and payable in full. Upon acceleration of our indebtedness, we may be unable to repay the accelerated amount of principal and interest on the credit facilities that would then be due. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition-Debt instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai and Chengdu, China, in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise (“HNTE”) status. One of our manufacturing facilities and one of our wafer fabrication facilities located in Shanghai are approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2018-2020. The Company expected to continue to meet HTND requirements s in future years. HNTE qualification requires, but is not limited to, metrics based on China research and development expenditures as well as research and development headcount and overall college-degreed headcount.  Any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audit requirements. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for our approved Shanghai facilities would increase to 23% for any period in which an audit shows we were not compliant, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In connection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, with Ya Guang, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (“Go West”), where companies are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15% for doing business in western China. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition since we own 98% of this joint venture entity. 22 - The impact of our HNTE and Go West status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our tax expense by approximately $0.9 million, $3.1 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $0.02, $0.06 and $0.03, respectively.We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan’s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. The assets of our defined benefit pension plan (the “plan”) in the U.K. provide pensions to employees and former employees.  The plan’s assets are invested in a diverse range of listed and unlisted securities, including corporate bonds and mutual funds and are determined, from time to time, based on their fair market value.  The plan’s obligation to pay pensions is estimated by using actuarial assumptions. To the extent that the plan’s assets are not sufficient to meet the estimated amount of the plan’s obligations, further funding of the plan will be required by the plan’s sponsoring employers, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, over an agreed upon deficit recovery period.As of December 31, 2020, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $175.3 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $147.9 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $27.4 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the U.K. equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding, (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost, and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.The trustees under the plan are required to review the plan’s funding position every three years. The pension plan funding valuation as at March 31, 2019 resulted in a deficit of approximately GBP 26.7 million (approximately $34.7 million based on a GBP: USD exchange rate of 1:1.3). As a result of this valuation we agreed to a revised schedule of contributions of GBP 2.0 million (approximately $2.6 million based on a GBP: USD exchange rate of 1:1.3) to be paid in annual installments with effect from April 1,  23 - 2020 to address the deficit revealed by the valuation (with the first payment to be made by March 31, 2021, and payments to be made by December 31 each year thereafter). These contributions, together with the assumed asset outperformance, are expected to eliminate the deficit by December 31, 2028. Further, we will pay GBP 0.2 million in annual installments effective April 1, 2020 to cover plan expenses. Moving the recovery plan from a 2030 deadline to a 2029 deadline could require us to increase our plan contributions.  If we fail to reach an agreement with the plan trustees, as we are required to do every three years, the pension regulator in the U.K. could impose contributions on Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, or in limited circumstances could require financial support to be provided to the plan from entities connected or associated with Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited. Furthermore, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited remain ultimately liable to fully fund the plan regardless of any failure to agree upon future contributions in respect of a particular actuarial valuation, i.e., if either the plan or those companies were wound up, a debt equal to each company’s share of the entire outstanding deficit at that time (calculated on a statutory conservative basis) would be owed by the relevant company. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.   Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and operating results. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers’ codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of “conflict minerals” may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. These requirements affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We are incurring additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. This requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict-free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our management’s attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future.  24 - If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in China. For the twelve months ended 2020 our Asian and European subsidiaries represented approximately 78% of our net sales, while in 2019 and 2018, our Asian and European subsidiaries represented over 77% and 85%, respectively, of our net sales. The decline of net sales in our Asia and European based subsidiaries beginning in 2019 represents a shift in business practices to fulfill more orders from our non-Asia based subsidiaries. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:  •changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including income tax or value added tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;  •compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  •trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  •changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  •difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;  •currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;  •the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;  •legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  •longer customer payment terms; and  •changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions’ laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, including, but not limited to income tax and value added tax, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our operating results and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high  25 - degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. Significant uncertainties related to changes in governmental policies and participation in international trading partnerships or economic unions currently exist, and, depending upon how such uncertainties are resolved, the changes could have a material adverse effect on us.Changes to existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, greater restrictions on international trade generally and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop, manufacture and sell products, and any negative reactions towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, negative sentiments towards the U.S. among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect our international sales or the hiring and retention of qualified employees, respectively.The United Kingdom exit from the European Union has also created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the European Union, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business and operations in the U.K. the European Union, and worldwide could be materially adversely affected by the U.K. exit. Future events as a consequence of the U.K. exit, including stresses within the U.K. itself, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including global currency and debt markets, and may result in a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by new or revised trade agreements between countries in which we have operations or do business, including the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and China, as well as by the possible impositions of tariffs or trade or other regulatory barriers by any nation where we have operations or do business. Tariffs or other restrictions imposed by the United States Trade Representative may affect our operations in the U.S., may disrupt our activities in the U.S., may have an adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations and may encourage the independent development in China of products and electronic components that will compete with ours or displace our products and components, resulting in an adverse impact on our business in China.In May 2019, at the direction of the President of the United States, the United States increased the level of tariffs from 10% to 25% on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The President also ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion. These tariffs are in addition to the new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from China in response to what the U.S. characterizes as unfair trade practices. China responded to the earlier increased tariffs by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States.  Negotiations between the U.S. and China to resolve the issues that precipitated the impositions of these tariffs are reported to be ongoing, but the situation is dynamic and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution is currently uncertain. In June 2019, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed that they did not plan more tariffs against each other’s countries, but on August 1, 2019, President Trump announced that on September 1, 2019, the U.S. would put an additional tariff of 10% on $300 billion of goods and products coming from China to the U.S. On August 23, 2019, in response to China announcing additional tariffs on U.S. products, President Trump instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to increase by 5% the tariffs on approximately $550 billion worth of Chinese imports to the U.S. This would have increased the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, effective October 1, 2019 to 30% and raised the tariff rate to 15% on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports previously announced, but on September 11, 2019 President Trump announced that the effective date would be extended to October 15, 2019 as “a gesture of goodwill.” On October 12, 2019, President Trump announced that the U.S. would halt the October 15, 2019 tariff increase after positive negotiations with the China representatives in Washington, D.C.  On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed a Phase One trade deal pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. agreed to modify its Section 301 tariff actions (described in this risk factor) in a significant way. On December 31, 2020, a majority of the previously imposed tariff exclusions expired resulting in an increase in the taxes paid by US companies on imports of many products from China.  In addition, in December 2020, then President-Elect Joe Biden publicly stated that he was not planning to make immediate moves with respect to tariffs.  Given the change in power in the U.S. government in January 2021, significant uncertainty remains regarding tariffs and their impact on our Company as President Biden’s administration begins to implement new or revised U.S.-China trade policies.   Most of our products are manufactured in China and then a portion of those products are imported into the U.S. The impacts on us of the recently imposed and proposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. We have taken actions, and may take additional steps, to mitigate those impacts and protect our competitive position in the marketplace.  If we determine to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to our  26 - customers, the result may be a degradation of our competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect our operating performance. It is not clear at this time what the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions and our mitigation efforts will be, but given the importance of our Chinese operations and related sales, and the impacts of existing and possible future restrictions with regard to transactions with Chinese entities, it is very possible that our operating results and/or financial condition may be adversely affected.On August 25, 2019, President Trump advised American companies to seek alternatives to China for the manufacture of their products, citing the U.S. “International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977” as a possible basis for applying a sanction of this sort. Given the inauguration of Mr. Biden as President of the United States in January 2021, it is not clear when, whether or in what form, this threat will be put into action, but if it does materialize our results of operations and financial condition likely will be materially adversely affected.In addition to the ongoing issues regarding tariffs, China has been stepping up efforts to design and manufacture semiconductors itself rather than buy from U.S. companies, amid fears that sanctions might cripple its high-tech industry. U.S. restrictions on exports to Chinese telecoms equipment makers have sharpened Beijing’s focus on semiconductor self-sufficiency. China’s ministry of finance announced tax breaks “to support the development of integrated circuit design and the software industry,” cancelling corporate taxes for some domestic Chinese companies for two years. Although the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, the development of such capacity in China would likely have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.The U.K.’s exit from the European Union (“E.U.”) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020.  The U.K.’s exit from the E.U. is to be followed by an 11-month transition period to allow the U.K. and the E.U. to finalize new trade, security, data, fishing and transport policies to shape their new relationship. The impacts of the implementation of Brexit and the resulting relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. The U.K. vote impacted global markets, including various currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies.  The fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. Volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the U.K. and the E.U. finalize the new trade, security data, fishing and transport policies. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Continuing weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in mainland China. In addition, in 2020 approximately 53% of our total sales were shipped to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”), China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and we have no third party attestation to the effectiveness of our internal controls related to fraud and corruption. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  27 - We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our operating results. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and operating results as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially if the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We have taken, and plan to continue to take, efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in countries in which we conduct sales, acquire raw materials, build products and make capital investments, but these efforts may not be successful. In this regard, these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business, do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover, and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk.China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receive preferential tax treatment. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income.The distribution of any earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign income taxes, thus reducing our net income. Our undistributed foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, with limited exceptions related to earnings of European and Asian subsidiaries.  Any future distributions of foreign earnings will not be subject to additional U.S. income tax, but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2020, we had undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $1.6 billion (including approximately $287 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Undistributed earnings of our China subsidiaries comprise $469 million of this total.  Additional Chinese withholding taxes of approximately $45 million would be required should the $469 million of such earnings be distributed out of China as dividends. We could be adversely affected by the compromise or theft of our technology, know-how, data or intellectual property or a requirement that we yield rights in technology, know-how, data stored in foreign jurisdictions or intellectual property that we use in such foreign jurisdictions.In general, we rely on the intellectual property and unfair competition laws and contractual restrictions to protect our technology, know-how, data and intellectual property in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our technology, know-how, data and other intellectual property rights are important to our success. Any unauthorized use of our technology, know-how, data and other intellectual property rights could harm our competitive advantages and business. For example, some jurisdictions have not protected intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States, and infringement of intellectual property rights continues to pose a serious risk of doing business in such jurisdictions. The measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Furthermore, the application of laws governing intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions is uncertain and evolving, and could involve substantial risks to us. Infringement of our patents or required technology or know-how transfers to  28 - foreign entities could create competition for us, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our longer-term profitability and success. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:   •strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  •general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;  •seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  •the timing of our and our competitors’ new product introductions;  •product obsolescence;  •the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  •the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers’ products;  •our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  •changes in manufacturing yields;  •adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  •the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investors and our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. General or industry-specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report, we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. From time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:   •use a significant portion of our available cash;  •issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership;  •incur substantial debt;  •incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  •incur amortization expenses related to intangibles;  •incur large, immediate accounting write-offs;  •incur substantial expense and diversion of management attention, regardless of the success of the acquisition; and •create goodwill and other intangible assets that may require impairment charges in the future.Such actions by us could harm our operating results and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. 29 - Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 19% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2020. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents since being formed. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the SEC to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the market price of our Common Stock. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an “interested stockholder,” which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i)   either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; (ii)  the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or (iii)  the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholder’s proportionate share ownership in the corporation. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to  30 - render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. GENERAL RISK FACTORS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our net sales, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events, including epidemics (such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus) and related travel restrictions,. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause our customers to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the Internet generally. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and related customer issues), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition and could result in material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls.  31 -  Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in China, the U.S. and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might negatively affect our future operating results and financial condition. System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or those of third parties, create system disruptions, compromise physical assets or intellectual property, or misappropriate monetary assets or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our websites or exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and information systems. Our international operations and business relationships could exacerbate these potential risks. In September 2019, our anti-virus defenses identified a malware infection and brute force password attack. Breach resolution was accomplished by our internal IT staff. We do not believe that any confidential or proprietary information was exposed or that there was any material impact on production. In response to this cyber-intrusion, we engaged an information technology security company to assess the timetable and scope of the intrusion, identify any weaknesses in our IT systems, and assist in designing security measures to strengthen our protection against, and preparation for identifying and responding to, such attacks. We are reviewing this assessment and have enhanced and continue to enhance our security measures. Specific measures we have taken include strengthening our global network access control to further prevent unauthorized or non-compliant devices from accessing our internal networks and developing policies and procedures to more timely respond to intrusions.`The costs to the Company to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our ongoing efforts to prevent and address these problems may not be successful.  Such problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, extortionate demands to decrypt files and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions and materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation.We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss, encryption or disclosure of such information or data or the unauthorized transfer of monetary assets as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, extortionate demands to decrypt files, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation.Cyber and other security problems could originate from within the United States or in foreign countries.  Our foreign operations expose us to additional cyber security risks compared to a company with a smaller international footprint.  32 -  "

. Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report before you make any trading decisions regarding our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our net sales, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant net sales declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they affect the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. - 10 -The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability, technological innovation and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Infineon Technologies A.G., Nexperia, formerly the Standard Products business of NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. One of our external suppliers is also a related party. The loss of this supplier could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for less than 3% of our silicon wafer supply and our finished goods supply. The loss of LSC as a supplier could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve product performance and cost. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost net sales. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss of future net sales and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products.  Any disruption at any of our wafer fabrication facilities or assembly and test facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through design, product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers’ shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. Our net sales growth and profit margins will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. - 11 -Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers may require our products to undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. In addition, we are focusing more on the automotive and industrial markets. These markets, automotive in particular, require higher quality standards.  Although we are working to ensure our organization and products meet the more rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurances we will succeed.  Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the product’s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a requalification process, which may result in delayed net sales, foregone sales and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, our customers may demand an audit of our records, product manufacturing, qualification, and packaging processes, business practices and other related items to verify that we have complied with our business obligations, standard processes and procedures, product specifications and certain governing laws and regulations related to our business practices, and in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of mutual business agreements.  If the audit shows any deficiency in any of these categories, our customers may require us to implement extensive protocols to remedy the deficiency, assess us significant penalties, refuse shipments of our products, return existing inventory, cancel orders, or terminate our business relationship, each of which will adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from immediate delivery to twelve months or more in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our net sales, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause our customers to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. - 12 -New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on low pin count semiconductor devices with one or more active or passive components. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor supplier with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing costs and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the Internet generally. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and related customer issues), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition and could result in material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls. - 13 -We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:   •pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  •cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  •discontinue the use of infringing technology;  •expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  •pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  •license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  •relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. In some instances, a supplier may be our sole-source supplier.  Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs charged to us were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. In addition, we may be subject to quality claims from customers who purchased goods from companies before we acquired those companies.  Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are quality problems with the finished products we sell. From time to time, various suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may, in the future, choose not to supply products to us. - 14 -If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, our operating results and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand our sales organization, manufacturing capacity, wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly and test operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:   •difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  •difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  •the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  •less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  •even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we may continue to source wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;  •difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  •difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc., (v) in 2012, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in 2012, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., (vii) in 2013, we acquired BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited and (viii) in 2015, we acquired Pericom Semiconductor Corporation. Also, in February 2019 we announced the proposed acquisition of Texas Instruments’ 200mm wafer fabrication facility and operations located in Greenock, Scotland, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:   •unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  •delays in obtaining customer qualification of acquired facilities; •bringing the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  •coordinating our new product and process development;  •hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  •increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  •difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entity’s business;  •diversion of management’s attention from the management of our business; and - 15 - •adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation and intellectual property litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor, and intellectual property. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report for more information on our legal proceedings. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur additional expenses related to any potential or alleged violation or environmental regulations, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable.  For example, as described under Part I., Item 1. “Business, Environmental Matters,” in this Annual Report, in August 2018, the Company received a letter from the EPA concerning potential violations under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which do not involve any actual discharge of materials into the environment, arising as a result of an inspection at KFAB.  In February 2019, we fully resolved this matter with the EPA and paid approximately $0.2 million. During 2018 we received notice from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment of possible environmental law violations at BCD.  The notice stated that we installed and used environmental protection devices at our plant, prior to final approval from the authorities.  We paid approximately $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 to settle the matter.Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected financial liabilities. - 16 -Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have recourse against our suppliers, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results and financial condition. Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, are typically sold at prices that are an insignificant portion of the overall value of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a television may be sold for several cents, whereas the television maker might sell the television for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the net sales and profits we receive from the products involved and we may not have recourse against our suppliers. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer’s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our operating results and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. We may choose not to carry liability insurance, may not have sufficient insurance coverage, or may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possible warranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial/executive personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly and test facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profitable growth, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. - 17 -If our direct sales customers do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from direct sales customers, we would only be able to sell our products to these direct sales customers as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once a direct sales customer designs another supplier’s semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that direct sales customer’s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to a direct sales customer. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant net sales from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful or if the customer can obtain a superior product or the product at a lower cost from one of our competitors. We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We currently have a U.S. banking credit facility under which as of December 31, 2018, we had a remaining principal balance of $124.5 million under a term loan, and had drawn $85.5 million on a $250.0 million revolver ($164.5 million of which remained available as of December 31, 2018), with the possibility of an additional $200.0 million of borrowings.  In addition to our U.S. banking credit facility we have $10.3 million outstanding under foreign credit facilities.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. Based on our debt balances at December, 31, 2018, an increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% for the year on our credit facilities would increase or decrease our annual interest rate expense by less than $1.0 million, net of the amounts realized from our interest rate swaps.  Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates or foreign exchange exposure or our counterparties might not perform as agreed.We use interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. The hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt.  We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements on our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. As of December 31, 2018, $210.0 million was outstanding under our U.S. banking credit facility. In addition, we have short-term foreign credit facilities with borrowing capacities of approximately $123.2 million with an unused amount of $112.5 million.A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;  •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  •reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  •subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. - 18 -Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt. Our U.S. Credit Facility and our foreign credit lines bear interest at LIBOR or similar indices plus a specified margin. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, and if the U.S. Credit Facility is not amended to incorporate an alternate benchmark rate to replace LIBOR once such an alternate benchmark rate has been identified, the interest rates under the U.S. Credit Facility will be based on the Base Rate (as defined in the U.S. Credit Facility), which may result in higher interest rates.  The U.S. Credit Facility provides a streamlined mechanism for amendment to its interest rate provisions in the event LIBOR becomes unavailable that would permit substitution of an alternate benchmark rate by agreement between the Company and the Administrative Agent, subject only to rejection by a majority of the lenders under the U.S. Credit Facility.  However, such an amendment would depend upon the identification of an alternate benchmark rate, and agreement between the Company and the Administrative Agent on the alternate benchmark rate and on terms for incorporation of that alternate benchmark rate into the U.S. Credit Facility.  If an alternate benchmark rate is not agreed under the U.S. Credit Facility and/or if an alternate benchmark rate is not available under our foreign credit lines, interest rates governing such indebtedness may increase.  To the extent that these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. Our U.S. banking credit facility contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases), issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. Our U.S. banking credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the U.S. banking credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the facility. An event of default under the facility would permit the lenders under the facility to declare all amounts owed under such facility to be immediately due and payable in full. Upon acceleration of our indebtedness, we may be unable to repay the accelerated amount of principal and interest on the credit facilities that would then be due. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition-Debt instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai and Chengdu, China, in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise (“HNTE”) status. One of our Shanghai manufacturing facilities has been approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2018-2020. In addition, two of our wafer fabrication facilities and one research and development facility located in Shanghai were approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2017-2019. HNTE qualification requires, but is not limited to, metrics based on China research and development expenditures as well as research and development headcount and overall college-degreed headcount.  Any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audit requirements. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for our approved Shanghai assembly and test facility and wafer fabrication facility would increase to 25% for any period in which an audit shows we were not compliant, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In connection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, with Ya Guang, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (“Go West”), where companies are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15% for doing business in western China. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition since we own 98% of this joint venture entity.- 19 -The impact of our HNTE and Go West status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our tax expense by approximately $1.6 million, $3.7 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $0.03, $0.08 and $0.15, respectively.We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan’s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. The assets of our defined benefit pension plan (the “plan”) in the U.K. provide pensions to employees and former employees.  The plan’s assets are invested in a diverse range of listed and unlisted securities, including corporate bonds and mutual funds and are determined, from time to time, based on their fair market value.  The plan’s obligation to pay pensions is estimated by using actuarial assumptions. To the extent that the plan’s assets are not sufficient to meet the estimated amount of the plan’s obligations, further funding of the plan will be required by the plan’s sponsoring employers, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, over an agreed upon deficit recovery period.As of December 31, 2018, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $141.1 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $117.2 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $23.9 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the U.K. equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding, (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost, and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.  - 20 -During the first quarter of 2015, we agreed to a payment plan with the trustees of the defined benefit plan, under which we would make annual contributions each year through 2030, of approximately 2 million British Pounds (“GBP”) (approximately $2.6 million based on a GBP:USD exchange rate of 1.27, effective at December 31, 2018).  The annual contributions were expected to meet the deficit disclosed in the plan as of April 5, 2013, by December 31, 2030.  The trustees are required to review the funding position every three years, and a further review was carried out as of April 5, 2016 and the next review scheduled for April 2019. The outcome of the review, as agreed to with the trustees during the first quarter of 2017, was that contributions would continue at the existing level, up to December 31, 2029.  If we fail to reach an agreement with the trustees, as we are required to do every three years, the Pension Regulator in the U.K. could impose contributions on Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, or in limited circumstances could require financial support to be provided to the plan from entities connected or associated with Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited. Furthermore, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited remain ultimately liable to fully fund the plan regardless of any failure to agree upon future contributions in respect of a particular actuarial valuation, i.e., if either the plan or those companies were wound up, a debt equal to each company’s share of the entire outstanding deficit at that time (calculated on a statutory conservative basis) would be owed by the relevant company. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.  Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and operating results. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers’ codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of “conflict minerals” may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. These requirements affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We are incurring additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. This requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict-free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our management’s attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. - 21 -If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in China, the U.S. and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might negatively affect our future operating results and financial condition. System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, compromise physical assets, intellectual property, or misappropriate monetary assets or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our websites or exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and information systems. In 2016 the Company became aware of an attempted cyber-intrusion, as part of our third-party network penetration test.  In response to this attempted cyber-intrusion we engaged an information technology security company to assess the scope of the attempted intrusion and to assist in designing security measures to strengthen our protection against such attacks. We completed the assessment and have enhanced and continue to enhance our security measures. These efforts continue. At this time we have no reason to believe the cyber-intruder obtained any confidential or propriety information. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our ongoing efforts to prevent and address these problems may not be successful. Specific measures we have taken are focused on identifying and protecting against advanced and emerging security threats thereby leveraging intelligence from an extensive global data security network. In addition, we strengthened our global network access control to further prevent unauthorized or non-compliant devices from accessing our internal networks. The costs to the Company to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our ongoing efforts to prevent and address these problems may not be successful.  Such problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, extortionate demands to decrypt files and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions and materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation.- 22 -We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss, encryption or disclosure of such information or data or the unauthorized transfer of monetary assets as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, extortionate demands to decrypt files, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in China. In each of the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Asian and European subsidiaries represented over 85% of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:  •changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including income tax or value added tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;  •compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  •trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  •changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  •difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;  •currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;  •the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;  •legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  •longer customer payment terms; and  •changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In addition, in February 2019, we announced the proposed acquisition of Texas Instruments’ 200mm wafer fabrication facility and operations located in Greenock, Scotland.  Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions’ laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, including, but not limited to income tax and value added tax, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our operating results and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits.  - 23 -Significant uncertainties related to changes in governmental policies and participation in international trading partnerships or economic unions currently exist, and, depending upon how such uncertainties are resolved, the changes could have a material adverse effect on us.Changes to existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, greater restrictions on international trade generally and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop, manufacture and sell products, and any negative reactions towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, negative sentiments towards the U.S. among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect our international sales or the hiring and retention of qualified employees, respectively.The United Kingdom referendum to exit the European Union has also created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the European Union, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business in the U.K. the European Union, and worldwide could be adversely affected during this period of uncertainty, and, depending upon developments following completion of the U.K. exit, may materially adversely affect our business and operations. Future events as a consequence of the U.K. exit, including stresses within the U.K. itself, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including global currency and debt markets, and result in a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by new or revised trade agreements between countries in which we have operations or do business, including the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and China, as well as by the possible impositions of tariffs or trade or other regulatory barriers by any nation where we have operations or do business. Tariffs or other restrictions imposed by the United States Trade Representative may affect our operations in the U.S. and may disrupt our activities in the U.S. and may have an adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.The U.S. government has recently imposed additional new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from China in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. The U.S. government also proposed higher tariffs beginning on January 1, 2019. China responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States.  In December 2018, the U.S. government and Chinese government agreed to a 90-day truce on implementing the proposed tariffs.Most of our products are manufactured in China and then a portion of those products are imported into the U.S. The impacts on us of the recently imposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. We have taken actions, and may take additional steps, to mitigate those impacts and protect our competitive position in the marketplace.  If we determine to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to our customers, the result may be a degradation of our competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect our operating performance. It is not clear at this time what the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions and our mitigation efforts will be, but given the importance of our Chinese operations and related sales, and the impacts of existing and possible future restrictions with regard to transactions with Chinese entities, it is very possible that our operating results and/or financial condition may be adversely affected.The U.K.’s referendum to exit from the European Union (“E.U.”) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. is currently scheduled to exit the E.U. on March 29, 2019. The impacts of the implementation of Brexit and the resulting relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. The U.K. vote impacted global markets, including various currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies.  The fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. Volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.- 24 -A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Continuing weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in mainland China. In addition, in 2018 approximately 55% of our total sales were shipped to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”), China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and we have no third party attestation to the effectiveness of our internal controls related to fraud and corruption. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our operating results. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and operating results as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially if the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We have taken, and plan to continue to take, efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in countries in which we conduct sales, acquire raw materials, build products and make capital investments, but these efforts may not be successful. In this regard, these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business, do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover, and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk.China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial - 25 -increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receive preferential tax treatment. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income. The distribution of any earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign income taxes, thus reducing our net income. As a result of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017, all of our undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings immediately became subject to U.S. income tax.  We had not previously accrued U.S. taxes on these earnings, due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting the earnings overseas.  Refer to the U.S. Tax Reform section in Item 7 and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section in Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for further discussion.  Our undistributed foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, with limited exceptions related to earnings of European and Asian subsidiaries.  Any future distributions of foreign earnings will not be subject to additional U.S. income tax, but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2018, we had undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $742 million (including approximately $55 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Undistributed earnings of our China subsidiaries comprise $381 million of this total.  Additional Chinese withholding taxes of approximately $37 million would be required should the $381 million of such earnings be distributed out of China as dividends. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:   •strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  •general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;  •seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  •the timing of our and our competitors’ new product introductions;  •product obsolescence;  •the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  •the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers’ products;  •our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  •changes in manufacturing yields;  •adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  •the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investors and our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. General or industry-specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report, we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. - 26 -We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. From time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:   •use a significant portion of our available cash;  •issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership;  •incur substantial debt;  •incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  •incur amortization expenses related to intangibles;  •incur large, immediate accounting write-offs;  •incur substantial expense and diversion of management attention, regardless of the success of the acquisition; and •create goodwill and other intangible assets that may require impairment charges in the future.Such actions by us could harm our operating results and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 22% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2018. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 15.5% (approximately 7.8 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation (“LTC”), a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H. Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and a board member of LTC. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, a member of our Board of Directors and our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a board member of LTC and a board member of Nuvoton. Several of our directors and executive officers may own LSC common stock or hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, LSC accounted for less than 3% of our silicon wafer supply and our finished good’s supply. We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents since being formed. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. - 27 -Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the SEC to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the market price of our Common Stock. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an “interested stockholder,” which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i)   either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; (ii)  the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or (iii)  the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholder’s proportionate share ownership in the corporation. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise"
8,DIOD,DIODES INC,2017-02-27,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
. Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A - 9 -decline in end-user demand can affect our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our net sales, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant net sales declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they affect the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability, technological innovation and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Infineon Technologies A.G., Nexperia, formerly the Standard Products business of NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. One of our external suppliers is also a related party. The loss of this supplier could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for approximately 1%-3% of our silicon wafer supply and our finished goods supply. The loss of LSC as a supplier could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. - 10 -Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve product performance and cost. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost net sales. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss of future net sales and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products.  Any disruption at any of our wafer fabrication facilities or assembly and test facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers’ shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. Our net sales growth and profit margins will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers may require our products to undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. In addition, we are focusing more on the automotive and industrial markets. These markets, automotive in particular, require higher quality standards.  Although we are working to ensure our organization and products meet the more rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurances we will succeed.  Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the product’s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a re-qualification process, which may result in delayed net sales and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, our customers may demand an audit of our records, product manufacturing, qualification, and packaging processes, business practices and other related items to verify that we have complied with our business obligations, standard processes and procedures, product specifications and certain governing laws and regulations related to our business practices, and in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of mutual business agreements.  If the audit shows any deficiency in any of these categories, our customers may require us to implement extensive protocols to remedy the deficiency, assess us significant penalties, refuse shipments of our products, return existing inventory, cancel orders, or terminate our business relationship, each of which will adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from immediate delivery to twelve months or more in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or - 11 -no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our net sales, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on low pin count semiconductor devices with one or more active or passive components. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor supplier with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing costs and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business - 12 -increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and related customer issues), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition and could result in material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:   •pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  •cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  •discontinue the use of infringing technology;  •expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  •pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  •license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  •relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. In some instances, a supplier may be our sole-source supplier.  Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs charged to us were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. In addition, we may be subject to quality claims from customers who purchased goods from companies before we acquired those companies.  Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are quality problems with the finished products we sell. From time to time, various suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or - 13 -increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may, in the future, choose not to supply products to us. If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, our operating results and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand our sales organization, manufacturing capacity, wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly and test operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:   •difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  •difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  •the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  •less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  •even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we may continue to source wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;  •difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  •difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc., (v) in 2012, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in 2012, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., (vii) in 2013, we acquired BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited and (viii) in 2015, we acquired Pericom Semiconductor Corporation. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:   •unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  •bringing the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  •coordinating our new product and process development;  •hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  •increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  •difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entity’s business;  •diversion of management’s attention from the management of our business; and  •adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. - 14 -We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor, and intellectual property. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report for more information on our legal proceedings. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected financial liabilities. Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results and financial condition. Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, are typically sold at prices that are an insignificant portion of the overall value of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a television may be sold for several cents, whereas the television maker might sell the television for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the net sales and profits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the - 15 -countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer’s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our operating results and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. We may choose not to carry liability insurance, may not have sufficient insurance coverage, or may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possible warranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial/executive personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly and test facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profitable growth, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another supplier’s semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEM’s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant net sales from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful or if the customer can obtain a superior product or the product at a lower cost from one of our competitors. We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  - 16 -We currently have a U.S. banking credit facility under which as of December 31, 2016 we had borrowed $250.0 million under a term loan, and had drawn $181.5 million on a $250.0 million revolver ($68.5 million of which remained available as of December 31, 2016), with the possibility of an additional $200.0 million of borrowings.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. As of December 31, 2016, an increase of 1% in interest rates on our outstanding debt would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $2.8 million. Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates or our counterparties might not perform as agreed. We use interest rate swaps to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. The hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to the interest rate swaps.We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt.  We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements on our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. As of December 31, 2016 $428.4 million was outstanding under our U.S. banking credit facility. In addition, we have short-term foreign credit facilities with borrowing capacities of approximately $66.5 million and with $0.5 million used for import and export guarantees. We have approximately $1.5 million of foreign long-term debt.  A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;  •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  •reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  •subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.  Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. Our U.S. banking credit facility contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases), issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. Our U.S. banking credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. - 17 -Our ability to comply with the U.S. banking credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the facility. An event of default under the facility would permit the lenders under the facility to declare all amounts owed under such facility to be immediately due and payable in full. Upon acceleration of our indebtedness, we may be unable to repay the accelerated amount of principal and interest on the credit facilities that would then be due. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition-Debt instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai and Chengdu, China, in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise (“HNTE”) status. One of our Shanghai manufacturing facilities has been approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2015-2017. In addition, one of our wafer fabrication facilities and one research and development facility located in Shanghai were approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2014-2016. HNTE qualification requires metrics based on China research and development expenditures as well as research and development headcount and overall college-degreed headcount.  Any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audit requirements. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for our approved Shanghai assembly and test facility and wafer fabrication facility would increase to 25% for any period in which an audit shows we were not compliant, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In connection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (“Go West”), where companies are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15% for doing business in western China. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The impact of our HNTE and Go West status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our tax expense by approximately $7.3 million, $2.9 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $0.15. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for both twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $0.06 and $0.05, respectively.We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of - 18 -each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan’s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. The assets of our defined benefit pension plan (the “plan”) in the U.K. provide pensions to employees and former employees.  The plan’s assets are invested in a diverse range of listed and unlisted securities, including corporate bonds and, mutual funds and are determined, from time to time, based on their fair market value.  The plan’s obligation to pay pensions is estimated by using actuarial assumptions. To the extent that the plan’s assets are not sufficient to meet the estimated amount of the plan’s obligations, further funding of the plan will be required by the plan’s sponsoring employers, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, over an agreed upon deficit recovery period.As of December 31, 2016, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $146.8 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $118.7 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $28.1 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the U.K. equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding, (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost, and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.           During the first quarter of 2015, we agreed to a payment plan with the trustees of the defined benefit plan, under which we would make annual contributions each year through 2030, of approximately 2 million British Pounds (“GBP”) (approximately $2.4 million based on a GBP:USD exchange rate of 1.2).  The annual contributions were expected to meet the deficit disclosed in the plan as of April 5, 2013, by December 31, 2030.  The trustees are required to review the funding position every three years, and a further review was carried out as of April 5, 2016. The outcome of the review, as agreed to with the trustees during the first quarter of 2017, was that contributions would continue at the existing level, up to December 31, 2029.  If we fail to reach an agreement with the trustees, as we are required to do every three years, the Pension Regulator in the U.K. could impose contributions on Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, or in limited circumstances could require financial support to be provided to the plan from entities connected or associated with Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited. Furthermore, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited remain ultimately liable to fully fund the plan regardless of any failure to agree upon future contributions in respect of a particular actuarial valuation, i.e., if either the plan or those companies were wound up, a debt equal to each company’s share of the entire outstanding deficit at that time (calculated on a statutory conservative basis) would be owed by the relevant company. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.  Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and operating results. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers’ codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. - 19 -Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of “conflict minerals” may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. When these new requirements are fully implemented, they could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We are incurring additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. This requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict-free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our management’s attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in China, the U.S. and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might negatively affect our future operating results and financial condition. - 20 -System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our websites, products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and products. . In 2016 the Company became aware of a cyber-intrusion.  In response to this cyber-intrusion we have engaged an information technology security expert to assess the information accessed by the intruder and to assist in designing security measures to prevent a recurrence.  These efforts continue. At this time we have no reason to believe the cyber intruder obtained any confidential or propriety information. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, extortionate demands to decrypt files and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions and materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss, encryption or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, extortionate demands to decrypt files, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in China. In each of the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Asian and European subsidiaries represented approximately 90% of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:   •changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including income tax or value added tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;  •compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  •trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  •changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  •difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;  •currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;  •the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;  •legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  •longer customer payment terms; and  •changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions’ laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, including, but not limited to income tax and value added tax, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our operating results and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. - 21 -Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits.  Significant uncertainties related to changes in governmental policies and participation in international trading partnerships or economic unions currently exist, and, depending upon how such uncertainties are resolved, the changes could have a material adverse effect on us.Changes to existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, greater restrictions on international trade generally and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop, manufacture and sell products, and any negative reactions towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, negative sentiments towards the U.S. among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect our international sales or the hiring and retention of qualified employees, respectively.The United Kingdom referendum to exit the European Union has also created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the European Union, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business in the U.K. the European Union, and worldwide could be adversely affected during this period of uncertainty, and, depending upon developments following completion of the U.K. exit, may materially adversely affect our business and operations. Future events as a consequence of the U.K. exit, including stresses within the U.K. itself, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including global currency and debt markets, and result in a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by new or revised trade agreements between countries in which we have operations or do business, including the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and China, as well as by the possible impositions of tariffs or trade or other regulatory barriers by any nation where we have operations or do business. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Continuing weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in mainland China. In addition, in 2016 approximately 58% of our total sales were shipped to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”), China’s anti-corruption campaign and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and we have no third party attestation to the effectiveness of our internal controls related to fraud and corruption. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. - 22 -We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our operating results. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and operating results as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially if the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receive preferential tax treatment. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income. The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, thus reducing our net income. We intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent such undistributed earnings have previously been subject to U.S. tax. As of December 31, 2016, we had undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $507.6 million (including approximately $38.9 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Undistributed earnings of our China subsidiaries comprise $357.8 million of this total.  Additional U.S. federal and state income taxes of approximately $151.3 million would be required should the $507.6 million of such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. as dividends. In the future, if we plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S, we may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:   •strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  •general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;  •seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  •the timing of our and our competitors’ new product introductions;  •product obsolescence; - 23 - •the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  •the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers’ products;  •our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  •changes in manufacturing yields;  •adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  •the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investors and our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report, we are involved in several lawsuits. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. From time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:   •use a significant portion of our available cash;  •issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership;  •incur substantial debt;  •incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  •incur amortization expenses related to intangibles;  •incur large, immediate accounting write-offs; and •create goodwill and other intangible assets that may require impairment charges in the future. Such actions by us could harm our operating results and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 24% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2016. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 16.7% (approximately 8.1 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation (“LTC”), a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H. Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and a board member of LTC. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, a member of our Board of Directors and our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a board member of LTC and a board member of Nuvoton. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to LTC and a supervisor of the board of Nuvoton. Several of our directors and executive officers may own LSC common stock or hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, LSC accounted for approximately between 1% and 3% of our silicon wafer supply and our finished good supply. We may have - 24 -difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents since being formed. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the SEC to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of our Common Stock. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an “interested stockholder,” which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless:  (i)either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;  (ii)the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or  (iii)the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholder’s proportionate share ownership in the corporation. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. - 25 -  "
12,DIOD,DIODES INC,2016-03-11,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
. Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our net sales, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant net sales declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they affect the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability, technological innovation and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON - 10 -Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. One of our external suppliers is also a related party. The loss of this supplier could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for approximately 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, of our silicon wafer supply, and 3%, 2% and 3%, respectively, of our finished goods supply.  The loss of LSC as a supplier could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve product performance and cost. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost net sales. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss of future net sales and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products. Our wafer fabrication facilities are located in Shanghai, China, Kansas City, Missouri, and Manchester, U.K., while our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, Taipei, Taiwan, Chengdu, China, Jinan, China, and Neuhaus, Germany, perform assembly and test functions. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers’ shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. Our net sales growth and profit margins will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers may require our products to undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. In addition, we are focusing more on the automotive and industrial markets. These markets, automotive in particular, require higher quality standards.  Although we are working to ensure our organization and products meet the more rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurances we will succeed.  Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the product’s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a re-qualification process, which may result in delayed net sales and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, our customers may demand an audit of our records, product manufacturing, qualification, and packaging processes, business practices and other related items to verify that we have complied with our business obligations, standard processes and procedures, product specifications and certain governing laws and regulations related to our business practices, and in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of mutual business agreements.  If the audit shows any deficiency in any of these categories, our customers may require us to implement extensive protocols to remedy the deficiency, assess us significant - 11 -penalties, refuse shipments of our products, return existing inventory, cancel orders, or terminate our business relationship, each of which will adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition. All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from immediate delivery to twelve months or more in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our net sales, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers’ demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on low pin count semiconductor devices with one or more active or passive components. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor supplier with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing costs and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results and financial condition. - 12 -We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and related customer issues), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:   ·pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  ·cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  ·discontinue the use of infringing technology;  ·expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  ·pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  ·license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  ·relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. - 13 -We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. In some instances, a supplier may be our sole-source supplier.  Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs charged to us were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. In addition, we may be subject to quality claims from customers who purchased goods from companies before we acquired those companies.  Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are quality problems with the finished products we sell. From time to time, various suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may, in the future, choose not to supply products to us. If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, our operating results and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand our sales organization, manufacturing capacity, wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly and test operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:   ·difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  ·difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  ·the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  ·less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  ·even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we may continue to source wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;  ·difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  ·difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, operating results and financial condition may suffer. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc., (v) in 2012, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in 2012, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., (vii) in 2013, we acquired BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited and (viii) in 2015, we acquired Pericom Semiconductor Corporation. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired - 14 -acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:   ·unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  ·bringing the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  ·coordinating our new product and process development;  ·hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  ·increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  ·difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  ·difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entity’s business;  ·diversion of management’s attention from the management of our business; and  ·adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor, and intellectual property. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report for more information on our legal proceedings. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of - 15 -environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected financial liabilities. Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results and financial condition. Our products are typically sold at prices that are an insignificant portion of the overall value of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a television may be sold for several cents, whereas the television maker might sell the television for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the net sales and profits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer’s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our operating results and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. We may choose not to carry liability insurance, may not have sufficient insurance coverage, or may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possible warranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial/executive personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly and test facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profitable growth, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. - 16 -If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another supplier’s semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEM’s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant net sales from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful. We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We currently have a U.S. banking credit facility under which we may draw up to $500 million with the possibility of an additional $200 million. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. As of December 31, 2015, an increase of 1% in interest rates on our outstanding debt would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $5 million.We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt.  We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements on our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. As of December 31, 2015 $465 million was outstanding under our U.S. banking credit facility. In addition, we have short-term foreign credit facilities with borrowing capacities of approximately $84 million and with $1 million used for import and export guarantees. We have approximately $2 million of foreign long-term debt.  A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  ·making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;  ·resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  ·reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  ·subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;  ·limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  ·placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.  Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. Our U.S. banking credit facility contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments, issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. - 17 -Our ability to comply with the U.S. banking credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the facility. An event of default under the facility would permit the lenders under the facility to declare all amounts owed under such facility to be immediately due and payable in full. Upon acceleration of our indebtedness, we may be unable to repay the accelerated amount of principal and interest on the credit facilities that would then be due. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition-Debt instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai and Chengdu, China, in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise (“HNTE”) status. One of our Shanghai manufacturing facilities was approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2011-2013. For 2014 and future years, this facility no longer qualifies for HNTE status and, therefore, all of its income will be taxed at the statutory tax rate of 25%. Our other Shanghai manufacturing facility has been approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2015-2017. In addition, one of our wafer fabrication facilities and one research and development facility located in Shanghai have been approved for HNTE status for the tax years 2014-2016. HNTE qualification requires metrics based on China research and development expenditures as well as research and development headcount and overall college-degreed headcount.  Any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audit requirements. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for our approved Shanghai assembly and test facility and wafer fabrication facility would increase to 25% for any period in which an audit shows we were not compliant, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In connection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (“Go West”), where companies are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15% for doing business in western China. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The impact of our HNTE and Go West status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our tax expense by approximately $3 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $0.06. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for both the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $0.05.We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. - 18 -The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan’s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. The assets of our defined benefit pension plan (the “plan”) in the U.K. provide pensions to employees and former employees.  The plan’s assets consist primarily of high-quality, corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange and are determined, from time to time, based on their fair market value.  The plan’s obligation to pay pensions is estimated by using actuarial assumptions. To the extent that the plan’s assets are not sufficient to meet the estimated amount of the plan’s obligations, further funding of the plan will be required by the plan’s sponsoring employers, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, over an agreed upon deficit recovery period.As of December 31, 2015, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $145 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $116 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $29 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the U.K. equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding, (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost, and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.            During the second quarter of 2012, we adopted a payment plan with the trustees of the defined benefit plan, under which we would pay approximately British Pound (“GBP”) 2 million (approximately $3 million based on a USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.6:1) every year from 2012 through 2019. In the first quarter of 2015, based on the pension deficit, we adopted (as required every three years) an amended payment plan in which we will pay approximately GBP 2 million (approximately $3 million based on a USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.6:1) annually through 2030. This revised payment plan resulted in an increase of total required contributions from GBP 8 million to GBP 33 million (approximately $46 million). If we fail to reach an agreement with the trustees, as we are required to do every three years, the Pension Regulator in the U.K. could impose contributions on Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited, or in limited circumstances could require financial support to be provided to the plan from entities connected or associated with Diodes Zetex Limited or Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited. Furthermore, Diodes Zetex Limited and Diodes Zetex Semiconductors Limited remain ultimately liable to fully fund the plan regardless of any failure to agree upon future contributions in respect of a particular actuarial valuation, i.e., if either the plan or those companies were wound up, a debt equal to each company’s share of the entire outstanding deficit at that time (calculated on a statutory conservative basis) would be owed by the relevant company. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.  Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and operating results. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers’ codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our - 19 -compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of “conflict minerals” may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. When these new requirements are fully implemented, they could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We are incurring additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. This requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict-free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our management’s attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Our management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded the operations of Pericom. If we are not able to integrate Pericom operations into our internal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX 404”) requires us to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a “material weakness” or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.- 20 - Complying with SOX 404 is time consuming and costly. The integration of Pericom operations into our internal control over financial reporting will require additional time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs.  Failure to comply with SOX 404, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate Pericom operations into our internal control over financial reporting, or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, and the trading price of our Common Stock may decline. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our access to the capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our Common Stock may decline.Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in China, the U.S. and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might negatively affect our future operating results and financial condition. System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our websites, products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, extortionate demands to decrypt files and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions and materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss, encryption or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, extortionate demands to decrypt files, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could materially adversely affect our operating results, stock price and reputation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located in China. In each of the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Asian and European subsidiaries represented approximately 90% of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:   ·changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including income tax or value added tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;  ·compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  ·trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  ·changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  ·difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts; - 21 - ·currency exchange rate fluctuations;  ·restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;  ·the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;  ·legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  ·longer customer payment terms; and  ·changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions’ laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, including, but not limited to income tax and value added tax, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our operating results and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Continuing weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in mainland China. In addition, in 2015 approximately 60% of our total sales were shipped to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. - 22 -We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our operating results. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and operating results as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially if the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries, and any increase in labor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annual increase in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receive preferential tax treatment. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income. The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. may be subject to U.S. income taxes, thus reducing our net income. We intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent such undistributed earnings have previously been subject to U.S. tax. As of December 31, 2015, we had undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $536 million (including approximately $42 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Undistributed earnings of our China subsidiaries comprise $383 million of this total.  Additional U.S. federal and state income taxes of approximately $146 million would be required should the $536 million of such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. as dividends. In the future, if we plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S, we may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:   ·strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  ·general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products; - 23 - ·seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  ·the timing of our and our competitors’ new product introductions;  ·product obsolescence;  ·the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  ·the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers’ products;  ·our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  ·changes in manufacturing yields;  ·adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  ·the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investors and our operating results for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report, we are involved in several lawsuits. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. From time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:   ·use a significant portion of our available cash;  ·issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership;  ·incur substantial debt;  ·incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  ·incur amortization expenses related to intangibles;  ·incur large, immediate accounting write-offs; and ·create goodwill and other intangible assets that may require impairment charges in the future. Such actions by us could harm our operating results and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 24% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2015. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 17% (approximately 8.1 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation (“LTC”), a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H. Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and a board member of LTC. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, a member of our Board of Directors and our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a board member of LTC and a board member of Nuvoton. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to LTC and a supervisor of the board of Nuvoton. Several of our directors and executive officers may own LSC common stock or hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with - 24 -decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, LSC accounted for approximately 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, of our silicon wafer supply, and 3%, 2% and 3%, respectively, of our finished goods supply.   We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents since being formed. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the SEC to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of our Common Stock. Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an “interested stockholder,” which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless:  (i)either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;  (ii)the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or  (iii)the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholder’s proportionate share ownership in the corporation. - 25 -Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.   "
7,DIOD,DIODES INC,2014-02-27,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the followingrisks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currentlyknown to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financialmarkets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spendingand demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of ourcustomers to meet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues and lower profit marginsmay have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficulteconomic environments, we could be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing   -11 - Table of Contentsfacilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are expensedimmediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates andconsequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and/or changes in end-market demand could adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition.  The semiconductor industry ishighly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time,the semiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in thetechnology sector. The market for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result,cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition than compared to some ofour broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with theintroduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experiencechanges in demand that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Thesemiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competitionfrom existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are largerand have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop newproducts, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types andtechnologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G.,International Rectifier Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitivepressures may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  One of our largestexternal suppliers is also a related party. The loss of this supplier could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for approximately 1%, of our net sales.LSC is also one of our largest suppliers, providing us with discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 2%, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2013, 2012 and 2011.   -12 - Table of ContentsThe loss of LSC as a supplier, could materially harm ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  Delays in initiation of production atfacilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and wemay not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and productperformance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, constructiondelays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, productiondelays and a loss of future revenues and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increaseproportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products.  Our waferfabrication facilities are located in Shanghai, China, Kansas City, Missouri, and Manchester, United Kingdom (U.K.), while our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, Taipei, Taiwan and Neuhaus, Germany, perform packaging, assembly andtest functions and our manufacturing facilities in Chengdu, China are for surface-mounted component production, assembly and test functions. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturingefficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.  We are and will continue to be undercontinuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuingpressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements. We must also striveto minimize our customers shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. We experienced a decrease in average selling prices (ASP) for our products of 2% in 2011,a decrease of 10% in 2012 and an increase of 5% in 2013. At times, we may be required to sell our products at ASP below our manufacturing costs or purchase prices in order to remain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products willsuffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assuranceof product sales, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensivequalification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Evenafter successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in the products manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, whichmay result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate ourproducts. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying   -13 - Table of Contentsour products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales ofsuch product to the customer, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations andfinancial condition.  All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation ormodification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking neworders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter lead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customerrequires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changes in demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, andmay be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number ofpurchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, includingnatural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have amaterial adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or other similar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or othermanufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinary events. Such disruptions may cause direct injury ordamage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significanttime to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by theshortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease indemand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on discrete, logic and analogsemiconductor products. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could resultin a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes thedevelopment of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability todesign, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-  -14 - Table of Contentseffective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products tomarket or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner.  Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have agreater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor manufacturer with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering andresearch and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on ourcompetitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplishthese goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition.  We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our majorbusiness functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinateour administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays inour service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computerviruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations andfinancial condition.  As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuouslyneed to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial,operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade otherinformation technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist incompliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issuestherewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform.To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subjectto electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on ERP systems different from ours and that we could face difficulties in integratingoperational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, resultsof operations and financial condition.   -15 - Table of ContentsWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-partyintellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.  The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection andpursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and havedemanded, and may in the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractualindemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail inlitigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:     pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;     cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;     discontinue the use of infringing technology;     expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;     pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringingtechnology;      license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonableterms, or at all; or      relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid orotherwise unenforceable.  We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries ofraw materials, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in atimely manner.  Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate suppliesof raw materials, parts and equipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costsof raw materials, parts or equipment were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise tocompatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied rawmaterial and be beyond our detection or control. Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results ofoperations and financial condition.  In addition, we sell finished products from othermanufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. From time to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacityconstraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturercould discontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.   -16 - Table of ContentsIf we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate ourbusiness, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, results of operations and financial condition. We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuingto expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expand our wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development and assembly/test operations incompany-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:      difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and managementof manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;      difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our United States(U.S.) headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;      the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;     less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;     even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafers from our captive manufacturingfacilities, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;      difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and     difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in anindustry-wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfullyvertically integrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines orcustomers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which couldadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Asignificant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementary product lines, customers or other capabilities. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our ownwafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market, (iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc.,(v) in 2012, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in 2012, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., and (vii) in 2013, we acquired BCD Semiconductor ManufacturingLimited. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful inidentifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operations or product lines with ouroperations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of thebenefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:     unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;     bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  -17 - Table of Contents   coordinating our new product and process development;     hiring additional management and other critical personnel;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;     difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;     difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;     diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and     adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defendand the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.  All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of ourmanagement and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routinematters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor, and intellectual property. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, theresolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As mentioned above, from time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securitieslitigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from theinitiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be,volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. See Part I,Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report for more information on our legal proceedings.  We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules andregulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our products throughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the FederalClean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipmentor to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or  -18 - Table of Contentssewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified astoxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning upcontamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be jointand several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations oradversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of newlaws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities. Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may beasserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results of operations and financial condition. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment orother goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a television may be sold for several cents, whereas the television maker might sell the television for several hundred dollars. Although we maintainrigorous quality control systems, we shipped approximately 41 billion, 32 billion and 29 billion individual semiconductor devices in years ending December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to customers around the world, and in theordinary course of our business, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise tofailures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the productsinvolved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we maychoose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issuein our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possiblewarranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition.  We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing,finance and management personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical,sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance andmanagerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competitionfor qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly, test and packaging facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recentlyestablished and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are   -19 - Table of Contentsunable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially andadversely affected.  We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place astrain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requires effectiveplanning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. Inaddition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profit growthor achieve future growth, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products intowhich our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future beadversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, somecustomers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may becomeobsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If OEMs do notdesign our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specificallyfor our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to theseOEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve futuredesign wins with that OEMs product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from thatcustomer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are notcommercially successful.  We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on ourcost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have credit facilities with financial institutions in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as other debtinstruments, with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiated margin. Our largest credit facility is our five-year $300 million revolving senior credit facility, which had $179 million outstanding as of December 31, 2013.A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. As of December 31, 2013, an increase of 1% in interest rates on our credit facilities would increase our annual interest rateexpense by less than $1 million.   -20 - Table of ContentsWe may have a significant amount of debt with various financialinstitutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such debt. We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements in our borrowings,including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. During 2013, we obtained a five-year $300 million revolving senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., which had $179 million outstanding as of December 31,2013. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate outstanding debt of $6 million on our lines of credit, which an additional $7 million was used for import and export guarantees under our credit facilities with various financialinstitutions worldwide. As of December 31, 2013 an aggregate amount of $99 million was available for future borrowings under our lines of credit and $121 million under our revolving senior credit facility. We are permitted under the terms ofour debt agreements under various credit facilities to incur substantial additional debt.  Asignificant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:      making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;     resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in ourdebt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;     reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other generalcorporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;      subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interestrates;      limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, theindustry in which we operate and the general economy; and      placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.  Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. During 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent forthe lenders under the credit agreement, which provides for a five-year $300 million revolving senior credit facility, which includes $10 million swing line sublimit, a $10 million letter of credit sublimit, and $20 million alternative currencysublimit. In addition, we may from time to time request increases in the aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement of up to $200 million, subject to the lenders electing to increase their commitments or by means of the addition of new lenders. This Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business andfinancial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. Therestrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments,issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct   -21 - Table of Contentsrelated party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to others for thesame purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, includingprevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event ofdefault under the Credit Agreement would permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owed under such Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interestpayments for the credit facilities and repay the principal amount of the credit facilities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsDebt instruments in Part II,Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information.  Our business benefits from certainChinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including ourmanufacturing facilities located in Shanghai, China, in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income taxrate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise HNTE status. One of our Shanghai manufacturing facilities has been approved for its HNTE status for the tax years2011-2013. For 2014 and future years, this facility no longer qualifies for the HNTE status and therefore all of its future and deferred income will be taxed at the statutory tax rate of 25%. Our other Shanghai manufacturing facility has beenapproved for its HNTE status for the tax years 2012-2014. In addition, one of our wafer fabrication facilities located in Shanghai has been approved for its HNTE status for the tax years 2011-2013. We expect this facility to be approved for its HNTEstatus for tax year 2014 . Any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audits to ensure all requirements are met. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for our approved Shanghai manufacturingfacility and wafer fabrication facility would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. During 2012, the China government began an audit of our largest Chinese subsidiary for our 2009-2011HNTE status as part of an overall evaluation of the reduced tax rates provided to many high tech companies. In April 2013, we were notified by the China government that they had completed their tax audit and had concluded that we owed additional taxrelated to tax year 2011 in the amount of $5 million, which was paid during 2013.  Inconnection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (Go West), where companies are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15% for doing business in westernChina. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The impact of our Go West and HNTE status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our tax expenseby approximately $2 million, $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013was approximately $0.05. The benefit of the tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $0.14 and $0.13, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and dilutedearnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $0.15.   -22 - Table of ContentsWe operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries,and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies and/or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries, and are therefore subject to complextransfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms lengthtransaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significanttax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially fromour provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequenceswhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of theCompany and its subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition,any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in the Company becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The value of our benefit planassets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit, which is closedto new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarialassumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on planassets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded inthe consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.  Changes inactuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plans asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financialcondition.  The assets of our defined benefit plan (the plan) consistprimarily of high quality, corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange and are determined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilize certain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair valuedetermination.  As of December 31, 2013, the benefit obligation of the plan wasapproximately $149 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $117 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $33 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, isa significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in several keyactuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and   -23 - Table of Contentsmortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the eventthat actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase infuture plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In 2012, we adopted a payment plan with the trustees of the defined benefit plan, in which we will payapproximately £2 million GBP (approximately $3 million based on a USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.6:1) every year from 2012 through 2019. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certainrestrictions that may substantially increase the cost of our business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code ofConduct (EICC) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements underthe laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement suchnew provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and results of operations. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we maylose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers codes of conduct, there canbe no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.  Compliancewith government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of conflict minerals may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affectthe pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related todetermining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free ofconflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability ofproducts we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.The disclosure rules will take effect for us in May 2014.  There are risks associated with previous andfuture acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher thananticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls into conformance with our  -24 - Table of Contentsoperations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope,geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our managements attention from the management ofour business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We mayultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and otherintangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future.  If we fail tomaintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and thetrading price of our Common Stock.  Effective internal controls are necessary for usto produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in theconclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. Thereare inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we failto maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports orprevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the United States orinternationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in theUnited States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt oursupply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which weship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in China, Missouri and the U.K., or to our regionalsales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results of operations and financialcondition.  System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other relatedcybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls andmisappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious softwareprograms that attack our websites, products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security   -25 - Table of Contentsproblems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result ininterruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to ourbusiness and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers,including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of thisinformation, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could besignificant.  Delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these systemsecurity risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total netsales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas in China. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, our Asian and European subsidiaries represented 91%, 90% and 88%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent indoing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:      changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries inwhich we manufacture or sell our products;      compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;     trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;     changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;     difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;     currency exchange rate fluctuations;     restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;     the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;     legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;     longer customer payment terms; and     changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations. We have significant operations and assets in China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as aresult, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong andTaiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations,  -26 - Table of Contentsland use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that our operationsare in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additionalexpenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.  Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import dutiesor currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of ourproducts or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadicand implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions.The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products,which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.  We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, there can be noassurance that such growth will continue. Any weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations andprospects.  Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and prospects.  We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacityin China. In addition, in 2013 36% of our total sales were billed to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors,the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in Chinaor decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UnitedKingdoms Bribery Act 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.  The UnitedStates Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 (the UK Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediariesfrom making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmentalcorruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and related anti-bribery laws. We haveestablished procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If weare found to be liable for FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions,which could have a material adverse effect on our business.   -27 - Table of ContentsWe are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principallythe Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relativeto the other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we willexperience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits andresults of operations as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have anadverse impact upon our financial results, especially as the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experiencecurrency losses as these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.  China is experiencing rapidsocial, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  Historically, labor in China has been readilyavailable at a lower cost compared to other countries, and any increase in labor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annual increase in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because China isexperiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher thanhistorical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulationson employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, ouroperations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be sharedby us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. Theseevents could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense andreducing our net income.  As an incentive for establishing our manufacturingsubsidiaries in China, we received preferential tax treatment. We also receive preferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in thefuture, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income.  Thedistribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to United States income taxes, thus reducing our net income. With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007 and 2011, we intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. This was the case during the first quarter of 2009, in which werepatriated approximately $29 million of accumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resulting in additional non-cash U.S. federal and state income tax expense of approximately $5 million.   -28 - Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2013, accumulated and undistributedearnings of our subsidiaries in China were approximately $354 million, which we consider as a permanent investment. As of December 31, 2013, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately$430 million (including approximately $45 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Additional U.S. federal and state income taxes of approximately $101 million would be required should such earnings be repatriated tothe U.S.  We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries tothe U.S. We may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings aredistributed.  RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results fromquarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:      strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;     general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;     seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;     the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;     product obsolescence;      the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;     the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers products;     our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;     changes in manufacturing yields;     adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and     the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarilymeaningful to investors and our results of operations for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or internationalmacroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results ofoperations or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report, we are involved in several lawsuits. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing ofadditional litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.  We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement ourvertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. From time to time, we may be in various stages of   -29 - Table of Contentsdiscussions and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:     use a significant portion of our available cash;     issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;     incur substantial debt;      incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;     incur amortization expenses related to intangibles;     incur large, immediate accounting write-offs; and     create goodwill and other intangible assets that may require impairment charges in the future. Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our CommonStock.  Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion ofour Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 28% of ouroutstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2013. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiringstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which couldadversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.  LSC, our largest stockholder, ownsapproximately 18% (approximately 8 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. RaymondSoong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation, a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H. Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the ViceChairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and Lite-On Technology Corporation. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, is a member of the Board of Directors ofLite-On Technology Corporation. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directors and executive officers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSCcommon stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest whendirectors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreementswe may enter into with LSC. In each of 2013, 2012 and 2011, LSC accounted for approximately 1% of our net sales. Also, in 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 2%, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net sales were from products manufactured by LSC, makingLSC one of our largest external suppliers of discrete semiconductor products.  We may havedifficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty inassessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have hadseveral transfer agents since being formed. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger,   -30 - Table of Contentsare incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records areincomplete.  Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our businessactivities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges inaccordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock inlarge quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued CommonStock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of ourCommon Stock.  Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate ofIncorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt.  Someprovisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over themarket price for the shares held by stockholders.  Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter atake-over attempt.  Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibitstransactions between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding votingshares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder,unless:    (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder isapproved by the corporations board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;    (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directorswho are also officers or by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or    (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66.66% of theoutstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions ofassets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested stockholders proportionate shareownership in the corporation.  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect ofmaking it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares ofpreferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.   -31 - Table of ContentsThe existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of amerger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.   "
5,DIOD,DIODES INC,2013-02-27,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
   Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Ourbusiness, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.  RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS  The success of our business depends onthe strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand foritems that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers tomeet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues and lower profit margins may have anegative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The semiconductorindustry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could befaced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacityare expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. When our utilization rates decline to abnormally low production levels, we generally experience lower gross margins. The market conditions in the future may adversely affect ourutilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and/or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.  The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodicallyexperiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industryexperiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market forsemiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our results of operations and financial condition.   -9-Table of ContentsIn addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductormarket and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to the broader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our results of operations and financial conditionthan compared to some of our broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and thecosts associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to becyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existingcompetitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and havegreater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to develop new products,market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologiesthan we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., InternationalRectifier Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures mayharm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We receive a significant portion of our net salesfrom two customers, one of which is our largest external supplier and both of which are related parties. The loss of these customers or suppliers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for approximately 1%, of our net sales. LSC is also ourlargest supplier, providing us with discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 3%, 5% and 7%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, we sold products to companies owned by Keylink, totaling 3%, 2% and 3%,respectively, of our net sales. Also for 2012, 2011 and 2010, 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, of our net sales were from semiconductor products purchased from companies owned by Keylink. The loss of LSC as a supplier, or Keylink as a customer or supplier, could materially harm our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.  Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new productiontechniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be ableto maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance.Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or otherproblems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss offuture revenues and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event ofa decline in demand for our products.  Our wafer fabrication facilities are located near Kansas City,Missouri, and Manchester, United Kingdom (U.K.), while our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China and Neuhaus, Germany, perform packaging, assembly and test functions and our manufacturing facilities in Chengdu, China are forsurface-mounted component production, assembly and test functions. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.   -10-Table of ContentsWe are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers andcompetitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.  Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive andretain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals forrationalization of supply and production. We experienced an increase in average selling prices (ASP) for our products of 5% in 2010, a decrease of 2% in 2011 and a decrease of 10% in 2012. At times, we may be required to sell ourproducts at ASP below our manufacturing costs or purchase prices in order to remain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product pricescompetitive.  Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without anyassurance of product sales, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continuefor six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product,changes in the products manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it cantake an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales,marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales ofsuch product to the customer, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation orreduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-termsupply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorterlead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changesin demand in the end-markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources tofulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may buildup excess inventory and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.  Production at ourmanufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customersdemands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A disruption inproduction at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or othersimilar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinaryevents. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, maycost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extendedperiod of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on ourresults of operations and financial condition.   -11-Table of ContentsNew technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitorsand a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on discrete, logic and analog semiconductor products.Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in ournet sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes the development of newtypes of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop,manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify newproduct opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive,and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor manufacturer with a wider range of product types and technologies.Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our productmarkets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue toreduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows,results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations are dependent upon our informationtechnology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activitiesacross all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpectedincreases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged orinterrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverseeffect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.  As our operations grow in both sizeand scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commitsubstantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currentlyseeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our corebusiness to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology(and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. To manage ourinternational operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electricalor telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on ERP systems different from ours and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational andaccounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations andfinancial condition.   -12-Table of ContentsWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual propertyrights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in thefuture demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of ourcustomers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complextechnical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:      pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;     cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;     discontinue the use of infringing technology;      expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;     pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;     license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or atall; or      relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwiseunenforceable.  We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts andequipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, parts andequipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials, parts orequipment were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performanceissues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond ourdetection or control. Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results of operations and financialcondition.  In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also beadversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. From time to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have nolong-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at anytime. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.  If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete,results of operations and financial condition.  We are continuing to vertically integrate our business.Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expand our wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development,package development and assembly/test operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:     difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturingfacilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;      difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our United States(U.S.) headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;      the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;     less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;     even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may resultin us having higher costs than our competitors;   -13-Table of Contents   difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and     difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixedcosts associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our abilityto compete, profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.  Part of our growth strategyinvolves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable tosuccessfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementary product lines, customers orother capabilities. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market,(iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc., (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc., (v) in 2011, we acquired over 50% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation, (vi) also in2011, we acquired Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc., and (vii) on December 26, 2012, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited and expect the acquisition to close late in the firstquarter or early in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions with potential acquisition targets as we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making furtheracquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies ortheir operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Inaddition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associatedwith:      unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;     bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;     coordinating our new product and process development;     hiring additional management and other critical personnel;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;     difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;     difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;     diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and     adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to a variety ofU.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our productsthroughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutesand regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantlyincrease, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation ofoperations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from ourmanufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may beclassified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, aswell as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liabilityinvolved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limitour ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incuradditional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities.   -14-Table of ContentsOur products may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims andproduct liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results of operations and financial condition. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods inwhich they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several cents, whereas the computer maker might sell the personal computer for several hundred dollars. Although we maintainrigorous quality control systems, we shipped approximately 32 billion, 29 billion and 28 billion individual semiconductor devices in years ending December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to customers around the world, and in theordinary course of our business, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise tofailures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the productsinvolved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we maychoose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issuein our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possiblewarranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition.  We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managementpersonnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise arescarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highlyqualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in China, where our assembly, test and packagingfacilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establish factories and plants in China, and the competition forqualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could bematerially and adversely affected.  We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strainon our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requires effective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strainon our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectivelyplan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profit growth or achieve future growth, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.  Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of ourproducts could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The lifecycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory mayalso become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or theestimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out ofbusiness due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   -15-Table of ContentsIf OEMs do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we designspecifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell ourproducts to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us toachieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenuesfrom that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its ownproducts are not commercially successful.  We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on ourcost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We have credit facilities with financial institutions in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as other debt instruments, with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiated margin. Arise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. As of December 31, 2012, an increase of 1% in interest rates on our credit facilities would increase our annual interest rate expenseby less than $1 million. In addition, on January 8, 2013, we entered into a five year $300 million revolving senior credit facility, which will further increase our sensitivity to rising interest rates depending on how much we draw down in thefuture.  We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness couldadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such debt.  We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements in our borrowings, including our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. On February 1,2012, we obtained a three-year term loan in the amount of $40 million with Bank of America, N.A. As of December 31, 2012, we had an aggregate outstanding debt of $8 million on our lines of credit, which an additional $1 million was used forimport and export guarantees under our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. In addition, as of December 31, 2012 an aggregate amount of $102 million was available for future borrowings under our credit facilities inthe U.S., Asia and Europe, and we are permitted under the terms of our debt agreements under various credit facilities to incur substantial additional debt. On January 8, 2013, we entered into a five year $300 million revolving senior creditfacility, under which we could significantly increase the amount of our outstanding debt depending on how much we draw down in the future.  A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:      making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;     resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, whichevent of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility, could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assetssecuring that debt;      reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, andlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;      subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowingsunder senior secured credit facility;      limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which weoperate and the general economy; and      placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financialcondition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.   Restrictions in our credit facilitiesmay limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future.  On January 8, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders under the credit agreement, which provides for a five year $300 millionrevolving senior credit facility, which includes $10 million swing line sublimit, a $10 million letter of credit sublimit, and $20 million alternative currency sublimit. In addition, we may from time to time request increases in the aggregatecommitment under the Credit Agreement of up to $200 million, subject to the lenders electing to increase their commitments or by means of the addition of new lenders.   -16-Table of ContentsThis Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions onour business and financial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as theyarise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restrictedpayments, issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carrymargin stock or to extend credit to others for the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailingeconomic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event of defaultunder the Credit Agreement would permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owed under such Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments forthe credit facilities and repay the principal amount of the credit facilities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Debt instruments in Part II, Item 7 of thisAnnual Report for additional information.  Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expirationof, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The Chinese government has provided various incentives to technology companies, including our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai, China, in order to encourage development of the high-techindustry. These incentives include reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, we are entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as our manufacturing facilities continue to maintain their High and New TechnologyEnterprise HNTE status. One of our Shanghai facilities has been approved for its HNTE status for the tax years 2011-2013, while our other Shanghai facility has been approved for its HNTE status for the tax years 2012-2014. In addition,any prior years that have already been approved are subject to audits to ensure all requirements are met. If we were to no longer meet the HNTE requirements, our statutory tax rate for these facilities would increase to 25%, which would adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.  During 2012, the China government began an audit ofour largest Chinese subsidiary for our 2009-2011 HNTE status. To date, the government has not issued the results of their audit.  In connection with our joint venture in Chengdu, China, we have qualified for tax incentives offered in the Go West Initiative (Go West), where companies are entitled to a preferential incometax rate of 15% for doing business in western China. If we were to no longer meet the Go West requirements, our statutory tax rate for this joint venture would increase to 25%, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  The impact of our Go West and HNTE status, collectively called tax holidays, decreased our taxexpense by approximately $6 million, $7 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012was approximately $0.14 and $0.13, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $0.15. The benefit of the tax holidays on basic and dilutedearnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $0.19 and $0.18, respectively.  The valueof our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used. Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit, which isclosed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarialassumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on planassets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded inthe consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.   -17-Table of ContentsChanges in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase thevolatility of the plans asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The assets of our defined benefit plan (the plan) consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds and stockstraded on the London Stock Exchange and are determined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilize certain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair value determination. As of December 31, 2012, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $125 million and the total assets insuch plan were approximately $107 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately $18 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the netperiodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan.  Any fluctuations in theUnited Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in several key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of planfunding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the fundingstatus of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have anegative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In 2012, we adopted a payment plan withthe trustees of the defined benefit plan, in which we will pay approximately £2 million GBP (approximately $3 million based on a USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.6:1) every year from 2012 through 2019. In 2010, we established a joint venture to build a semiconductor facility in Chengdu, China. We are required to contribute at least$48 million to the joint venture during the first three years with additional contributions thereafter, as well as a substantial amount of time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. Any failure to meet any such requirements,delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties or require us to contribute additional expenses or resources and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financialconditions.  Effective as of September 10, 2010, we entered into an Investment CooperationAgreement and a Supplementary Agreement to the Investment Cooperation Agreement (collectively, the CDHT Agreements) with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (CDHT) to build a facilityin Chengdu, China, with a Chinese local partner, for surface-mounted component production, assembly and test functions. The CDHT Agreements required us to contribute substantial capital to the joint venture, including at least $48 million ininstallments by December 14, 2012, as well as time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. Due to pending approval from the Chinese government for completion of the restructuring of our China corporate entities, we received anextension to contribute the required amount until December 31, 2013. We must obtain various licenses, permissions, certifications and approvals, from time to time, related to the joint ventures business operations. Any failure to meet anysuch requirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties, or require us to cease of operations, or contribute additional expenses and/or resources and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our operatingefficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions. As of December 31, 2012, we have invested approximately $25 million of which $20 million were for capital expenditures. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictionsthat may substantially increase the cost of our business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct(EICC) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the lawsof the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such newprovisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and results of operations. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may losefurther business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers codes of conduct, there can be noassurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.   -18-Table of ContentsCompliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the useof conflict minerals may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding theuse of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of mineralsused in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used inour products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges withour customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from suppliers. This may reduce the number ofsuppliers that may be able to provide conflict free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices. The disclosure rules will take effect for us in May 2014. There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcomingthese risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.  The risks commonlyencountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringingstandards, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope,geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversion of our managements attention from the management ofour business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integration slower and more challenging. We mayultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort toprevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internalcontrols are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls,including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or ifmanagement or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition andresults of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.  Terrorist attacks, orthreats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in theUnited States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt oursupply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which weship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in China, Taiwan and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in Missouri and the U.K., or to our regional salesoffices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results of operations and financialcondition.   -19-Table of ContentsSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other relatedcybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate orcompromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attackour websites, products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our websites and products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and securityvulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales,manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.  We manage and store various proprietary informationand sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive orconfidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or theindividuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences ofimplementing further data protection measures could be significant.  Delayed sales, significant costs or lostcustomers resulting from these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cybersecurity issues could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations.  We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas in China. In2012, 2011 and 2010, net sales to customers outside the U.S. represented 84%, 83% and 78%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to ourbusiness:      changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufactureor sell our products;      compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;     trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;     changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;     difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;     currency exchange rate fluctuations;      restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;     the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;     legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;     longer customer payment terms; and      changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations.  We have significant operations and assets in China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions,which may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  We have a significantportion of our assets in mainland China, United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating totaxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that ouroperations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would requireadditional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.  Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitionson our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions.   -20-Table of ContentsThere can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic andimplementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. Thepossibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.  We believe that an increase in demandin China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, there can be no assurance that such growth will continue. Any weaknessin the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in China. In addition, in 2012 35% of our total sales were billed to customersin China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulategrowth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.  We could be adversely affected byviolations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.  The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 (the UK Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictionsgenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts ofthe world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the UK Bribery Actand related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal actscommitted by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminalor civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are subject to foreign currencyrisk as a result of our international operations.  We face exposure to adverse movements in foreigncurrency exchange rates, principally the Chinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currenciesand a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollarweakens against a foreign currency, we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasinglyinfluential to our overall sales, profits and results of operations as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activityin foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially as the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currencyexposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs thatcould make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries, and any increase inlabor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annual increase in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be noassurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multiple times in any givenyear. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on   -21-Table of Contentsemployee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if Chinaworkers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increasein their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturingpartners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our netincome.  As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receivedpreferential tax treatment. We also receive preferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increasein our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income.  The distribution of any earnings of our foreignsubsidiaries to the United States may be subject to United States income taxes, thus reducing our net income.  With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007 and 2011, we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvest overseas allearnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. This was the case during the first quarter of 2009, in which we repatriated approximately $29 million of accumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resultingin additional non-cash U.S. federal and state income tax expense of approximately $5 million.  As ofDecember 31, 2012, accumulated and undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in China were approximately $192 million, which we consider as a permanent investment. As of December 31, 2012, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $311 million(including approximately $38 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Additional U.S. federal and state income taxes of approximately $58 million would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. We may be requiredto pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter toquarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:      strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;     general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;     seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;     the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;     product obsolescence;      the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;     the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers products;     our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;     changes in manufacturing yields;      adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and     the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investorsand our results of operations for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price.   -22-Table of ContentsWe may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with suchacquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  As part of our growthstrategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. On December 26, 2012, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with BCD SemiconductorManufacturing Limited and expect the acquisition to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, from time to time, we may be in various stages of discussions and we may acquire businesses, products ortechnologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:      use a significant portion of our available cash;      issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;     incur substantial debt;      incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;     incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and     incur large, immediate accounting write-offs. Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead toconflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters.  Ourdirectors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 27% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012.These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. Thiscontrol may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.  LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 18% (approximately 8 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interestbecause of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation, a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H.Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and Lite-On Technology Corporation. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, our President and Chief Executive Officer and amember of our Board of Directors, is a member of the Board of Directors of Lite-On Technology Corporation. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directorsand executive officers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create,or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisionsinvolving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In each of 2012, 2011 and 2010, LSC accounted for less than 1% of our net sales. Also, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately 3%, 5% and 7%,respectively, of our net sales were from products manufactured by LSC, making LSC our largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products.  We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party. We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing anddefending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete.  We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transfer agents over the past 50 years. In addition, our early corporate records,including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effectof diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges in accordance with theguidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to consummate our business activities.   -23-Table of ContentsSuch means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders,including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition,utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of our Common Stock.  Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt. Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effectand may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.  Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt.  Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together withany affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and aDelaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless:    (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by thecorporations board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;    (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officersor by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or    (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stockthat is not owned by the interested stockholder.  For this purpose, business combinationsinclude mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that wouldincrease the interested stockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation.  Certificate of Incorporation and BylawProvisions may deter a take-over attempt.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylawsmay have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directorsto render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.   "
11,DIOD,DIODES INC,2012-02-28,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
   Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Ourbusiness, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.  RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS  The success of our business depends onthe strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand foritems that incorporate our products in the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline in end-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers tomeet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected by such actions. During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues and lower profit margins may have anegative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The semiconductorindustry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments, we could befaced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacityare expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. This was the case at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009 when our utilization rates declined to abnormally low production levels, which resulted in lower gross margins. The marketconditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and/or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.  The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodicallyexperiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industryexperiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at end-equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. The market forsemiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns, which may harm our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to the broadersemiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. In addition, we may experiencesignificant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demandin the consumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-user markets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highlycompetitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in various markets withcompanies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. Asa result, they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad line semiconductor manufacturers whooften have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild  -10-Table of ContentsSemiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., International Rectifier Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporationand Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We receive a portion of our net sales from three customers, which all are related parties. In addition, two of these customers arelarge external suppliers. The loss of these customers or suppliers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In 2011, 2010 and 2009, LSC, our largest stockholder, accounted for less than 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, of our net sales. LSC is also our largest supplier, providing us with discrete semiconductorproducts for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 5%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we subcontracted a portion of our manufacturing to Eris Technology Corporation (Eris), a publicly traded company listed as an Emerging Stock on the Taiwan OTC Exchange(TWO) that provides design, manufacturing and after-market services for diode products. We purchase finished goods, some sourced from our wafers and some not sourced from our wafers. Eris provides us with discrete semiconductor products forsubsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 2%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  In addition, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, we sold products to companies owned by Keylink, totaling 2%, 3% and 3%, respectively. Also for 2011, 2010 and 2009, 1%, 2% and 1%, respectively, of our net sales werefrom semiconductor products purchased from companies owned by Keylink.  The loss of LSC, Keylink or Eris aseither a customer or a supplier, or any significant reductions in either the amount of products LSC, Keklink and/or Eris supplies to us, or the volume of orders LSC, Keylink or Eris places with us, could materially harm our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.  Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new productiontechniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may not be ableto maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance.Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or otherproblems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities, building new facilities, bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss offuture revenues and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event ofa decline in demand for our products.  Our wafer fabrication facilities are located near Kansas City,Missouri, and near Manchester, United Kingdom (U.K.), while our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China and Neuhaus, Germany, perform packaging, assembly and test functions and our two joint venture facilities in Chengdu, China forsurface mount component production, assembly and test functions. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products,which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.  Prices for our products tend to decreaseover their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs throughproduct and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customers shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. We experienced a decrease in averageselling prices (ASP) for our products of 10% in 2009, an increase of 5% in 2010 and a decrease of 2% in 2011. At times, we may be required to sell our products at ASP below our manufacturing costs or purchase prices in order to remaincompetitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive.   -11-Table of ContentsOur customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualificationprocess without any assurance of product sales, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continuefor six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product,changes in the products manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it cantake an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales,marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales ofsuch product to the customer, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation orreduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-termsupply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorterlead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods of excess inventory due to changesin demand in the end markets our industry serves. As a result, many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources tofulfilling these purchase orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of purchase orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may buildup excess inventory and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.  Production at ourmanufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customersdemands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A disruption inproduction at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, disease or othersimilar natural disasters, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, labor shortages, power outages or shortages, telecommunications failures, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, terrorism or other extraordinaryevents. Such disruptions may cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property and related internal controls with significant indirect consequences. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, maycost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extendedperiod of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on ourresults of operations and financial condition.  New technologies could result in the development of new products by ourcompetitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations and financial condition. Our product range and new product development program are focused on discrete, logic and analogsemiconductor products. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delay development of new products, which could resultin a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. This includes thedevelopment of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace, discrete semiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability todesign, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfullyidentify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner.   -12-Table of ContentsProducts or technologies developed by other companies may render ourproducts or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor manufacturerwith a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize onany fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm our relationships with our customers. Inaddition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results ofoperations and financial condition.  We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technologysystems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions.We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrativeactivities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) couldresult in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physicalor electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systemsand infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before thevolume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other information technology systems. These and anyother upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be noassurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of ourdata from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.  A significant portion of our operations operate on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERPsystem, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure.It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on ERP systems different from ours and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERPsystem or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-partytechnology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From timeto time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technology that is important to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we licensetheir patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challengingthe validity of our patents, regardless of its merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherentuncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling we could be required to:      pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;     cease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;     discontinue the use of infringing technology;      expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;     pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;  -13-Table of Contents   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or atall; or      relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwiseunenforceable.  We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts andequipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, parts andequipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials, parts orequipment were to increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performanceissues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond ourdetection or control. Any interruption in, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results of operations and financialcondition.  In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also beadversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. From time to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We have nolong-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us at anytime. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly with us and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.  If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete,results of operations and financial condition.  We are continuing to vertically integrate our business.Key elements of this strategy include continuing to expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expand our wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, product development,package development and assembly/test operations in Company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:     difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenance and management of manufacturingfacilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;      difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from our United States(U.S.) headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;      the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;     less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;     even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafers from our captive manufacturing facilities, which may resultin us having higher costs than our competitors;      difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and     difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology. The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of the fixedcosts associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our abilityto compete, profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.  Part of our growth strategyinvolves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable tosuccessfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementary product lines, customers orother capabilities. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired FabTech, Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into the analog market,(iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc. and (iv) in 2008, we acquired Zetex plc. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we arein various stages of preliminary discussions, and we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable  -14-Table of Contentsacquisition candidates, or we may be unable to consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies or their operationsor product lines with our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we maynot realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:     unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;     bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;     coordinating our new product and process development;     hiring additional management and other critical personnel;     increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;     difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;     difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;     diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and     adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to a variety ofU.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing our productsthroughout the world. Some of these regulations in the U.S. include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutesand regulations. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantlyincrease, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation ofoperations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from ourmanufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may beclassified as toxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which we could be liable.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, aswell as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liabilityinvolved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmental requirements may also limitour ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us to incuradditional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities.  Our products may be found to be defective and,as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results of operations and financial condition. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods inwhich they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several cents, whereas the computer maker might sell the personal computer for several hundred dollars. Although we maintainrigorous quality control systems, we shipped approximately 29 billion, 28 billion and 21 billion individual semiconductor devices in years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to customers around the world, and in theordinary course of our business, we receive warranty claims and product liability claims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise tofailures in the end-products that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the productsinvolved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we maychoose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issuein our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy all possiblewarranty claims and product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business, reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition.   -15-Table of ContentsWe may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, financeand management personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, marketing,finance and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, finance and managerial employeesor be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition for qualified technical andother personnel in China, where our assembly, test and packaging facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in the semiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing toestablish factories and plants in China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  We may not be ableto maintain our growth or achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requires effective planning andmanagement. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we willneed to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profit growth or achieve futuregrowth, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Obsolete inventoriesas a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our productsare designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affectedby obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restricthow far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus,adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If OEMs do not design our products intotheir applications, our net sales may be adversely affected.  We expect an increasingly significantportion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Without designwins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of itsproduct platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customer does notensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer, and we may be unable to convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stopusing our products, if, for example, its own products are not commercially successful.  We are subject to interest raterisk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have credit facilities with financial institutions in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as other debt instruments,with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiated margin. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. An increase of 1% in interest rates on our creditfacilities would increase our annual interest rate expense by less than $1 million.   -16-Table of ContentsWe may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutionsworldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such debt. We may have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements in our borrowings, including our creditfacilities with various financial institutions worldwide. On February 1, 2012, we obtained a three-year term loan in the amount of $40 million with Bank of America, N.A. As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate outstanding debt of $8million and $3 million used for import and export guarantees under our credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide. In addition, an aggregate amount of $56 million is available for future borrowings under our credit facilities inthe U.S., Asia and Europe, and we are permitted under the terms of our debt agreements under various credit facilities to incur substantial additional debt.  A significant amount of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:      making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;     resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, whichevent of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility, could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assetssecuring that debt;      reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, andlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;      subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowingsunder senior secured credit facility;      limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which weoperate and the general economy; and      placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditionand our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.  Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit ourbusiness and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. On November 25, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as subsequently modified, whichprovides for a $10 million revolving credit facility, a $10 million uncommitted facility and a three-year $40 million term loan for our general corporate purposes. This Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business and financial activities. Theserestrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and undertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants placeon us include limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolve or merge or consolidate with or into another entity, dispose of certain property, make restricted payments, issue or sell equity interests,engage in other different material lines of business, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations and use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit to othersfor the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a quick ratio.  Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks stated in thissection of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owedunder such Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments for the credit facilities and repay the principal amount of the credit facilities. SeeManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Debt instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information. The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and theactual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.  Certain of our employees in the U.K., Germany and Taiwan participate in Company sponsored defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plan in the U.K. is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respectto future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earningvalue of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While webelieve the underlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differmaterially from the assumptions used.   -17-Table of ContentsDue to the recent fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bondmarkets, changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plans asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations andfinancial condition.  The asset value of our defined benefit plan (the plan) has beenvolatile over the past year due primarily to wide fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets. The plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange and aredetermined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilize certain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair value determination.  As of December 31, 2011, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $110 million and the total assets in such plan were approximately $96 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded byapproximately $14 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Any fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in several keyactuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and(iii) increase our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plancould result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2009, we adopted a payment scheme with the trustees of the plan in which we paid approximately£1 million GBP every year from 2009 through 2011. We and the trustees are in discussions to extend the payment scheme through 2019.  In 2010, we established a joint venture to build a semiconductor facility in Chengdu, China. We are required to contribute at least $48 million to the joint venture during the first three years withadditional contributions thereafter, as well as a substantial amount of time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. Any failure to meet any such requirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties orrequire us to contribute additional expenses or resources and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions. Effective as of September 10, 2010, we entered into an Investment Cooperation Agreement and a Supplementary Agreementto the Investment Cooperation Agreement (collectively, the CDHT Agreements) with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (CDHT) to build a facility in Chengdu, China, with a Chinese localpartner, for surface mount component production, assembly and test functions. The CDHT Agreements require us to contribute substantial capital to the joint venture, including at least $48 million in installments during the first three years, as wellas time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. We must obtain various licenses, permissions, certifications and approvals, from time to time, related to the joint ventures business operations. Any failure to meet any suchrequirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties, or require us to cease of operations, or contribute additional expenses and/or resources and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our operatingefficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions. As of December 31, 2011, we have invested approximately $25 million of which $18 million were for capital expenditures. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conducts, which may include certain restrictionsthat may substantially increase the cost of our business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct(EICC) or their own codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the lawsof the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we will have to promptly implement such newprovisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and results of operations. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may losefurther business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers codes of conduct, there can be noassurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.   -18-Table of ContentsThere are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimatelynot be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.  The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense in integrating the operationsand personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products and process development, the ability to hire additional management andother critical personnel, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducing costs, prolonged diversionof our managements attention from the management of our business, the ability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances maymake integration slower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assetsthat may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future.  If we fail to maintain an effective system ofinternal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our CommonStock.  Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and areimportant in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications orchanges to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness ofinternal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internalcontrols or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. which could harm our financialcondition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price. Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the United States or internationally, mayaffect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations and financial condition.  Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the marketsin which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affectour physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials and finished goods to or from ourmanufacturing facilities in China and Germany and our wafer fabrication facilities in Missouri and the U.K., or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic marketsgenerally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations.  We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas in China. In2011, 2010 and 2009, net sales to customers outside the U.S. represented 83%, 78% and 83%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to ourbusiness:      changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufactureor sell our products;      compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;     trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;     changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;     difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;     currency exchange rate fluctuations;   -19-Table of Contents   restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.;     the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan and the U.S.;     legal, regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;     longer customer payment terms; and      changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations.  We have significant operations and assets in China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions,which may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  We have a significantportion of our assets in mainland China, United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating totaxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations and financial performance are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that ouroperations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would requireadditional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.  Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between or among China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitionson our operations or the sale of our products or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existinglaws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction overparticular parties or transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the U.S. could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictions and to generate profits. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.  We believe that an increase in demandin China for electronic devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, there can be no assurance that such growth will continue. Any weaknessin the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devices containing our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in China. In addition, in 2011 33% of our total sales were billed to customersin China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulategrowth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China and, thereby, have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.  We could be adversely affected byviolations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.  The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdoms Bribery Act 2010 (the UK Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictionsgenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts ofthe world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning FCPA, the UK Bribery Actand related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal actscommitted by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminalor civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.   -20-Table of ContentsWe are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the ChineseYuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the othercurrencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, we will experience acurrency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact and be increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and results ofoperations as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impactupon our financial results, especially as the portion of our sales attributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses asthese currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.  China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change,which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to other countries,and any increase in labor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annual increase in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change,there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any future increase in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts and may occur multipletimes in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social, political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes inChinese labor laws and regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China. Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could be disrupted. Many of our suppliers arecurrently dealing with labor shortages in China, which may result in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their labor costs that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New orrevised government labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs to rise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These events could have a material adverse impact on ourproduct availability and quality, which would affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Wemay not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income.  As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we received preferential tax treatment. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Anachip Corp., we also receivepreferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducingour net income.  The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject toUnited States income taxes, thus reducing our net income.  With the establishment of our holdingcompanies in 2007 and 2011, we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvest overseas all earnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. Thiswas the case during the first quarter of 2009, in which we repatriated approximately $29 million of accumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resulting in additional non-cash U.S. federal and state income tax expense ofapproximately $5 million.  As of December 31, 2011, accumulated and undistributed earnings of oursubsidiaries in China were approximately $212 million, which we consider as a permanent investment.  As ofDecember 31, 2011, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately $265 million (including approximately $33 million of restricted earnings, which are not available for dividends). Additional U.S. federal and stateincome taxes of approximately $45 million would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. We may be required to payU.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed.   -21-Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results from quarter toquarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly results include:      strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;     general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;     seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;     the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;     product obsolescence;      the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;     the cyclical nature of the demand for our customers products;     our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;     changes in manufacturing yields;      adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and     the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful to investorsand our results of operations for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price. We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect theprice of our Common Stock.  As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospectsthat would implement our vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminarydiscussions, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:      use a significant portion of our available cash;      issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;     incur substantial debt;      incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;     incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and     incur large, immediate accounting write-offs. Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead toconflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters.  Ourdirectors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 27% of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011.These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. Thiscontrol may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.  LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 18% (approximately 8 million shares) of our Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interestbecause of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Raymond Soong, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the Chairman of LSC, and is the Chairman of Lite-On Technology Corporation, a significant shareholder of LSC. C.H.Chen, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Vice Chairman of LSC and Lite-On Technology Corporation. Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, our President and Chief Executive Officer and amember of our Board of Directors, is a member of the Board of Directors of Lite-On Technology Corporation. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, serves as a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directorsand executive officers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directors and executive officers, could create,or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection  -22-Table of Contentswith decisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, LSC accounted for less than 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively,of our net sales. Also, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 5%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales were from products manufactured by LSC, making LSC our largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products. We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, the resolution may beless favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party.  We were formed in 1959, and our early corporaterecords are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have had several transferagents over the past 50 years. In addition, our early corporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purportingto arise during periods for which our records are incomplete.  Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equityexchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges inaccordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our business activities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock inlarge quantities and will subsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously received shares of our Common Stock in such transactions. Any sales in the public market of the newly issued CommonStock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges may encourage short selling because such utilization could depress the price of ourCommon Stock.  Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation andBylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt.  Some provisions of Delaware law, ourcertificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held bystockholders.  Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporation and aninterested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provisionprohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless:   (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by thecorporations board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;    (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officersor by certain employee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or    (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stockthat is not owned by the interested stockholder.  For this purpose, business combinationsinclude mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions that wouldincrease the interested stockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation.   -23-Table of ContentsCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights andpreferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attemptto obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.   "

           Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully considerthe following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock.Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risksare realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adverselyaffect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks oruncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose partor all of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSThe success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of thefinancial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on ourrevenues, results of operations and financial condition.          Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumerdiscretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumerelectronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline inend-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers tomeet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existingorders. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected bysuch actions.During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues may havea negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding ourutilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met byour own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments we could be faced with adecline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in productdemand. During such periods, our fabrication plants do not operate at full capacity and the costsassociated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory.This was the case at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009 when our utilization rates declined toabnormally low production levels, which resulted in lower gross margins. The market conditions inthe future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins,and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significanteconomic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excessinventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, thesemiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resultingin significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at computer and telecommunicationsequipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. Themarket for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturnsin the future, which may harm our results of operations and reduce the value of our business.          In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as aresult, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to thebroader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our resultsof operations than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. Inaddition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations insales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with theintroduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in theconsumer electronics, computing, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. These end-usermarkets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensifiedcompetition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, productperformance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in variousmarkets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources orcapabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, researchand development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be betterable to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstandadverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad linesemiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than wedo. In addition, companies not currently in direct - 13 - Table of Contentscompetition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current majorcompetitors are Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., InternationalRectifier Corporation, ON Semiconductor Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Rohm Electronics USA,LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to competesuccessfully in the future, and competitive pressures may harm our business, results of operationsand financial condition.We receive a significant portion of our net sales from two customers. In addition, one of thesecustomers is our largest external supplier and both are related parties. The loss of thesecustomers or suppliers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.          In 2010, 2009 and 2008, LSC, our largest stockholder and one of our largest customers,accounted for 1.1%, 2.1% and 3.5%, respectively, of our net sales. LSC is also our largestsupplier, providing us with discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, whichrepresented approximately 6.9%, 6.3% and 9.6%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2010, 2009 and2008. In addition, in 2010, 2009 and 2008, we sold products to companies owned by Keylink,totaling 2.5%, 2.6% and 0.8%, respectively. Also for 2010, 2009 and2008, 1.9%, 1.2% and 1.3%,respectively, of our net sales were from semiconductor products purchased from companies owned byKeylink.          The loss of LSC as either a customer or a supplier, or Keylink as a customer, or anysignificant reductions in either the amount of products LSC supplies to us, or the volume of ordersLSC or Keylink places with us, could materially harm our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.Delays in initiation of production at facilities, implementing new production techniques orresolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect ourmanufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.          Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our futureprofitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Ourmanufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and arecontinually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance. Difficultiesin the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead toproduction delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achievingacceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existingfacilities, building new facilities, problems in bringing other new manufacturing capacity to fullproduction or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints,production delays and a loss of future revenues and customers. Our operating results also could beadversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases inproduction capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline indemand for our products.          Our wafer fabrication facilities are located near Kansas City, Missouri, and Manchester,England, while our facilities in Shanghai, China and Neuhaus, Germany perform packaging, assemblyand testing functions and our fourth facility is being developed in Chengdu, China for the purposeof providing surface mounted component production, assembly and testing, and integrated circuitassembly and testing. Any disruption of operations at these facilities could have a materialadverse effect on our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors toreduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.          Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial andcontinuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remaincompetitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our coststhrough product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customersshipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supplyand production. We experienced a increase in average selling prices (ASP) for our products of5.6% in 2008, a decrease of 2.1% in 2009 and an increase of 5.1% in 2010. At times, we may berequired to sell our products at ASPs below our manufacturing cost or purchase price in order toremain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if we cannoteffectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive.Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process withoutany assurance of product sales, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operationsand financial condition.          Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensivequalification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process maycontinue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does notensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales ofa product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the device, changes in the devices manufacturingprocess or the selection of a new - 14 - Table of Contentssupplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in usholding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additionalsix months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices thatincorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, includingdesign, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products withcustomers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of ourproducts with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product tothe customer, which may impede our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. Highvolumes of order cancellation or reductions in quantities ordered could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.          All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with nopenalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuantto long-term supply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery.The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and thesemiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter lead-times, which isthe amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requiresshipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods ofexcess inventory due to changes in demand in the end markets our industry serves. As a result,many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and withlittle or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfillingthese orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of orders arecancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generatereplacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our results of operations and financialcondition may suffer.Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which couldprevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customersdemands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including labor shortages, fire,natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, disease,strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilitieswith sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or maytake a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business andfinancial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our productsfor an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption,and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek othersuppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decreasein demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes indemand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results of operations andfinancial condition.          Our product range and new product development program is focused on discrete, logic and analogsemiconductor products. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changesin existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materiallydelay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss ofmarket share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changingtechnologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. Thisincludes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies,such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace discretesemiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop,manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timelyand cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profitmargins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring newproducts to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely andcost-effective manner.Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologiesobsolete or noncompetitive and, since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broadersemiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-linesemiconductor manufacturer with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of ourcompetitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering andresearch and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on anyfundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harmour business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry andharm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue toreduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able toaccomplish these goals, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, results ofoperations and financial condition. - 15 - Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which couldadversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all ofour major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage andreplenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our salesactivities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities.A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period(arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume ofbusiness, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory andsupplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships.Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses,physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There canbe no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on ourcash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve andupgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of oursystems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us tocommit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our businessincreases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we haveupgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other informationtechnology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or newtechnology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted fromour core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance thatthe time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages ordelays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith),or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have amaterial adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          All of our operations, other than Diodes FabTech Inc. and Diodes Zetex Limited, operate on asingle technology platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, werely heavily on our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, internal electronic information andcommunications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systemsare subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general systemfailure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on ERP systems different fromours and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of newacquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or localfailures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cashflows, results of operations and financial conditionWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and reduction inour intellectual property rights.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert,patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license theirpatents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our productsinfringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractualindemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless ofits merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management andtechnical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues andinherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverseruling we could be required to:  Ø pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;   Ø cease the manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;   Ø discontinue the use of infringing technology;   Ø expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;   Ø pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replaceinfringing technology with non-infringing technology;   Ø license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not beavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or   Ø relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patentclaims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable. - 16 - Table of ContentsWe depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, aswell as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results ofoperations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequatesupplies in a timely manner.          Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, partsand equipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adverselyaffected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in atimely manner or if the costs of raw materials, parts or equipment were to increase significantly.Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the qualityof raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility orperformance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns orproduct warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defectsmay arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. Any interruptionin, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufactureour products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results of operations andfinancial condition.          In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also beadversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. Fromtime to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due tocapacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of thesemanufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or accessto finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us atany time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly withus and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize thecost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete,profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.          We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy includecontinuing to expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expandour wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, productdevelopment, package development and assembly/testing operations in company-owned facilities orthrough the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with ourvertical integration strategy, including:  Ø difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limitedto, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees andinventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;   Ø difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because ofthe distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;   Ø the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;   Ø less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;   Ø even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafersfrom our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs thanour competitors;   Ø difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and   Ø difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology.          The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wideslowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we maynot realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued verticalintegration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete,profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary productlines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummatedesired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfullyintegrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.          A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementaryproduct lines, customers or other capabilities. For example, (i) in 2000, we acquired DiodesFabTech Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturingcapabilities, (ii) in 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into standard logic markets,(iii) in 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor and (iv) in 2008, weacquired Zetex plc. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place withrespect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminary discussions, and weintend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However,we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable toconsummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful inintegrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or ifintegration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, - 17 - Table of Contentsresults of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefitswe anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability tointegrate or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include thoseassociated with:  Ø unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;   Ø bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;   Ø coordinating our new product and process development;   Ø hiring additional management and other critical personnel;   Ø increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;   Ø difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;   Ø difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;   Ø diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and   Ø adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expensesand could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.          We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rulesand regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic,volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process both in the UnitedStates and England where our wafer fabrication facilities are located, in China and Germany whereour assembly, test and packaging facilities are located, and in Taiwan where our analog productswere produced through 2007. Some of these regulations in the United States include the FederalClean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of theseregulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to complywith environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costscould significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulationscould result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ouroperations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewatercontaining residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works orsewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may alsorequire discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified astoxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditionsfor which we could be liable.          Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating orcleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased oroperated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personalinjury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaningthat we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even theentire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interferewith ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties.Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new orexpanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of newlaws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us toincur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities.Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, product liability claims may beasserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results ofoperations and financial condition.          Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that areincorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several cents, whereas the computer makermight sell the personal computer for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorousquality control systems, we shipped approximately 27.9 billion, 19.0 billion and 18.5 billionindividual semiconductor devices in years ended at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively,to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business, we receive warrantyclaims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to publishedspecifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the endproducts that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers fromtheir customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues andprofits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilitiesmay be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we dobusiness. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we maychoose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoidprotracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as aresult of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or chooseto pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have product liability insurance, we maynot have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy allpossible product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defective - 18 - Table of Contentswould likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business,reputation, results of operations and financial condition.We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing and management personnelrequired to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business,results of operations and financial condition.          Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualifiedtechnical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise arescarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retainexisting key technical, sales, marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting,assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerialpersonnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition forqualified technical and other personnel in Shanghai, China, where our assembly, test and packagingfacilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in thesemiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing toestablish factories and plants in Shanghai, China, and the competition for qualified personnel hasincreased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or areunsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, results of operations andfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth and such growth may place astrain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.          Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requireseffective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place asignificant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial andmanagerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue totrain and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage ourgrowth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintainour profit growth or achieve future growth, which could adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles ofour products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.          The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the endproducts into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles requireus to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsoletebecause of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected byobsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated totaldemand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our productsare designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for ourproducts can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business dueto adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and,thus, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, a portion of our net sales may beadversely affected.          We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we designspecifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. Inaddition, a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. Withoutdesign wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source,which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product to them. Once an OEMdesigns another suppliers semiconductors into one of its product platforms, it is more difficultfor us to achieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform because changing suppliersinvolves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with a customerdoes not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer, and we may be unableto convert design wins into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligatedto purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example,its own products are not commercially successful.We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of workingcapital and interest expenses.          We have credit facilities with financial institutions in U.S., Asia and Europe, as well asother debt instruments, with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiatedmargin. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital andour interest expense. As of December 31, 2010, our outstanding interest-bearing debt included$134.3 million principal amount of Notes with a fixed rate of 2.25%. An increase of 1.0% ininterest rates on our credit facilities, which currently have no outstanding borrowings, wouldincrease our annual interest rate expense by approximately $0.5 million. - 19 - Table of ContentsWe had a significant amount of debt following the offering of convertible notes. Our substantialindebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition andour ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and or other debt.          Following the offering of our Notes, we had a significant amount of debt and substantial debtservice requirements. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding debt, including $134.3 millionprincipal amount of Notes with a fixed rate of 2.25%. In addition, $46.7 million is available forfuture borrowings under our credit facilities in the U.S., Asia and Europe, and we are permittedunder the terms of our debt agreements to incur substantial additional debt.          This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  Ø making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under theNotes and our other outstanding debt;   Ø resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and otherrestrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default couldresult in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of anevent of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility, couldpermit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;   Ø reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capitalexpenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our abilityto obtain additional financing for these purposes;   Ø subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on ourindebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under senior securedcredit facility;   Ø limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing ourvulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and thegeneral economy; and   Ø placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lessdebt or are less leveraged.          Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes andour other debt.          In addition, on each of October 1, 2011, 2016 and 2021, Notes holders may require us topurchase all or part of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount at which time we may not have theavailable funds necessary to purchase the Notes.Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, includingour ability to obtain additional capital in the future.          On November 25, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., asmodified by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of July 16, 2010 and the SecondAmendment to Credit Agreement dated as of November 24, 2010, and certain agreements and instrumentsrequired by such Credit Agreement to secure a $10 million revolving credit facility and a $10million uncommitted facility for our general corporate purposes.          This Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business andfinancial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business andundertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potentialbusiness or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on usinclude limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolveor merge or consolidate with or into another entity, disposition of certain property, makerestricted payments, issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines ofbusiness, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligationsand use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit toothers for the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financialratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a quick ratio.          Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risksstated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictionscould result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default under the CreditAgreement will permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owed under such Credit Agreementto be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us tobe unable to make interest payments for the credit facilities and repay the principal amount of thecredit facilities.The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, whichmay prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financialstatements could differ materially from the assumptions used.          Certain of our employees in the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan participate in Companysponsored defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plan in the U.K is closed to new entrants andis frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The - 20 - Table of Contentsretirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligibleemployee. In accounting for these plans, we are required to make actuarial assumptions that areused to calculate the earning value of the related assets, where applicable, and liabilities andthe amount of expenses to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions includethe expected return on plan assets, discount rates, and mortality rates. While we believe theunderlying assumptions under the projected unit credit method are appropriate, the carrying valueof the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recorded in theconsolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.Due to the recent fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets, changes inactuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plansasset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact onour results of operations and financial condition.          The asset value of our defined benefit plan (the plan) has been volatile over the past yeardue primarily to wide fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets. Theplan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London StockExchange and are determined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilizecertain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair value determination.          As of December 31, 2010, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $118.5 millionand total assets in such plan were approximately $93.6 million. Therefore, the plan wasunderfunded by approximately $24.9 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, orthe funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefitcosts of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan.          Any fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in severalkey actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimatedreturn on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) causevolatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements.In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions arechanged, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plancould result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cashcontribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact onour results of operations and financial condition.In 2010, we established a joint venture to build a semiconductor facility in Chengdu, PeoplesRepublic of China. We are required to contribute at least $47.5 million to the joint ventureduring the first three years with additional contributions thereafter, as well as a substantialamount of time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture. Any failure to meet anysuch requirements, delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties or require usto contribute additional expenses or resources and, as a result, could have an adverse effect onour operating efficiencies, results of operations and financial conditions.          Effective as of September 10, 2010, we entered into an Investment Cooperation Agreement and aSupplementary Agreement to the Investment Cooperation Agreement (collectively, the CDHTAgreements) with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone(CDHT) to build a facility in Chengdu, Peoples Republic of China, with a Chinese local partner,for the purpose of providing surface mounted component production, assembly and testing andintegrated circuit assembly and testing functions. The CDHT Agreements require us to contributesubstantial capital to the joint venture, including at least $47.5 million in installments duringthe first three years, as well as time and resources to establish and operate the joint venture.We must obtain various licenses, permissions, certifications and approvals, from time to time,related to the joint ventures business operations. Any failure to meet any such requirements,delays or unforeseen circumstances may cause us to incur penalties, or require us to cease ofoperations, or contribute additional expenses and/or resources and as a result, could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financialconditions.Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conducts, which mayinclude certain restrictions that may substantially increase the cost of our business as well ashave an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, results of operations and financialcondition.          Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with their codes ofconduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety,environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are notrequirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to complywith on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made toany these codes of conduct, and we will have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes,which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement andadversely affect our operational efficiencies and results of operations. If we violate any suchcode of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, wemay be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently incompliance with our customers and suppliers codes of conduct, there can be no - 21 - Table of Contentsassurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits ourcompliance with its code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss ofbusiness from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and financial conditions.There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not besuccessful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection withacquisitions.          The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things,higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integratingthe operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures andcontrols into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products andprocess development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, theability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficultiesin consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducingcosts, prolonged diversion of our managements attention from the management of our business, theability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees andcustomers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integrationslower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or anyother problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.          In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill andother intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses inour internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial resultsaccurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our CommonStock.          Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and areimportant in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate theeffectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may resultin the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls arenecessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on aregular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on theeffectiveness of internal controls including collusion, management override, and failure of humanjudgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminatebusiness risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if managementor our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in ourinternal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud whichcould harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investorconfidence and a decline in our stock price.Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the UnitedStates or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets inwhich we operate and our results of operations and financial condition.          Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whetherin the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades,the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activitiescould affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our abilityto produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or thoseof our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to orthrough which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials andfinished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China, Neuhaus, Germany and ourwafer fabrication facilities near Kansas City, Missouri, or Manchester, England, or to our regionalsales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financialand economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affectour future results of operations and financial condition. - 22 - Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSOur international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations.          We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of ourtotal net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas inChina. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, net sales to customers outside the United States represented 78.0%,82.7% and 80.2%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing businessinternationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business:  Ø changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including taxlaws in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell ourproducts;   Ø compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;   Ø trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;   Ø changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;   Ø difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;   Ø currency exchange rate fluctuations;   Ø restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the United States;   Ø the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, Taiwan, England and the United States;   Ø legal regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;   Ø longer customer payment terms; and   Ø changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations.We have significant operations and assets in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England and, as a result,will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adverselyaffect our financial performance.          We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kongand England. Our ability to operate in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England may be adverselyaffected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating totaxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and othermatters. In addition, our results of operations are subject to the economic and politicalsituations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal andregulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions mayimpose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would requireadditional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations orinterpretations.          Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions couldresult in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increasedtaxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, asignificant destabilization of relations between or among China, Taiwan, Hong Kong or England andthe United States could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of ourproducts or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as tothe application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances.Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation oflaws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities,resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties ortransactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the UnitedStates could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictionsand to generate profits.A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devicescontaining our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and prospects.We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include our productswill be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economy has grownsignificantly in recent years, there can be no assurance that such growth will continue. Anyweakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devicescontaining our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and prospects.Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and prospects.We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in China. In addition, in 2010 30.6%of our total sales were billed to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy hasexperienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In responseto these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulategrowth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or control prices.Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease thedemand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and prospects. - 23 - Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Actand similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.          The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws inother jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improperpayments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policiesmandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that mayhave experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strictcompliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staffconcerning FCPA and related anti-bribery laws. We have established procedures and controls tomonitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls andprocedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees oragents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts orinadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civilpenalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.          We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, principally theChinese Yuan, the Taiwanese dollar and the British Pound Sterling and, to a lesser extent, theJapanese Yen, the Euro and the Hong Kong dollar. Our income and expenses are based on a mix ofcurrencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affectour results of operations. Furthermore, our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars,which is our reporting currency. In the event the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency,we will experience a currency transaction loss, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact andbe increasingly influential to our overall sales, profits and results of operations as amounts thatare measured in foreign currency are translated back to U. S. dollars for reporting purposes. Ourforeign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows andcould have an adverse impact upon our financial results, especially as the portion of our salesattributable to Europe increases. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigateforeign currency exposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currenciesfluctuate against the U.S. dollar.The Peoples Republic of China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic change,which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in Chinaless advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.          Historically, labor in China has been readily available at a lower cost compared to othercountries, and any increase in labor cost in China has been consistent with the projected annualincrease in the inflation index and the amount of past labor cost increases. However, because Chinais experiencing rapid social, political and economic change, there can be no assurance that laborwill continue to be available in China at costs consistent with historical levels. Any futureincrease in labor cost in China is likely to be higher than historical and projected amounts andmay occur multiple times in any given year. As a result of experiencing such rapid social,political and economic change, China is also likely to enact new, and/or revise its existing, laborlaws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits. These changes in Chinese labor lawsand regulations will likely to have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in China.Furthermore, if China workers go on strike to demand higher wages, our operations could bedisrupted. Many of our suppliers are currently dealing with labor shortages in China, which mayresult in future supply delays and disruptions and may drive a substantial increase in their laborcosts that is likely to be shared by us in the form of price increases to us. New or revisedgovernment labor laws or regulations, strikes or labor shortages could cause our product costs torise and/or could cause manufacturing partners on whom we rely to exit the business. These eventscould have a material adverse impact on our product availability and quality, which would affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our incometax expense and reducing our net income.          As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receivedpreferential tax treatment. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Anachip, we alsoreceive preferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause usnot to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which maycause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income. - 24 - Table of ContentsThe distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject toU.S. income taxes, thus reducing our net income.          With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007, we intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. This wasthe case during the first quarter of 2009, in which we repatriated approximately $28.5 million ofaccumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resulting in additional non-cash federaland state income tax expense of approximately $5.3 million.          As of December 31, 2010, accumulated and undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Chinawere approximately $146 million, which we consider as a permanent investment.          As of December 31, 2010, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations ofapproximately $254 million (including approximately $27 million of restricted earnings, which arenot available for dividends). Additional federal and state income taxes of approximately $44million would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S.          We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to theU.S. We may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have notpreviously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our netincome in the period in which these earnings are distributed.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKVariations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile.          We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operatingresults from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability ofquarterly results include:  Ø strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;   Ø general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;   Ø seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;   Ø the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;   Ø product obsolescence;   Ø the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;   Ø the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products;   Ø our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;   Ø changes in manufacturing yields;   Ø adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and   Ø the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors.          Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is notnecessarily meaningful to investors and our results of operations for any period do not necessarilyindicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes inour stock price.We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitionsthat could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.          As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implementour vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. While we do not currentlyhave any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are invarious stages of preliminary discussions, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologiesin the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could:  Ø use a significant portion of our available cash;   Ø issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;   Ø incur substantial debt;   Ø incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;   Ø incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and   Ø incur large, immediate accounting write-offs. - 25 - Table of Contents          Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of ourCommon Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions andother corporate matters.          Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 26.6%of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that areexercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2010. These stockholders, acting together, will be ableto influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election ofdirectors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations.This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, whichcould adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.          LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 18.7% (approximately 8.4 million shares) ofour Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts ofinterest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Some of ourdirectors are LSC directors and officers, and the non-employee Chairman of our Board of Directorsis Chairman of the Board of LSC. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since 2007, servesas a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directors and executive officersown LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Board ofDirectors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directorsand executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts ofinterest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have differentimplications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection withdecisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter intowith LSC. LSC was our largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products for subsequentsale by us. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, LSC accounted for 1.1%, 2.1% and 3.5%, respectively, of ournet sales. Also, in 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 6.9%, 6.3% and 9.6%, respectively, of ournet sales were from products manufactured by LSC.          We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if wedo, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unrelated third party.We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may havedifficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stockpurporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete.          We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delawarein 1968. We have had several transfer agents over the past 50 years. In addition, our earlycorporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficultyin assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting toarise during periods for which our records are incomplete.Conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existingstockholders, including stockholders who had previously converted their notes.          To the extent we issue Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes, the conversion of some orall of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, includingstockholders who have received Common Stock upon prior conversion of the Notes. Any sales in thepublic market of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailingmarket prices of our Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage shortselling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of ourCommon Stock.Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activitiesare likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders,including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our Common Stock in such businessactivities.          We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equityexchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities andExchange Commission to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our businessactivities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and willsubsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders whopreviously received shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. Any sales in thepublic market of the newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices ofour Common Stock. In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equityexchanges as means to consummate our business activities may encourage short selling because suchutilization could depress the price of our Common Stock. - 26 - Table of ContentsThe repurchase rights and the increased conversion rate triggered by a make-whole fundamentalchange could discourage a potential acquirer.          If a fundamental change in accordance with the terms of the senior convertible notes were tooccur, the holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase the Notes. Afundamental change would include a change in control of the Company. In addition, if a make-wholefundamental change were to occur, which may include an acquisition of the Company, the conversionrate for the senior convertible notes will increase. The repurchase rights in our seniorconvertible notes triggered by a fundamental change and the increased conversion rate triggered bya make-whole fundamental change could discourage a potential acquirer.Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporationand Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt.          Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed tohave an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, includingthose attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held bystockholders.Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt.          Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delawarecorporation and an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with anyaffiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of theoutstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain businesscombinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of threeyears after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporations board ofdirectors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interestedstockholder;  (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of thecorporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or by certainemployee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interestedstockholder; or  (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors andby the affirmative vote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned bythe interested stockholder.          For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or otherdispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market valueof the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions thatwould increase the interested stockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation.Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt.          Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making itmore difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificateof incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by thestockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, includingvoting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorizedbut unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficultor to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxycontest or otherwise. - 27 - Table of Contents"

           Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully considerthe following risks and other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock.Our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risksare realized. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adverselyaffect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks oruncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose partor all of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSThe success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of thefinancial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on ourrevenues, results of operations and financial condition.          Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets can lead to lower consumerdiscretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products in the consumerelectronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. A decline inend-user demand can affect our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers tomeet their payment obligations and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existingorders. Our revenues and operating results could be negatively affected by such actions.During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues may havea negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding ourutilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met byour own manufacturing facilities. In difficult economic environments we could be faced with adecline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in productdemand. During such periods, our fabrication plants do not operate at full capacity and the costsassociated with this excess capacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory.This was the case at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009 when our utilization rates declined toabnormally low production levels, which resulted in lower gross margins. The market conditions inthe future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins,and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significanteconomic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excessinventory, which can result in rapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, thesemiconductor industry experiences order cancellations and reduced demand for products, resultingin significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at computer and telecommunicationsequipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. Themarket for semiconductors may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged downturnsin the future, which may harm our results of operations and reduce the value of our business.          In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as aresult, cyclical fluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to thebroader semiconductor market. This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our resultsof operations than compared to some of our broad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. Inaddition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations insales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and the costs associated with theintroduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand in theconsumer electronics, computer, industrial, communications and automotive sectors. These end-usermarkets also tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.- 11 - The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business,results of operations and financial condition.          The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensifiedcompetition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, productperformance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in variousmarkets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater resources orcapabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, researchand development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be betterable to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates and withstandadverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad linesemiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than wedo. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competingproducts in the future. Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild SemiconductorCorporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., International Rectifier Corporation, ON SemiconductorCorporation, Philips Electronics N.V., Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and VishayIntertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competitivepressures may harm our results of operations and financial condition.We receive a significant portion of our net sales from a single customer. In addition, thiscustomer is also our largest external supplier and is a related party. The loss of this customer orsupplier could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.          In 2008 and 2009, LSC, our largest stockholder and one of our largest customers, accounted for3.5% and 2.1%, respectively, of our net sales. LSC is also our largest supplier, providing us withdiscrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 9.6% and6.3%, respectively, of our net sales, in 2008 and 2009. The loss of LSC as either a customer or asupplier, or any significant reductions in either the amount of products it supplies to us, or thevolume of orders it places with us, could materially harm our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.Delays in initiation of production at facilities, implementing new production techniques orresolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect ourmanufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.          Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our futureprofitability, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Ourmanufacturing and testing processes are complex, require advanced and costly equipment and arecontinually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance. Difficultiesin the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or other problems could lead toproduction delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems in achievingacceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existingfacilities, building new facilities, problems in bringing other new manufacturing capacity to fullproduction or changing our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints,production delays and a loss of future revenues and customers. Our operating results also could beadversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases inproduction capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately, or in the event of a decline indemand for our products.          Our wafer fabrication facilities are located in Kansas City, Missouri, and near Manchester,England, while our facilities in Shanghai, China and Neuhaus, Germany perform packaging, assemblyand testing functions and our joint venture in Chengdu, China performs packaging functions. Anydisruption of operations at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on ourmanufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors toreduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.          Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial andcontinuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remaincompetitive and retain our customers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our coststhrough product and manufacturing improvements. We must also strive to minimize our customersshipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supplyand production. We experienced a decrease in average selling prices (ASP) for our products of6.8% in 2007, an increase of 5.6% in 2008 and a decrease of 2.1% in 2009. At times, we may berequired to sell our products at ASPs below our manufacturing cost or purchase price in order toremain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if we cannoteffectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product prices competitive.- 12 - Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process withoutany assurance of product sales, which could adversely effect on our revenues, results of operationsand financial condition.Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensivequalification process, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process maycontinue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does notensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales ofa product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the device, changes in the devices manufacturingprocess or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which mayresult in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified,it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production ofcomponents or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devotesubstantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts,toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful ordelayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude ordelay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our revenues, results of operationsand financial condition.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. Highvolumes of order cancellation or reductions in quantities ordered could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.          All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with nopenalty to the customer. Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuantto long-term supply contracts, and are booked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery.The rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and thesemiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorter lead-times, which isthe amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customer requiresshipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods ofexcess inventory due to changes in demand in the end markets our industry serves. As a result,many of our purchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and withlittle or no notice. However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfillingthese orders even though they may ultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of orders arecancelled or product quantities ordered are reduced, and we are unable to timely generatereplacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and our results of operations and financialcondition may suffer.Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which couldprevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customersdemands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, naturaldisasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, disease, strikes,transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities withsufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take asignificant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business andfinancial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our productsfor an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption,and we may not be able to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek othersuppliers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decreasein demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes indemand, which adversely affect our net sale, market share, results of operations and financialcondition.          Our product range and new product development program is focused on discrete and analogsemiconductor products. Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changesin existing technologies, either within or outside of the semiconductor market, could materiallydelay development of new products, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss ofmarket share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changingtechnologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. Thisincludes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existing technologies,such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace discretesemiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop,manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timelyand cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profitmargins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring newproducts to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely andcost-effective manner.- 13 - Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologiesobsolete or noncompetitive and, since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broadersemiconductor industry, this may have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-linesemiconductor manufacturer with a wider range of product types and technologies. Many of ourcompetitors are larger and more established international companies with greater engineering andresearch and development resources than us. Our failure to identify or capitalize on anyfundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, could harmour business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry andharm our relationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue toreduce package sizes, improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able toaccomplish these goals, which could adversely affect our net sale, market share, results ofoperations and financial condition.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which couldadversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all ofour major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage andreplenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our salesactivities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities.A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period(arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume ofbusiness, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory andsupplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships.Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses,physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There canbe no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on ourcash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve andupgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of oursystems and infrastructure. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us tocommit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our businessincreases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we haveupgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgrade other informationtechnology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or newtechnology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted fromour core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance thatthe time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages ordelays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith),or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have amaterial adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.          All of our operations, other than Diodes FabTech Inc. and Diodes Zetex Limited, operate on asingle technology platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, werely heavily on our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, internal electronic information andcommunications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systemsare subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general systemfailure. It is also possible that future acquisitions operate on ERP systems different from oursand that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of newacquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or localfailures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our cashflows, results of operations and financial conditionWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demandsthat we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and reduction inour intellectual property rights.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectualproperty rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert,patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that areimportant to our business and have demanded, and may in the future demand, that we license theirpatents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of allegations that our productsinfringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through our contractualindemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless ofits merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management andtechnical personnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues andinherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverseruling we could be required to: Ø pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;  Ø cease the manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;  Ø discontinue the use of infringing technology;  Ø expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;  Ø pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replaceinfringing technology with non-infringing technology;- 14 -  Ø license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not beavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or  Ø relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patentclaims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.          See Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our currentlegal proceedings.We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, aswell as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results ofoperations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequatesupplies in a timely manner.          Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, partsand equipment on a timely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adverselyaffected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in atimely manner or if the costs of raw materials, parts or equipment were to increase significantly.Our business could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the qualityof raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility orperformance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns orproduct warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defectsmay arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. Any interruptionin, or change in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufactureour products could adversely affect our reputation with customers, results of operations andfinancial condition.          In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also beadversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. Fromtime to time, such manufacturers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due tocapacity constraints or other factors. We have no long-term purchase contracts with any of thesemanufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or accessto finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer could discontinue supplying to us atany time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or wafers compete directly withus and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize thecost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete,profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.          We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy includecontinuing to expand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expandour wafer foundry and research and development capability and expand our marketing, productdevelopment, package development and assembly/testing operations in company-owned facilities orthrough the acquisition of established contractors. There are certain risks associated with ourvertical integration strategy, including: Ø difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limitedto, the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees andinventories and limitations on the flexibility of controlling overhead;  Ø difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because ofthe distance from our U.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;  Ø the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;  Ø less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;  Ø even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafersfrom our captive manufacturing facilities, which may result in us having higher costs thanour competitors;  Ø difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and  Ø difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology.          The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wideslowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we maynot realize the cost, operating and other efficiencies that we expect from continued verticalintegration. If we fail to successfully vertically integrate our business, our ability to compete,profit margins, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary productlines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummatedesired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfullyintegrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.          A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementaryproduct lines, customers or other capabilities. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2000, we acquiredDiodes FabTech Inc., a wafer fabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturingcapabilities, (ii) in January 2006, we acquired Anachip Corp. as an entry into standard logicmarkets, (iii) in- 15 - November 2006, we acquired the net operating assets of APD Semiconductor and (iv) in June 2008, weacquired Zetex plc. While we do not currently have any agreements or commitments in place withrespect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminary discussions, and weintend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making further acquisitions. However,we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable toconsummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful inintegrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or ifintegration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Inaddition, we may not realize all of the benefits we anticipate from any such acquisitions. Some ofthe risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits fromacquisitions that we may make include those associated with: Ø unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  Ø bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations;  Ø coordinating our new product and process development;  Ø hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  Ø increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  Ø difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;  Ø difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;  Ø diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and  Ø adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expensesand could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.          We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rulesand regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic,volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process both in the UnitedStates and England where our wafer fabrication facilities are located, in China and Germany whereour assembly, test and packaging facilities are located, and in Taiwan where our analog productswere produced through 2007. Some of these regulations in the United States include the FederalClean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of theseregulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to complywith environmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costscould significantly increase, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulationscould result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ouroperations affected by such requirements include, among others: the disposal of wastewatercontaining residues from our manufacturing operations through publicly operated treatment works orsewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and may alsorequire discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified astoxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditionsfor which we could be liable.          Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating orcleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased oroperated properties, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personalinjury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may also be joint and several, meaningthat we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even theentire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interferewith ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties.Environmental requirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new orexpanded plants. Discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of newlaws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require us toincur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpected liabilities.- 16 - Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, product liability claims may beasserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results ofoperations and financial condition.          Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that areincorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several cents, whereas the computer makermight sell the personal computer for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorousquality control systems, we shipped approximately 18.1 billion, 18.5 billion and 19.0 billionindividual semiconductor devices in years ended at December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively,to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business, we receive warrantyclaims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to publishedspecifications. Since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the endproducts that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers fromtheir customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues andprofits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilitiesmay be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we dobusiness. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we maychoose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoidprotracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as aresult of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or chooseto pay for the damages that result. Although we currently have product liability insurance, we maynot have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not have sufficient resources, to satisfy allpossible product liability claims. In addition, any perception that our products are defectivewould likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to our business,reputation, results of operations and financial condition.We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing and management personnelrequired to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business,results of operations and financial condition.          Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualifiedtechnical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise arescarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retainexisting key technical, sales, marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting,assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerialpersonnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue to face, intense competition forqualified technical and other personnel in Shanghai, China, where our assembly, test and packagingfacilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in thesemiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing toestablish factories and plants in Shanghai, China, and the competition for qualified personnel hasincreased significantly as a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or areunsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business, results of operations andfinancial condition could materially and adversely affected.We may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth and such growth may place astrain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.          Our ability to successfully grow our business within the semiconductor industry requireseffective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place asignificant strain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial andmanagerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue totrain and manage our workforce worldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage ourgrowth effectively, our business and prospects will be harmed and we will not be able to maintainour profit growth or achieve future growth, which could adversely affect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles ofour products could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.          The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the endproducts into which devices are designed. These types of end-market products with short lifecycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also becomeobsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adverselyaffected by obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in theestimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end products into whichour products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date ofmanufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and goout of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our products inventory maybecome obsolete, and thus, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.- 17 - If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, a portion of our net sales may beadversely affected.          We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we designspecifically for our customers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. Inaddition, a design win from a customer does not necessarily guarantee future sales to thatcustomer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only be able to sell our products to these OEMsas a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell a limited amount of product tothem. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of its product platforms, itis more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform becausechanging suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a designwin with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customerand we may be unable to convert design into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer isnot obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if,for example, its own products are not commercially successful.We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of workingcapital and interest expenses.          We have credit facilities with financial institutions in U.S., Asia and Europe, as well asother debt instruments, with interest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiatedmargin. A rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital andour interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, our outstanding interest-bearing debt including$135.1 million principal amount of senior convertible notes with a fixed rate of 2.25% and $296.6million under our no net cost loan. An increase of 1.0% in interest rates would increase ourannual interest rate expense by approximately $0.1 million, due to the fact that any increase ininterest expense related to our no net cost loan will be offset by interest earned on our ARSportfolio.We had a significant amount of debt following the offering of convertible notes. Our substantialindebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition andour ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and or other debt.          Following the offering of senior convertible notes in October 2006 (Notes), we had asignificant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2009, wehad outstanding debt, including $135.1 million principal amount of Notes with a fixed rate of 2.25%and $296.6 million under our no net cost loan with UBS. In addition, $58.6 million is availablefor future borrowings under our credit facilities in U.S., Asia and Europe, and we are permittedunder the terms of our debt agreements to incur substantial additional debt.          This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: Ø making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under theNotes and our other outstanding debt;  Ø resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and otherrestrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default couldresult in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of anevent of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility, couldpermit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;  Ø reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capitalexpenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our abilityto obtain additional financing for these purposes;  Ø subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on ourindebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under senior securedcredit facility;  Ø limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing ourvulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and thegeneral economy; and  Ø placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lessdebt or are less leveraged.          Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes andour other debt.          In addition, on each of October 1, 2011, 2016 and 2021, Notes holders may require us topurchase all or part of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount at which time we may not have theavailable funds necessary to purchase the Notes.Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, includingour ability to obtain additional capital in the future.          On November 25, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. andcertain agreements and instruments required by such Credit Agreement to secure a $10 millionrevolving credit facility and a $10 million uncommitted facility for our general corporatepurposes.- 18 -           This Credit Agreement contains covenants imposing various restrictions on our business andfinancial activities. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business andundertake certain financial activities and may limit our ability to take advantage of potentialbusiness or financial opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on usinclude limitations on our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dissolveor merge or consolidate with or into another entity, disposition of certain property, makerestricted payments, issue or sell equity interests, engage in other different material lines ofbusiness, conduct related party transactions, enter into certain burdensome contractual obligationsand use proceeds from any credit facility to purchase or carry margin stock or to extend credit toothers for the same purpose. The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financialratios, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a quick ratio.          Our ability to comply with the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risksstated in this section of the Annual Report. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictionscould result in a default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default under the CreditAgreement will permit Bank of America, N.A. to declare all amounts owed under such Credit Agreementto be immediately due and payable in full. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us tobe unable to make interest payments for the credit facilities and repay the principal amount of thecredit facilities.Our Auction Rate Securities (ARS) are currently illiquid, and UBS AG may not honor its part ofthe settlement agreement with us to purchase our entire ARS portfolio at any time beginning fromJune 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value.          ARS are generally short-term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through aDutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined calendarintervals. These auctions historically allowed existing investors to rollover their holdings andcontinue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securitiesat par value. Since mid-February 2008, there have been more sellers than buyers at each scheduledinterest rate auction date and parties desiring to sell their securities have been unable to do so.          We have $296.6 million of par value ARS that became illiquid during the first quarter of 2008due to the failure of the Dutch auction process. We reached a settlement with UBS AG andaffiliates (UBS AG) in the fourth quarter of 2008, which gives us the option to put the ARSportfolio back to UBS AG at any time from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value in exchangefor cash. If UBS AG does not have the financial resources, or otherwise fails to repurchase our ARSportfolio, we may be required to hold the ARS until maturity, which would negatively impact ourliquidity and working capital, and may require us to reclassify and reduce the fair market value ofour ARS and our put option. The ARS portfolio includes securities with maturity dates rangingfrom 18 to 38 years.          As part of the settlement with UBS AG, we accepted an offer of a no net cost loan with oneof its affiliates, UBS BANK USA (UBS Bank), which is collateralized by our ARS portfolio. Theno net cost loan initially allowed us to borrow up to 75% of the market value of our ARSportfolio, as determined by UBS Bank, and is subject to collateral maintenance requirements. Underthe no net cost loan, the interest rate we pay on the no net cost loan will not exceed theinterest rate earned on the pledged ARS portfolio. Subsequent to the agreement, we drew up to the75% stated value limit as determined by UBS Bank. On November 10, 2009, we received a credit lineup to the full value of our ARS portfolio. Subsequently, we drew up to the full value or $296.6million of the credit line. As of December 31, 2009, the balance of the no net cost loan was$296.6 million and classified as short-term debt.UBS BANK USA (UBS Bank) may demand full or partial repayment of our no net cost loan with theUBS Bank at any time at UBS Banks sole option and without cause, and UBS Financial Services Inc.may be unable to provide us any alternative financing on substantially same terms and conditions asthose of the no net cost loan.          On October 29, 2008, we entered into an ARS settlement with UBS AG and affiliates (UBS AG)to provide liquidity for our $296.6 million ARS portfolio. One of the terms of the ARS settlementis that we may accept an offer of a so-called no net cost loan from UBS Bank, an affiliate of UBSAG, initially for up to 75% of the market value, as determined by UBS Bank, of our ARS that wepledged as collateral to UBS Bank. On November 10, 2009, we received a credit line up to the fullvalue of our ARS portfolio. Subsequently, we drew up to the full value or $296.6 million of thecredit line. As of December 31, 2009, the balance of the no net cost loan was $296.6 million andclassified as short-term debt. The no net cost loan is a demand loan, and UBS Bank may demandfull or partial repayment of the loan at any time at UBS Banks sole option and without cause.Although the ARS settlement arrangement provides that UBS Financial Services Inc. would (i) supportus with alternative financing on substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no netcost loan, or (ii) have one of the UBS Entities repurchase our ARS portfolio at par, it ispossible that UBS Financial Services Inc. would be unable to provide us such alternative financing.Currently, although we do not expect that UBS Bank would demand full or partial repayment of ouroutstanding no net cost loan, we are unable to provide any assurance that UBS Bank would not doso, and, in case such demand of repayment is made, we are also unable to provide any assurance thatUBS Financial Services Inc. would be able to fully satisfy its obligation to provide us withalternative financing on substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no net cost loanor that a UBS Entity would repurchase our ARS portfolio at par.- 19 - The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, whichmay prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financialstatements could differ materially from the assumptions used.          Certain of our employees in the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan participate in Companysponsored defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plan in the U.K is closed to new entrants andis frozen with respect to future benefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the finalaverage compensation and service of each eligible employee. In accounting for these plans, we arerequire to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value of the relatedassets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in ourconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on plan assets, discountrates, and mortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions, under the projected unitcredit method are appropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and theactual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materiallyfrom the assumptions used.Due to the recent fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets, changes inactuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plansasset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact onour results of operations and financial condition.          The asset value of our defined benefit plan (the plan) has been volatile over the past yeardue primarily to wide fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets. Theplan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London StockExchange and are determined from time to time based on their fair value, requiring us to utilizecertain actuarial assumptions for the plans fair value determination.          As of December 31, 2009, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately $117.5 millionand total assets in such plan were approximately $88.2 million. Therefore, the plan wasunderfunded by approximately $29.3 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, orthe funded status of the plan, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefitcosts of the plan and the ongoing funding requirements of the plan.          Any fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets or changes in severalkey actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimatedreturn on the plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) causevolatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements.In the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions arechanged, the funding status of the plan may change. Any deficiency in the funding of the plancould result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future plan expense and cashcontribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact onour results of operations and financial condition.There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not besuccessful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection withacquisitions.          The risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies include, among other things,higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integratingthe operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing standards, procedures andcontrols into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our new products andprocess development, the ability to hire additional management and other critical personnel, theability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations, difficultiesin consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how, difficulties in reducingcosts, prolonged diversion of our managements attention from the management of our business, theability to clearly define our present and future strategies, the loss of key employees andcustomers as a result of changes in management and any geographic distances may make integrationslower and more challenging. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or anyother problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.          In addition, any acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill andother intangible assets that may result in significant asset impairment charges in the future.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses inour internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial resultsaccurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our CommonStock.          Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and areimportant in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate theeffectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. These evaluations may resultin the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls arenecessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on aregular basis, these controls may not always be effective.- 20 - There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls including collusion,management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures aredesigned to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effectivesystem of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firmwere to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliablefinancial reports or prevent fraud which could harm our financial condition and results ofoperations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the UnitedStates or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets inwhich we operate and our results of operations and financial condition.          Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whetherin the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades,the markets in which we operate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activitiescould affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our abilityto produce and deliver our products. Such activities could affect our physical facilities or thoseof our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attacks could cause seaports or airports, to orthrough which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the delivery of raw materials andfinished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China, Neuhaus, Germany and ourwafer fabrication facilities near Kansas City, Missouri, or Manchester, England, or to our regionalsales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financialand economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affectour future results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSOur international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations.          We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of ourtotal net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseas inChina. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, net sales to customers outside the United States represented 79.7%,80.2% and 82.7%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doing businessinternationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to our business: Ø changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including taxlaws in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell ourproducts;  Ø compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;  Ø trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and political instability;  Ø changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;  Ø difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;  Ø currency exchange rate fluctuations;  Ø restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the United States;  Ø the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China, Taiwan, England and the United States;  Ø legal regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;  Ø longer customer payment terms; and  Ø changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations.We have significant operations and assets in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England and, as a result,will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adverselyaffect our financial performance.          We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kongand England. Our ability to operate in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England may be adverselyaffected by changes in those jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating totaxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and othermatters. In addition, our results of operations are subject to the economic and politicalsituations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal andregulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions mayimpose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would requireadditional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations orinterpretations.          Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions couldresult in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increasedtaxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, asignificant destabilization of relations between or among China, Taiwan, Hong Kong or England andthe United States could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of ourproducts or the forfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as tothe application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances.Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation oflaws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities,resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or- 21 - transactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the UnitedStates could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictionsand to generate profits.A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devicescontaining our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and prospects.We believe that an increase in demand in China for electronic devices that include ourproducts will be an important factor in our future growth. Although the Chinese economyhas grown significantly in recent years, there can be no assurance that such growth will continue.Any weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for electronic devicescontaining our products and, thereby, materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and prospects.Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and prospects.We have a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in China. In addition, in 200930.4% of our total sales were billed to customers in China. In recent years, the Chinese economyhas experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. Inresponse to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures toregulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or controlprices. Such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in China or decreasethe demand for our products in China and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and prospects.We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Actand similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.          The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws inother jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improperpayments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policiesmandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that mayhave experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strictcompliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staffconcerning FCPA and related anti-bribery laws. We have set up procedures and controls to monitorinternal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that our internal controls andprocedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees oragents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts orinadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur criminal or civilpenalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.          We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Asiancurrencies, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. In addition, we sell our products in variouscurrencies and, accordingly, a decline in the value of any such currency against the U.S. dollar,which is our primary functional currency, could create a decrease in our net sales. Our foreigncurrency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could havean adverse impact upon our financial results. These currencies are principally the Chinese Yuan,the Taiwanese dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Euro, the Hong Kong dollar and the British PoundSterling. The Chinese government has taken action to permit the Yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rateto fluctuate, which may exacerbate our exposure to foreign currency risk and harm our results ofoperations. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currencyexposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuate againstthe U.S. dollar.We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our incometax expense and reducing our net income.          As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receivedpreferential tax treatment. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Anachip, we alsoreceive preferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause usnot to be able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which maycause an increase in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income.The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject toU.S. income taxes, thus reducing our net income.          With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007, we intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Although we intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings, certain unusual circumstances may require us to repatriate funds. This wasthe case during the first quarter of 2009, in which we repatriated approximately $28.5 million of- 22 - accumulated earnings from one of our Chinese subsidiaries, resulting in additional non-cashfederal and state income tax expense of approximately $10.6 million.          As of December 31, 2009, accumulated and undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Chinawere approximately $143 million, which we considered as a permanent investment.          As of December 31, 2009, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations ofapproximately $164 million (including approximately $24 million of restricted earnings, which arenot available for dividends). Additional federal and state income taxes of approximately $39million would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S.          We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to theU.S. We may be required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have notpreviously recorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our netincome in the period in which these earnings are distributed.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKVariations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile.          We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operatingresults from quarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability ofquarterly results include: Ø strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets;  Ø general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;  Ø seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;  Ø the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;  Ø product obsolescence;  Ø the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;  Ø the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products;  Ø our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabrication facilities;  Ø changes in manufacturing yields;  Ø changes in gross profit margins;  Ø adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and  Ø the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors.          Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is notnecessarily meaningful to investors and our results of operations for any period do not necessarilyindicate future performance. Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes inour stock price.We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitionsthat could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.          As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implementour vertical integration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. While we do not currentlyhave any agreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are invarious stages of preliminary discussions, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologiesin the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could: Ø use a significant portion of our available cash;  Ø issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;  Ø incur substantial debt;  Ø incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;  Ø incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and  Ø incur large, immediate accounting write-offs.          Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of ourCommon Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions andother corporate matters.- 23 -           Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 25.9%of our outstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that areexercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2009. These stockholders, acting together, will be ableto influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election ofdirectors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations.This control may delay, deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, whichcould adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.          LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 19.1% (approximately 8.4 million shares) ofour Common Stock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts ofinterest because of their positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Some of ourdirectors are LSC directors and officers, and the non-employee Chairman of our Board of Directorsis Chairman of the board of LSC. L.P. Hsu, a member of the Board of Directors since May 2007serves as a consultant to Lite-On Technology Corporation. Several of our directors and executiveofficers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC common stock. Service on our Boardof Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC common stock by our directorsand executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potential conflicts ofinterest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have differentimplications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection withdecisions involving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter intowith LSC. LSC was our largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products for subsequentsale by us. In 2008 and 2009, approximately 9.6% and 6.3%, respectively, of our net sales werefrom products manufactured by LSC. In addition to being our largest external supplier of finishedproducts in each of these periods, we sold products to LSC totaling 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively, ofour net sales during such periods, making LSC one of our largest customers.          We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if wedo, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an entirely unrelated thirdparty.We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may havedifficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stockpurporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete.          We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delawarein 1968. We have had several transfer agents over the past 50 years. In addition, our earlycorporate records, including our stock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficultyin assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting toarise during periods for which our records are incomplete.Conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existingstockholders, including stockholders who had previously converted their notes.          To the extent we issue Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes, the conversion of some orall of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, includingstockholders who have received Common Stock upon prior conversion of the Notes. Any sales in thepublic market of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailingmarket prices of our Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage shortselling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of ourCommon Stock.Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activitiesare likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders,including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our common stock in such businessactivities.          We, from time to time, may utilize non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equityexchanges in accordance with the guidance and rules promulgated by the United States Securities andExchange Commission to consummate our business activities. Such means to consummate our businessactivities will likely involve issuance of our Common Stock in large quantities and willsubsequently dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders whoreceive shares of our Common Stock in such business activities. Any sales in the public market ofthe newly issued Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock.In addition, utilizing non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges as means toconsummate our business activities may encourage short selling because such utilization coulddepress the price of our Common Stock.The repurchase rights and the increased conversion rate triggered by a make-whole fundamentalchange could discourage a potential acquirer.          If a fundamental change in accordance with the terms of the senior convertible notes were tooccur, the holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase the Notes. Afundamental change would include a change in control of the Company. In addition, if a make-wholefundamental change were to occur, which may include an acquisition of the Company, the conversion- 24 - rate for the senior convertible notes will increase. The repurchase rights in our seniorconvertible notes triggered by a fundamental change and the increased conversion rate triggered bya make-whole fundamental change could discourage a potential acquirer.Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporationand Bylaws, may hinder a take-over attempt.          Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed tohave an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, includingthose attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held bystockholders.Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law may deter a take-over attempt.          Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delawarecorporation and an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with anyaffiliates or associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of theoutstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain businesscombinations between an interested stockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of threeyears after the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in thestockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporations board ofdirectors prior to the date the interested stockholder becomes an interestedstockholder;  (ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of thecorporation (other than stock held by directors who are also officers or be certainemployee stock plans) in the transaction in which the stockholder became an interestedstockholder; or  (iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors andby the affirmative vote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned bythe interested stockholder.          For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or otherdispositions of assets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market valueof the consolidated assets or outstanding stock of the corporation, and certain transactions thatwould increase the interested stockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation.Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions may deter a take-over attempt.          Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making itmore difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificateof incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by thestockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, includingvoting rights, designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. The existence of authorizedbut unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board of Directors to render it more difficultor to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxycontest or otherwise"
1,DIOD,DIODES INC,2009-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
          Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risksand other information in this report before you decide to buy our Common Stock. Our business, financialcondition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. Additional risks anduncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operatingresults. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline andyou could lose part or all of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSGlobal economic weakness and the current financial market uncertainty has had, and is expected to continue to have through atleast 2009, a material adverse effect on our business.          The current global economic weakness, including the potential for a significant and prolonged global economicrecession, has led to lower consumer discretionary spending and demand for items that incorporate our products inthe consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and the automotive sectors. The decline inend-user demand has in turn affected our customers demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meettheir payment obligations, and the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our revenuesand operating results have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected by such actions. The current globaleconomic weakness and financial market uncertainty may last longer than we anticipated or have a greater adverseeffect on our business, including our revenues and operating results, than we anticipated.In the current difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower revenues have negatively impacted our results.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Notwithstanding our utilization of third-partymanufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. Indifficult economic environments like the one we are currently experiencing, we are generally faced with adecline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During suchperiods, our fabrication plants do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excesscapacity are expensed immediately and not capitalized into inventory. By the end of 2008, our utilization ratedeclined to abnormally low production levels compared to the end of 2007, which resulted in lower gross margins.The market conditions in the future may continue to adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently ourfuture gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could affect our operating resultsand financial condition.          The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and periodically experiences significant economic downturnscharacterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity and excess inventory, which can result inrapid erosion in average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry experiences ordercancellations and reduced demand for products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excessinventories at computer and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions,especially in the technology sector. The market for semiconductors mayexperience renewed, and possibly moresevere and prolonged downturns in the future, which may harm our results of operations and reduce the value ofour business.          In addition, we operate in a few narrow markets of the broader semiconductor market and, as a result, cyclicalfluctuations may affect these segments to a greater extent than they do to the broader semiconductor market.This may cause us to experience greater fluctuations in our results of operations than compared to some of ourbroad line semiconductor manufacturer competitors. In addition, we may experience significant changes in ourprofitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end-user markets and thecosts associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demandin the consumer electronics, computer, industrial, communications and automotive sectors. These end-user marketsalso tend to be cyclical and may also experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operatingresults and financial condition.The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business and our operating results.          The semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition fromexisting competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability,quality, reliability and customer service. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many ofwhich are larger and-14- have greater resources or capabilities as it relates to financial, marketing, distribution,brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we have. As a result,they may be better able to develop new products, market their products, pursue acquisition candidates andwithstand adverse economic or market conditions. Most of our current major competitors are broad linesemiconductor manufacturers who often have a wider range of product types and technologies than we do. Inaddition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future.Some of our current major competitors are Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G.,International Rectifier Corporation, ON Semiconductor Corporation, Philips Electronics N.V., Rohm ElectronicsUSA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. We may not be able to compete successfully in thefuture, and competitive pressures may harm our financial condition or our operating results.We receive a significant portion of our net sales from a single customer. In addition, this customer is also our largestexternal supplier and is a related party. The loss of this customer or supplier could harm our business and results ofoperations.          In 2007 and 2008, LSC, our largest stockholder and one of our largest customers, accounted for 6.2% and 3.5%,respectively, of our net sales. LSC is also our largest supplier, providing us with discrete semiconductorproducts for subsequent sale by us, which represented approximately 11.3% and 9.6%, respectively, of our netsales, in 2007 and 2008. The loss of LSC as either a customer or a supplier, or any significant reductions ineither the amount of products it supplies to us, or the volume of orders it places with us, could materially harmour business and results of operations.Delays in initiation of production at new facilities, implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associatedwith technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies.          Our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we may notbe able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency. Our manufacturing and testing processes arecomplex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improveyields and product performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Technical or otherproblems could lead to production delays, order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, any problems inachieving acceptable yields, construction delays, or other problems in upgrading or expanding existingfacilities, building new facilities, problems in bringing other new manufacturing capacity to full production orchanging our process technologies, could also result in capacity constraints, production delays and a loss offuture revenues and customers. Our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixedcosts and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increaseproportionately, or in the event of a decline in demand for our products.          Our wafer fabrication facilities are located in Kansas City, Missouri, and Oldham, England, while our facilitiesin Shanghai, China provide assembly, test and packaging capabilities. Any disruption of operations at thesefacilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of ourproducts, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.          Prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressurefrom customers to reduce the total cost of purchasing our products. To remain competitive and retain ourcustomers and gain new ones, we must continue to reduce our costs through product and manufacturing improvements.We must also strive to minimize our customers shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their othergoals for rationalization of supply and production. We experienced an increase in average selling prices (ASP)for our products of 12.1% in 2006, a decrease of 6.8% in 2007 and an increase of 5.6% in 2008 (due primarily tohigher ASPs for Zetex products). At times, we may be required to sell our products at ASPs below ourmanufacturing cost or purchase price in order to remain competitive. Our growth and the profit margins of ourproducts will suffer if we cannot effectively continue to reduce our costs and keep our product pricescompetitive.Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of productsales          Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualificationprocess, which involves rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months orlonger. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to thatcustomer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to thedevice, changes in the devices manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a newqualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After ourproducts are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volumeproduction of components or devices that incorporate our products.-15- Despite these uncertainties, we devotesubstantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifyingour products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of ourproducts with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer,which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellationor reductions in quantities ordered could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.          All of our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer.Orders are generally made on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and arebooked from one to twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking new orders can vary significantlyfrom month to month. We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, are experiencing a trend towards shorterlead-times, which is the amount of time between the date a customer places an order and the date the customerrequires shipment. Furthermore, our industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlook and periods ofexcess inventory due to changes in demand in the end markets our industry serves. As a result, many of ourpurchase orders are revised, and may be cancelled, with little or no penalty and with little or no notice.However, we must still commit production and other resources to fulfilling these orders even though they mayultimately be cancelled. If a significant number of orders are cancelled or product quantities ordered arereduced, and we are unable to timely generate replacement orders, we may build up excess inventory and ourresults of operations and financial condition may suffer.Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producingenough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands.          A disruption in production at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance orother manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism.Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially moreor may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business andfinancial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for anextended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption, and we may not beable to meet our customers needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Such disruptions could have anadverse effect on our results of operations in future reporting periods.New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for ourproducts, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which could result in a decrease innet sales and loss of market share.          Our product range and new product development program is focused on discrete and analog semiconductor products.Our failure to develop new technologies, or anticipate or react to changes in existing technologies, eitherwithin or outside of the semiconductor market, could materially delaydevelopment of new products, which couldresult in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industryis characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new productintroductions. This includes the development of new types of technology or the improvement of existingtechnologies, such as analog and digital technologies that compete with, or seek to replace discretesemiconductor technology. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture,assemble, test, market and support new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis.New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfullyidentify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them intonew customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner.          Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete ornoncompetitive and, since we operate primarily in a narrower segment of the broader semiconductor industry, thismay have a greater effect on us than it would if we were a broad-line semiconductor manufacturer with a widerrange of product types and technologies. Many of our competitors are larger and more established internationalcompanies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. Our failure to identify orcapitalize on any fundamental shifts in technologies in our product markets, relative to our competitors, couldharm our business, have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry and harm ourrelationships with our customers. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce package sizes,improve manufacturing yields and expand our sales. We may not be able to accomplish these goals, which couldharm our business.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems.          Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major-16- businessfunctions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and shipcustomer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services andto coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems forany prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in ourvolume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and suppliesor filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might bedamaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins andsimilar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costswill not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.          As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems andinfrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. The expansionof our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technicalresources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business willincrease. In particular, we have upgraded our financial reporting system and are currently seeking to upgradeother information technology systems. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, ornew technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our corebusiness to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resourcesour management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of anynew or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from anynew or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition orresults of operations.          All of our operations, other than Diodes FabTech Inc. and Diodes Zetex Limited, operate on a single technologyplatform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our EnterpriseResource Planning (ERP) system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems orsupport services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunicationsoutages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions operateon ERP systems different from ours and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accountingfunctions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or localfailures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we licensethird-party technology, which could result in significant expense and reduction in our intellectual property rights.          The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights.From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark andother intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded, and mayin the future demand, that we license their patents and technology. Any litigation to determine the validity ofallegations that our products infringe or may infringe these rights, including claims arising through ourcontractual indemnification of our customers, or claims challenging the validity of our patents, regardless ofits merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technicalpersonnel. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties inintellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling we could be required to:  pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;   cease the manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;   discontinue the use of infringing technology;   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;   pay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology withnon-infringing technology;   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available oncommercially reasonable terms, or at all; or   relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims areheld invalid or otherwise unenforceable.We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, as well as finished productsfrom other manufacturers, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequatesupplies in a timely manner.          Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment on atimely basis from third parties. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable toobtain adequate supplies of raw materials, parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of rawmaterials, parts or equipment were to-17- increase significantly. Our business could also be adversely affected ifthere is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materialsgive rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase incustomer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors ordefects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. Any interruption in, orchange in quality of, the supply of raw materials, parts or equipment needed to manufacture our products couldadversely affect our business and harm our results of operations and our reputation with our customers.          In addition, we sell finished products from other manufacturers. Our business could also be adversely affectedif there is a significant degradation in the quality of these products. From time to time, such manufacturersmay extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We haveno long-term purchase contracts with any of these manufacturers and, therefore, have no contractual assurances ofcontinued supply, pricing or access to finished products that we sell, and any such manufacturer coulddiscontinue supplying to us at any time. Additionally, some of our suppliers of finished products or waferscompete directly with us and may in the future choose not to supply products to us.If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencieswe anticipate and our ability to compete, profit margins and results of operations may suffer.          We are continuing to vertically integrate our business. Key elements of this strategy include continuing toexpand the reach of our sales organization, expand our manufacturing capacity, expand our wafer foundry andresearch and development capability and expand our marketing, product development, package development andassembly/testing operations in company-owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors.There are certain risks associated with our vertical integration strategy, including:  difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing business, including, but not limited to, the maintenanceand management of manufacturing facilities, equipment, employees and inventories and limitations on the flexibility ofcontrolling overhead;   difficulties in continuing expansion of our operations in Asia and Europe, because of the distance from ourU.S. headquarters and differing regulatory and cultural environments;   the need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;   less flexibility in shifting manufacturing or supply sources from one region to another;   even when independent suppliers offer lower prices, we would continue to acquire wafers from our captivemanufacturing facility, which may result in us having higher costs than our competitors;   difficulties developing and implementing a successful research and development team; and   difficulties developing, protecting, and gaining market acceptance of, our proprietary technology.          The risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer are amplified in an industry-wide slowdown because of thefixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not realize the cost, operating andother efficiencies that we expect from continued vertical integration. If we fail to successfully verticallyintegrate our business, our ability to compete, profit margins and results of operations may suffer.Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. Wemay be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make anyacquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations.          A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies with complementary product lines,customers or other capabilities. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2000, we acquired Diodes FabTech Inc., a waferfabrication company, in order to have our own wafer manufacturing capabilities, (ii) in January 2006, we acquiredAnachip Corp. as an entry into standard logic markets, (iii) in November 2006, we acquired the net operatingassets of APD Semiconductor and (iv) in June 2008, we acquired Zetex plc. While we do not currently have anyagreements or commitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages ofpreliminary discussions, and we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations by making furtheracquisitions. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unableto consummate a desired acquisition. To the extent we do make acquisitions, if we are unsuccessful inintegrating these companies or their operations or product lines with our operations, or if integration is moredifficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize all of the benefits weanticipate from any such acquisitions. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anyanticipated benefits from acquisitions that we may make include those associated with:  unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company;   bringing the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls into conformance with ouroperations;-18-   coordinating our new product and process development;   hiring additional management and other critical personnel;   increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;   difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;   difficulties in reducing costs of the acquired entitys business;   diversion of managements attention from the management of our business; and   adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.          See Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our current legal proceedings.We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses.          We are subject to a variety of U.S. Federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulationsrelated to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardouschemicals used in our manufacturing process both in the United States and England where our wafer fabricationfacilities are located, in China and Germany where our assembly, test and packaging facilities are located, andin Taiwan (where our analog products were produced through 2007). Some of these regulations in the United Statesinclude the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes and regulations. Any of theseregulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply withenvironmental regulations. If we were to incur such additional expenses, our product costs could significantlyincrease, materially affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure tocomply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension ofproduction or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. Our operations affected by such requirements include, amongothers: the disposal of wastewater containing residues from our manufacturing operations through publiclyoperated treatment works or sewer systems, and which may be subject to volume and chemical discharge limits andmay also require discharge permits; and the use, storage and disposal of materials that may be classified astoxic or hazardous. Any of these may result in, or may have resulted in, environmental conditions for which wecould be liable.          Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contaminationon, or emanating from, our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties, as well as for damages toproperty or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may alsobe joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liabilityinvolved, or even the entire liability. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could alsointerfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties. Environmentalrequirements may also limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants. Discovery ofcontamination for which we are responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existingrequirements are enforced, could require us to incur additional costs for compliance or subject us to unexpectedliabilities.Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us, which mayharm our business and our reputation with our customers.          Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or othergoods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computermay be sold for several cents, whereas the computer maker might sell the personal computer for several hundreddollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we shipped approximately 14.5 billion, 18.1billion and 18.5 billion individual semiconductor devices in years ended at December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,respectively, to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business, we receive warrantyclaims for some of these products that are defective, or that do not perform to published specifications. Sincea defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them (andconsequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages thatare disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. In addition, our abilityto reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries wherewe do business. Even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose topay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Ourresults of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality orperformance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. Although wecurrently have product liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not havesufficient resources, to satisfy all possible product liability claims. In addition, any perception that ourproducts are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products, loss of customers and harm to ourbusiness and reputation.-19- We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing and management personnel required to operateourbusiness successfully.          Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales,marketing and managerial personnel. Personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition forpersonnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketingand managerial employees or be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining other highly qualifiedtechnical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel in the future. For example, we have faced, and continue toface, intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in Shanghai, China, where our assembly,test and packaging facilities are located. A number of U.S. and multi-national corporations, both in thesemiconductor industry and in other industries, have recently established and are continuing to establishfactories and plants in Shanghai, China, and the competition for qualified personnel has increased significantlyas a result. If we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highlyqualified employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially andadversely affected.We may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth and such growth may place a strain on our management andon our systems and resources.          Our ability to successfully grow our business within the discrete and analog semiconductor markets requireseffective planning and management. Our past growth, and our targeted future growth, may place a significantstrain on our management and on our systems and resources, including our financial and managerial controls,reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we will need to continue to train and manage our workforceworldwide. If we are unable to effectively plan and manage our growth effectively, our business and prospectswill be harmed and we will not be able to maintain our profit growth or achieve future growth.Our business may be adversely affected by obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and changein life cycles of our products.          The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products into whichdevices are designed. These types of end-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely ourproduction and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-marketdemand such as the recent drop in demand of our products due to the global economic downturn. We may in thefuture be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in theestimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our productsare designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can beand certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to the adverse economicconditions; therefore, some of our products inventory may become obsolete, and thus, adversely affect our resultsof operations.If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, a portion of our net sales may be adversely affected.          We expect an increasingly significant portion of net sales will come from products we design specifically for ourcustomers. However, we may be unable to achieve these design wins. In addition, a design win from a customerdoes not necessarily guarantee future sales to that customer. Without design wins from OEMs, we would only beable to sell our products to these OEMs as a second source, which usually means we are only able to sell alimited amount of product to them. Once an OEM designs another suppliers semiconductors into one of its productplatforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that OEMs product platform becausechanging suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk to an OEM. Achieving a design win with acustomer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer and we may be unable toconvert design into actual sales. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase ourproducts and can choose at any time to stop using our products, if, for example, its own products are notcommercially successful.We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses.          We have credit facilities with financial institutions in Asia and Europe, as well as other debt instruments, withinterest rates equal to LIBOR or similar indices plus a negotiated margin. A rise in interest rates could havean adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense. As of December 31, 2008, ouroutstanding interest-bearing debt was $402.0 million, including $183.5 million senior convertible notes with afixed rate of 2.25% and $212.7 million under our no net cost loan. An increase of 1.0% in interest rates wouldincrease our annual interest rate expense by approximately $0.1 million due to the fact that any increase ininterest expense related to our no net cost loan will be offset by interest earned on our ARS portfolio.-20- We had a significant amount of debt following the offering of convertible notes. Our substantial indebtedness could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operationsand our ability to meet our payment obligations under thenotes and or other debt.          Following the offering of senior convertible notes in October 2006 (Notes), we had a significant amount of debtand substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2008, we had $402.0 million of outstanding debt,including $183.5 million Notes with a fixed rate of 2.25% and $212.7 million under our no net cost loan withUBS. In addition, $46.5 million is available for future borrowings under our credit facilities in Asia andEurope, and we are permitted under the terms of our debt agreements to incur substantial additional debt.          This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the notes and our otheroutstanding debt;   resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenantscontained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due andpayable and, in the case of an event of default under our secured debt, such as our senior secured credit facility,could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing that debt;   reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions andother general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;   subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness withvariable interest rates, including borrowings under senior secured credit facility;   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in ourbusiness, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are lessleveraged.          Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and our other debt.          In addition, on each of October 1, 2011, 2016 and 2021, Notes holders may require us to purchase all or part ofthe Notes at 100% of the principal amount at which time we may not have the available funds necessary to purchasethe Notes.Our Auction Rate Securities (ARS) are currently illiquid and we cancelled our bank credit facility in the U.S.; therefore,we must rely solely upon existing cash reserves, available foreign credit facilities and funds from existing operations tofinance future operations.          We have $320.6 million of par value ARS that became illiquid during the first quarter of 2008 due to the failureof the Dutch auction process. We reached a settlement with UBS AG in the fourth quarter of 2008, which allows usto put the ARS back to UBS AG at any time from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value. As part of thesettlement, we entered into a no net cost loan that allows us to borrow up to 75% of the market value of theARS portfolio, as determined by UBS AG. As of December 31, 2008, we have drawn $213 million, which was 75% ofthe market value upon time of the draw. Although we are not required to repay the loan, we are unable to drawadditional funds until the ARSs market value, as determined by UBS AG, exceeds 75% or until June 30, 2010 whenwe can put the ARS back to UBS AG.          On February 6, 2009, we paid in full the outstanding balance of approximately $2.5 million on our revolvingcredit commitment with Union Bank and terminated the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that governed therevolving credit commitment. On February 11, 2009, we paid in full the outstanding balance of approximately $1.8million on our Union Bank term loan facility and terminated the Covenant Agreement that governed that facility,which was scheduled to mature on August 29, 2010.          As of December 31, 2008, our Asia and Europe subsidiaries have available lines of credit of up to an aggregate of$49.4 million, with several financial institutions. These lines of credit, except for one Taiwanese creditfacility, are collateralized by each subsidiarys premises, are unsecured, uncommitted and, in some instances,must be repaid on demand. Loans under these lines of credit bear interest at LIBOR or similar indices plus aspecified margin. At December 31, 2008, $6.1 million was outstanding on these lines of credit, and the averageinterest rates ranged from 2.0% to 2.8%.UBS AG may not honor its part of the settlement agreement with us to purchase our entire ARS portfolio at any time beginningfrom June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value.          ARS are generally long-term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through a Dutch auctionprocess that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined calendar intervals. These auctionshistorically allowed existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respectivesecurities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value. Since mid-February 2008, therehave been more sellers than buyers at each scheduled-21- interest rate auction date and parties desiring to selltheir securities have been unable to do so.          On October 29, 2008, we reached an agreement with UBS AG in regard to our ARS portfolio, which gives us the rightto sell, which we refer to as the option to put, the $320.6 million ARS portfolio back to UBS AG at any timebeginning from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value. If UBS AG does not have the financial resources torepurchase our $320.6 million ARS portfolio, we may be required to hold the ARS until maturity, which wouldnegatively impact our liquidity and working capital, and may require us to reclassify and reduce the fair marketvalue of our ARS and our put option. The ARS portfolio includes securities with maturity dates ranging from 19to 39 years.UBS BANK USA (UBS Bank) may demand full or partial repayment of our no net cost loan with the UBS Bank at any time at UBSBanks sole option and without cause, and UBS Financial Services Inc. may be unable to provide us any alternative financingon substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no net cost loan.          On October 29, 2008, we entered into an ARS settlement with UBS AG to provide liquidity for our $320.6 millionARS portfolio. One of the terms of the ARS settlement is that we may accept an offer of a so-called no netcost loan from UBS Bank for up to 75% of the market value, as determined by UBS Bank, of our ARS that we pledgedas collateral to UBS Bank. However, the no net cost loan is a demand loan, and UBS Bank may demand full orpartial repayment of the loan at any time at UBS Banks sole option and without cause. Although the ARSsettlement arrangement provides that UBS Financial Services Inc. would (i) support us with alternative financingon substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no net cost loan, or (ii) have on of the UBSEntities repurchase our ARS portfolio at par, it is possible that UBS Financial Services Inc. would be unable toprovide us such alternative financing, particularly under the present and potentially prolonged condition ofglobal economic recession and financial market turmoil. Currently, although we do not expect that UBS Bank woulddemand full or partial repayment of our outstanding no net cost loan, we are unable to provide any assurancethat UBS Bank would not do so, and, in case such demand of repayment is made, we are also unable to provide anyassurance that UBS Financial Services Inc. would be able to fully satisfy its obligation to provide us withalternative financing on substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no net cost loan or that a UBSEntity would repurchase our ARS portfolio at par.The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate.          Certain of the Companys employees in the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan participate in Company sponsoreddefined benefit plan. The defined benefit plan is closed to new entrants and is frozen with respect to futurebenefit accruals. The retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligibleemployee. The Company accounts for these benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting forDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and132R), which requires the Company to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the earning value ofthe related assets, where applicable, and liabilities and the amount of expenses to be recorded in the Companysconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions include the expected return on plan assets, discount rates, andmortality rates. While we believe the underlying assumptions, under the projected unit credit method areappropriate, the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and the actual amount of expenses recordedin the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.Due to the recent and ongoing fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets, changes in actuarialassumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plans asset value, require us to increase cashcontributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability.          The asset value of the Companys defined benefit plan (the plan) has been volatile in recent months dueprimarily to wide fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets. The plan assets consistprimarily of high quality corporate bonds and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange and are determined fromtime to time based on their fair value, requiring the Company to utilize certain actuarial assumptions for theplans fair value determination.          As of December 31, 2008, the benefit obligation of the plan was approximately U.S. $83.3 million and total assetsin such plan were approximately U.S. $71.3 million. Therefore, the plan was underfunded by approximately U.S.$12.0 million. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plan, is asignificant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the plan and the ongoing funding requirementsof the plan.          Particularly due to the ongoing fluctuations in the United Kingdoms equity markets and bond markets, changes inseveral key actuarial assumptions, including, but not limited to, changes in discount rate, estimated return onthe plan and mortality rates, can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodicpension cost; and (iii) increase-22- our future funding requirements. In the event that actual results differ fromthe actuarial assumptions or actuarial assumptions are changed, the funding status of the plan may change. Anydeficiency in the funding of the plan could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future planexpense and cash contribution. A significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact onour results of operations and profitability.There are risks associated with our acquisition of Zetex.          The acquisition of Zetex is accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. Theserisks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty andexpense of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the difficulty of bringing Zetexsstandards, procedures and controls into conformance with our operations, the ability to coordinate our newproducts and process development with Zetex, the ability to hire additional management and other criticalpersonnel to better manage Zetex, the ability to increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of ouroperations with the addition of Zetex, difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes andknow-how with Zetex, difficulties in reducing costs of Zetex business, prolonged diversion of our managementsattention from the management of our business to matters related to Zetex, the ability to clearly define ourpresent and future strategies with the addition of Zetex and the loss of key employees and customers as a resultof changes in management.          In addition, geographic distances may make the integration of Zetex slower and more challenging. We mayultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with theacquisition of Zetex.          Our acquisition may cause large one-time expenses as well as create goodwill and other intangible assets that mayresult in significant asset impairment charges in the future. We have made preliminary estimates and assumptionsin order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities ofZetex. If our estimates or assumptions used to value acquired assets and liabilities of Zetex are not accurate,we may be exposed to gains or losses that may be material to our results of operations and profitability.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls overfinancial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm ourbusiness and the trading price of our Common Stock.          Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in oureffort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design andoperation of our internal controls. These evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements,modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates theeffectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There areinherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls including collusion, management override, andfailure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminatebusiness risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or ourindependent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, wemay be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud which could harm our financial condition andresults of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.Our management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2008 excluded the operations of Zetex. If we are not able to integrate Zetex operations into ourinternal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.          Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404) requires us to furnish a management certification and auditorattestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a public company, weare required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changesin internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control overfinancial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controlover financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of theregistrants annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.          Complying with SOX 404 is time consuming and costly. Prior to the acquisition, Zetex was a United Kingdom based,publicly traded company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and was not required to comply with SOX 404. Theintegration of Zetex operations into our internal control over financial reporting will require additional timeand resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs. The majority ofZetex operations are in the United Kingdom and in Germany. Such geographic distance between Zetex and our UnitedStates headquarters may-23- make the integration process of Zetex slower and more difficult. Therefore, ourmanagement certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control overfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2008 excluded the operations of Zetex.          Failure to comply with SOX 404, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate Zetex operations intoour internal control over financial reporting, or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors tolose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, and the trading price of our Common Stock may decline.If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our access to the capitalmarkets may be restricted and the trading price of our Common Stock may decline.Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the United States or internationallymay affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability.          Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities, whether in the UnitedStates or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which weoperate and our profitability. Future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic andinternational sales, disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. Suchactivities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such terrorist attackscould cause seaports or airports, to or through which we ship, to be shut down, thereby preventing the deliveryof raw materials and finished goods to or from our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China, Taiwan, KansasCity, Missouri, or Oldham, England, or to our regional sales offices. Due to the broad and uncertain effectsthat terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally, we cannot provide any estimate ofhow these activities might affect our future results.-24- RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSOur international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations.          We expect net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of ourtotal net sales. In addition, the majority of our manufacturing facilities are located overseasin China. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, net sales to customers outside the United States represented77.8%, 79.7% and 80.2%, respectively, of our net sales. There are risks inherent in doingbusiness internationally, and any or all of the following factors could cause harm to ourbusiness:  changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in theUnited States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;   compliance with trade or other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;   trade restrictions, transportation delays, work stoppages, and economic and politicalinstability;   changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates;   difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts;   currency exchange rate fluctuations;   restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign subsidiaries to the United States;   the possibility of international conflict, particularly between or among China and Taiwan andthe United States;   legal regulatory, political and cultural differences among the countries in which we do business;   longer customer payment terms; and   changes in U.S. or foreign tax regulations.We have significant operations and assets in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England and, as a result, will besubject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financialperformance.          We have a significant portion of our assets in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England. Ourability to operate in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England may be adversely affected by changes inthose jurisdictions laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and exporttariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, ourresults of operations are subject to the economic and political situations. We believe that ouroperations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, thecentral or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations orinterpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts onour part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.          Changes in the political environment or government policies in those jurisdictions could result inrevisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significantdestabilization of relations between or among China, Taiwan or Hong Kong and the United Statescould result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products or theforfeiture of our assets in these jurisdictions. There can be no certainty as to the applicationof the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement ofexisting laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of lawsinconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities,resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties ortransactions. The possibility of political conflict between these countries or with the UnitedStates could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business in these jurisdictionsand to generate profits.We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similarworldwide anti-bribery laws.          TheUnited States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictionsgenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officialsfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-briberylaws. We operate in many parts of the world that may have experienced governmental corruption to some degreeand, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs andpractices. We train our staff concerning FCPA and related anti-bribery laws. We are in the process of settingup procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. There can be no assurance that ourinternal controls and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by ouremployees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts orinadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penaltiesor other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.-25- We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.          We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Asiancurrencies, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. In addition, we sell our products in variouscurrencies and, accordingly, a decline in the value of any such currency against the U.S. dollar,which is our primary functional currency, could create a decrease in our net sales. Our foreigncurrency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and couldhave an adverse impact upon our financial results. These currencies are principally the ChineseYuan, the Taiwanese dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Euro, the Hong Kong dollar and the British PoundSterling. The Chinese government has taken action to permit the Yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rateto fluctuate, which may exacerbate our exposure to foreign currency risk and harm our results ofoperations. We do not usually employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currencyexposures and, therefore, we could experience currency losses as these currencies fluctuateagainst the U.S. dollar.We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expenseand reducing our net income.          As an incentive for establishing our manufacturing subsidiaries in China, we receive preferentialtax treatment. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Anachip, we also receivepreferential tax treatment in Taiwan. Governmental changes in foreign tax law may cause us not tobe able to continue receiving these preferential tax treatments in the future, which may cause anincrease in our income tax expense, thereby reducing our net income.The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to U.S.income taxes, thus reducing our net income.          With the establishment of our holding companies in 2007, we now intend to permanently reinvestoverseas all earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, the $3.3 million deferred taxliability was reversed during 2007 and U.S. taxes are no longer being recorded on undistributedforeign earnings.          As of December 31, 2008, accumulated and undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in China wereapproximately $106.4 million, which we considered as a permanent investment.          As of December 31, 2008, we have undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations of approximately$144 million. Additional Federal and state income taxes of approximately $41 million would berequired should such earnings be repatriated to the U.S. parent.          We may, in the future, plan to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. We maybe required to pay U.S. income taxes on these earnings to the extent we have not previouslyrecorded deferred U.S. taxes on such earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in theperiod in which these earnings are distributed.-26- RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKVariations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile.          We have experienced substantial variations in net sales, gross profit margin and operating results fromquarter to quarter. We believe that the factors that influence this variability of quarterly resultsinclude:  general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products;   seasonality and variability in the computing and communications market and our other end-markets;   the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions;   product obsolescence;   the scheduling, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers;   the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products;   our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at our fabricationfacilities;   changes in manufacturing yields;   changes in gross profit margins;   adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; and   the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers or subcontractors.          Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningfulto investors and our results of operations for any period do not necessarily indicate future performance.Variations in our quarterly results may trigger volatile changes in our stock price.We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could affectthe price of our Common Stock.          As part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would implement our verticalintegration strategy or offer other growth opportunities. While we do not currently have any agreements orcommitments in place with respect to any material acquisitions, we are in various stages of preliminarydiscussions, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of futureacquisitions, we could:  use a significant portion of our available cash;   issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership;   incur substantial debt;   incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;   incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and   incur large, immediate accounting write-offs.          Such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which maylead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters.          Our directors, executive officers and our affiliate, LSC, beneficially own approximately 36.7% of ouroutstanding Common Stock, including options to purchase shares of our Common Stock that are exercisablewithin 60 days of December 31, 2008. These stockholders, acting together, will be able to influencesignificantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors andsignificant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combinations. This control may delay,deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which could adversely affect the marketprice of our Common Stock.          LSC, our largest stockholder, owns approximately 20.2% (approximately 8.4 million shares) of our CommonStock. Some of our directors and executive officers may have potential conflicts of interest because oftheir positions with LSC or their ownership of LSC common stock. Some of our directors are LSC directorsand officers, and our non-employee Chairman of our Board of Directors is Chairman of the board of LSC.Several of our directors and executive officers own LSC common stock and hold options to purchase LSC commonstock. Service on our Board of Directors and as a director or officer of LSC, or ownership of LSC commonstock by our directors and executive officers, could create, or appear to create, actual or potentialconflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have differentimplications for LSC and us. For example, potential conflicts could arise in connection with decisionsinvolving the Common Stock owned by LSC, or under the other agreements we may enter into with LSC. LSC wasour largest external supplier of discrete semiconductor products for subsequent sale by us. In 2007 and2008, approximately 11.3% and 9.6%, respectively, of our net sales were from products manufactured by LSC.In addition to being our largest external supplier of finished products in each of these periods, we sold-27- silicon wafers to LSC totaling 6.2% and 3.5%, respectively, of our net sales during such periods, making LSCour largest customer.          We may have difficulty resolving any potential conflicts of interest with LSC, and even if we do, theresolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an entirely unrelated third party.We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessingand defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which ourrecords are incomplete.          We were formed in 1959 under the laws of California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. We have hadseveral transfer agents over the past 50 years. In addition, our early corporate records, including ourstock ledger, are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claimsrelating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records areincomplete.Conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, includingholders who had previously converted their notes.          To the extent we issue Common Stock upon conversion of the notes, the conversion of some or all of the noteswill dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who have received CommonStock upon prior conversion of the notes. Any sales in the public market of the Common Stock issuable uponsuch conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock. In addition, theexistence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of thenotes could depress the price of our Common Stock.The repurchase rights and the increased conversion rate triggered by a make-whole fundamental change could discourage apotential acquirer.          If a fundamental change in accordance with the terms of the senior convertible notes were to occur, theholders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes. A fundamental change wouldinclude a change in control of the Company. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change were to occur,which may include an acquisition of the Company, the conversion rate for the senior convertible notes willincrease. The repurchase rights in our senior convertible notes triggered by a fundamental change and theincreased conversion rate triggered by a make-whole fundamental change could discourage a potentialacquirer.Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.          Some provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have ananti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including those attemptsthat might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law          Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits transactions between a Delaware corporationand an interested stockholder, which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates orassociates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15.0% or more of the outstanding voting shares of aDelaware corporation. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an interestedstockholder and a Delaware corporation for a period of three years after the date the stockholder becomes aninterested stockholder, unless:(i) either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming aninterested stockholder is approved by the corporations board of directors prior to the date the interestedstockholder becomes an interested stockholder;(ii) the interested stockholder acquired at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation (other thanstock held by directors who are also officers or be certain employee stock plans) in the transaction inwhich the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or(iii) the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the affirmativevote of 66.66% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.          For this purpose, business combinations include mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions ofassets having an aggregate value in excess of 10.0% of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assetsor outstanding stock of the-28- corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interestedstockholders proportionate share ownership in the corporation.Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions          Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult fora third party to acquire control of our Company. In particular, our certificate of incorporation authorizesour Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares ofpreferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by theBoard of Directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our Board ofDirectors to render it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of amerger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise"
