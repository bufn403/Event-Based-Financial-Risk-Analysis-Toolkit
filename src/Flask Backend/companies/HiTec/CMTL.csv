15,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2023-10-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Summary of Risk Factors
 The following is a summary of the principal risks that could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial conditions, or operating results. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below: Global Risks•New and ongoing challenges relating to current supply chain constraints and impacts from inflation, including for satellite ground station and troposcatter components, could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and financial results. •Our business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.•If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.•We have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack or other significant disruptions (including natural disasters).•The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response to it could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. •The U.S. Government's budget deficit, as well as a breach of the debt ceiling, could have an adverse impact on our operations. Business Risks•Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification.•Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.•Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers.•Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.•Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.19•A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.•A change by wireless carrier partners in the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers could have a material adverse affect. •Disputes with our subcontractors or key suppliers or their inability to deliver on a timely basis, could cause unanticipated delays in our shipments.Strategic Growth Risks•We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business.•Loss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations and growth plans or harm our business.•We must service the debt and maintain compliance with various covenants under a Credit Facility that imposes restrictions on our business.•Acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock. •Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.Cybersecurity Risks•We could be negatively impacted by a system failure, breach, attack or intrusion of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems.•The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached.Legal, Regulatory and Litigation Risks•Changes in U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Our U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •We may be subject to environmental liabilities.•The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.•Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.•Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.•Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.•We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims. Additionally, we may become subject to government investigations, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.•Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.•Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.20Competitive Risks•All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position.•Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.•We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers.•Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Risks Related to our Common Stock•Our stock price is volatile.•Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.•Actions of activist stockholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or share price. •Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.Global RisksNew and ongoing challenges relating to current supply chain constraints and impacts from inflation, including for satellite ground station and troposcatter components, could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and financial results.The global supply chain for certain raw materials and components, including those used in our satellite ground station and troposcatter equipment, has experienced significant strain in recent periods. The constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and could further affect, availability and lead times of raw materials and components, thereby impeding our ability to meet customer demand in circumstances where we cannot timely secure supply of components that meet our quality standards. Even when raw materials and components are available, they often come with higher prices reflecting an imbalance between supply and demand, as well as inflationary pressures affecting global markets.The effects of inflation and labor challenges have caused, and we expect will continue to cause further delays in the supply chain. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, constrained supply chain conditions have and are expected to continue to adversely impact our costs of goods sold and may impact the timing and amount of revenue we realize. During fiscal 2023, we experienced disruptions in our supply chain relating to later-than-expected delivery of certain key components from several suppliers that adversely impacted our revenue in fiscal 2023. In addition, the ongoing supply chain issues have affected the quality of the components we receive. Certain parts received in fiscal 2023 did not meet our quality specifications and we were unable to use them. We obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources. Some of our single source suppliers, particularly those that provide satellite ground station and troposcatter components, have reported to us that they are having disruptions in their respective supply chains. These single source components, which include items such as cooling fans and power supplies, are in limited supply. In some cases, we have now depleted our stock inventory and we are on waiting lists to obtain additional components. In order to ship certain items during fiscal 2024, we must obtain additional components to produce certain finished goods. We continue to seek new suppliers and inventory elsewhere. In light of current challenges in the supply chain, we may not be able to qualify alternate suppliers for our components. 21Heading into our fiscal 2024, we have a significant portion of our targeted revenues in our backlog. However, if shipments from our backlog are delayed or we are unable to obtain expected orders or components, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. These aforementioned supply chain constraints, and their related challenges could result in future shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and financial results. There can be no assurance that the impacts of all the aforementioned conditions will not continue, or worsen, in the future.Our business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Historically, our business outlook is difficult to forecast and backlog (sometimes referred to herein as orders or bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; start-up costs associated with the opening of our two new high-volume technology manufacturing centers; price competition; new product introductions by us or our competitors; customer bankruptcies; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance and impact of acquisitions; new accounting standards; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); general global economic conditions, and the impact of natural disasters or global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic or political conditions could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite ground station technologies, amplifier products and mission-critical technologies that generally have short order and lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our public safety and location technologies are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions or to perform such solutions internally. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.In addition, a large portion of our consolidated net sales are derived in part from large U.S. federal and state government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict.If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have an adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.Many of the end-markets for our products and services may be significantly impacted for other issues that result in adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are in emerging and developing countries that are subject to sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their spending. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and have significantly impaired the ability of certain of our government customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, from time to time, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from many emerging and developing countries and any such reduced purchasing power of our customers could adversely impact our sales and backlog. If credit in financial markets outside of the U.S. remains difficult to obtain, our international customers and suppliers may find it difficult to obtain financing, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and increased transaction costs (e.g., insurance, performance bonds). Volatility of financing conditions may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment and could cause their projects to be postponed or canceled. In addition, if an adverse economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable and/or inventories which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.22We believe that the current global economic business environment is unstable and sudden negative changes could result in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short lead-time products. The timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are difficult to predict. If U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways. In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, Maryland, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, terrorist attack, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. Any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. We currently, and intend to continue to, operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To support our long-term business goals for our satellite earth station product line, in fiscal 2023, we completed our relocation of certain of our satellite earth station product line operations to our new 146,000 square foot facility in Chandler, Arizona. Nevertheless, loss of that facility would have a negative impact on our production capability and we would incur unexpected costs and lost revenue associated with our inability to meet our contractual commitments.We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment activities are conducted in Washington State near a fault line. We maintain operations in Maryland near a U.S. Navy facility which may be more prone to a terrorist attack. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona and our antenna production facility in the United Kingdom), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.23The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response to it could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes, export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cyber-attacks as a result of the conflict.The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted our sales pipeline and continues to have significant repercussions for our business. Although sales into Russia represented approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023 and 2022, consolidated net sales into Russia in fiscal 2024 and beyond were expected to significantly grow. As a result of the economic sanctions against Russia, however, we have stopped accepting new orders in Russia and plan to wind down operations in fiscal 2024. Accordingly, we are completing the production of backlog for approved in-country customers and repatriating cash proceeds as permitted by both U.S. and Russian law.As a result of this conflict, in fiscal 2022 and 2023, certain customers (including the U.S. and Ukrainian government) paused procurement and deployment of satellite and troposcatter communication systems, and instead began purchasing war-fighting equipment.It has become difficult to predict the timing or dollar amount of our contract awards in the region. For example, we had several opportunities to provide wireless communication systems (including troposcatter systems) to Ukraine for a variety of both defense and communications uses. Funding for these systems was expected to be provided by Ukraine and by the U.S. government and these items were expected to be awarded and shipped in the second half of fiscal 2022. As result of the conflict in Ukraine, however, the award was not received and shipped until the first half of our fiscal 2023. Additionally, funding for opportunities with other customers that we expected to book and ship has also been shifted to other programs and/or temporarily delayed as a result of changes in defense spending priorities. Prior to this conflict, we maintained a small group of employees in Moscow, Russia who supported certain UHP-branded satellite communications products. In fiscal 2023, we continued to expand our Canadian operations and shifted certain commercial software development and support activities outside of Russia. However, as we are currently in an environment where software engineering talent is already in high demand and commands a premium, we expect to incur additional annual expenses in connection with this personnel shift for our UHP products. We may not be able to timely ramp up our operations in Canada or elsewhere on a sufficient scale to support anticipated growth of our UHP products, which could adversely impact future revenues, gross margins and operations.Our sales to government customers are highly dependent on the U.S. defense budget, which in turn is driven by an annual appropriation by Congress. These appropriations rarely align with the performance period of our contracts—for instance, most of our government contracts are only partially funded at inception. DoD budgets are driven by factors that are outside our control (such as economic conditions, administration policy shifts within the Executive branch and geopolitical events). Any one or combination of these factors may adversely impact our operations, resulting in a decline of sales and operating income.Business RisksOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellations could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. For some contracts, where we are a subcontractor (and not the prime contractor), the U.S. government could terminate the prime contractor for convenience without regard for our performance as a subcontractor.24In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. Also, a significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with public safety and location technology solutions. Funding of these contracts is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, particularly during periods of economic instability. Nor can there be any assurance that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change; a customer may not follow up with order details (e.g., delivery instructions), fluctuations in currency exchange rates after an order is placed could cause our products to become too expensive for a foreign customer; a customer’s program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early due to changes in a customer’s priorities; funding may not be included in future budgets; actual indirect rates being reimbursed on U.S. government contracts may ultimately be less than those indirect rates included in our initial proposals; or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under firm fixed-price contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin could be materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $172.0 million, $132.6 million and $201.1 million or 31.3%, 27.2% and 34.6% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2024 and beyond depends, in part, on significant new orders from the U.S. government, which undergoes extreme budgetary pressures from time to time.25We rely on U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these discussions could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in DoD or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that a shutdown of the U.S. government may occur, or interim budgets may be adopted. As such, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and adverse impacts on our results of operations. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, accelerations, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. 26•Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - Our U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.•Our employees may not be able to obtain and maintain the required security clearances for the facilities in which we perform sensitive government work - Certain of our U.S. government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances. If we cannot maintain or obtain the required security clearances for our facilities and our employees, or obtain these clearances in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform certain U.S. government contracts. Further, loss of a facility clearance, or an employee’s failure to obtain or maintain a security clearance, could result in a U.S. government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew a contract. Lack of required clearances could also impede our ability to bid on or win new U.S. government contracts. This could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 24.0%, 25.0% and 23.9% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, declining trade relations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political, legal, social and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.27•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC.•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we conducted no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of export control laws or regulations to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (""DDTC""), DoC and OFAC. In addition, we have made various commitments to U.S. government agencies that oversee trade and export matters and have committed that we will maintain certain policies and procedures including maintaining a company-wide Chief Trade Compliance Officer and Office of Trade Compliance and conducting ongoing internal assessment and reporting any future violations to those agencies. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. export control laws or regulations, including trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. If it is determined that we have violated U.S. export control laws or regulations or trade regulations, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm.•We are subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We may be subject to future compliance audits that uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.28•We may be affected by the future imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions - The current U.S. administration has generally not amended the trade policies and tariffs on imported products from the prior administration, and has increased sanctions against Russia. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of U.S. and foreign trade policies, including, in connection with our business with customers outside of the United States or with newly sanctioned entities could adversely affect our business and financial results.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner. Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon which collectively accounted for 10.6% of our sales in fiscal 2023, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers is constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from such free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners or our competition can offer such technology to their subscribers or customers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Disputes with our subcontractors or key suppliers or their inability to deliver on a timely basis, could cause unanticipated delays in our shipments.Our subcontractors and key suppliers are essential members of our team. Nevertheless, we may occasionally have commercial disputes with them (e.g., over the quality, timeliness or cost of their products). Additionally, our subcontractors and suppliers may experience financial difficulties which may impact their ability to execute against their contractual commitments and delay or otherwise disrupt deliveries. In such instances, we may not receive the components or subsystems for which we have contracted. Taken together, each of the risks set forth herein may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.External events outside our control may disrupt our supply chain. With recent history in mind, natural disasters, pandemics, extreme weather conditions, legislative or regulatory changes may all impact the performance of our supplier base. Our subcontractors and suppliers may also, in turn, be unable to maintain the quality of the materials they receive from their respective suppliers.29Our reliance on a single partner to source critical parts (i.e., where we are unable to develop a critical redundant source of supply) may impair our ability to produce and deliver our products. This negative impact could be even greater where we are required to comply with sourcing requirements within our U.S. government contracts regarding the purchase of counterfeit or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. In some instances, where we rely on supplier certifications of compliance with these laws and regulations, an improper or incomplete certification may adversely impact our production capability.Strategic Growth RisksWe face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.Our business is uniquely subject to certain risks related to its long term growth. These risks include:•We may not be ultimately successful in implementing our ""One Comtech"" transformation and integration of individual businesses into two segments - The transformation of Comtech from stand-alone individual businesses toward a single “One Comtech” is a complex undertaking, requiring the consolidation of both manufacturing and back-office teams around the globe in parallel with a global re-branding effort. Managing the merger of multiple production facilities and their attending employee populations is difficult and may negatively impact business prospects in the short and long term. Similarly, our re-branding of the company as Comtech risks damaging goodwill accumulated over decades of operation as individual businesses.   •The loss of key technical and/or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical and management personnel. The management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. Filling new positions may be difficult in the current competitive labor market. Moreover, many of our key and technical management personnel would be difficult to replace and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters and some work out of their respective homes. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably, especially in the current competitive labor market.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational, production and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls, as well as our production capabilities. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.30•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During the past four years, partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased as well as freight costs. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.Loss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations and growth plans or harm our business.We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan or business continuity plan for one or more of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business an growth plans, including to our relationships with our customers and employees.We have incurred indebtedness under a Credit Facility, and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") with a syndicate of lenders.On November 30, 2022, we refinanced the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (also referred to herein as the “Credit Facility”) with the existing lenders. The Credit Facility provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $300.0 million consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility (“Revolving Loan Facility”) with a borrowing limit of $150.0 million, including a $20.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a swingline loan credit sublimit of $15.0 million; (ii) a $50.0 million term loan A (“Term Loan”); and (iii) an accordion feature allowing us to make a request to borrow up to an additional $100.0 million subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, including approval by our lenders.  As of July 31, 2023, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $164.4 million, of which $4.4 million and $160.0 million is reflected in the current and non-current portion of long-term debt, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of July 31, 2023, we also had $1.0 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.Currently, the Credit Facility has a maturity date of October 31, 2024 (“Maturity Date”), which is approximately one year out from now. In anticipation of the upcoming Maturity Date, we engaged a third-party financial advisor to assist us with both the refinancing of our existing Credit Facility, as well as with our evaluation of other capital structure-related alternatives. In tandem with these activities, which we believe are nearing closure, we are also in discussions with our existing lenders to amend and extend the Maturity Date of the Credit Facility, if needed to complete these important initiatives. However, we may not be successful in securing an amendment and extension of the Credit Facility or complete such refinancing activities by October 31, 2023, when the debt outstanding under our Credit Facility would become a short-term current liability. 31At the Maturity Date of the Credit Facility, as it currently stands or as may be extended, if we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are not able to obtain favorable terms pursuant to any such refinancing, the size of our Credit Facility could be reduced, more restrictive covenants could be imposed on our business and features of the existing Credit Facility could otherwise be altered or eliminated.Our Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person.We anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these covenants.Further, our ability to comply with covenants, terms of and conditions on our facility may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including but not limited to business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends (to the extent applicable) or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, restructuring our debt and other capital-intensive activities;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Moreover, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions or to fund other activities for general business purposes. If additional new debt is added to the current or planned debt levels, or if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings. In this regard, failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings, as well as our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. Any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and our credit ratings. 32The holders of our Series A Preferred Convertible Stock have a majority vote consent right over our ability to amend, restate, or replace the Credit Facility on terms that are materially different to those of the Credit Facility or that adversely affect our ability to fulfill its repurchase obligations of the Series A Preferred Convertible Stock. If we need to amend, restate or replace the Credit Facility on materially different terms or terms adverse to the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Convertible Stock, and we are unable to obtain the consent of such holders, we may be unable to obtain required financing or liquidity on favorable terms, or at all.Acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to evaluate other acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Such efforts may not result in an acquisition or ultimately be beneficial to us.Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of the acquired intangibles. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Foreign acquisitions and investments are regularly subject to scrutiny by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (“DCSA”) and our role as a U.S. federal contractor escalates such scrutiny, in particular, with respect to compliance with industrial security requirements. Failure to comply with the requirements of the U.S. government could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time of authority to operate under certain government programs or from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2023, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $347.7 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2023, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $225.9 million.33For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segments each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.On August 1, 2023 (the first day of our fiscal 2024), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 18.3% and 8.9%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment. It is possible that, during fiscal 2024 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could fluctuate.A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2024 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2024 (the start of our fiscal 2025). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2023. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.34Cybersecurity RisksWe could be negatively impacted by a system failure, lack of or failure of redundant system components, security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems. If any such events occur, we may have to reimburse our customers for damages that they may have incurred, pay contract penalties, or provide refunds. Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber-attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third-party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks (including ransomware) or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT networks and systems, as well as third-party data center facilities, have been and, we believe will continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to public safety agencies, wireless carriers as well as national security and other sensitive government functions. Many of our systems have, or are required to have, system redundancies and back-up; in some cases, we may not have sufficient redundancy and/or redundancy and/or back-ups may fail. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to system failures, failure of redundant system components, actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of public safety and location technologies (including 911 hosted systems), we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third-party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems. These types of information, IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. There can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption (including as a result of a lack of redundancy and/or failure of such redundancy) involving these types of information, IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functionality of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results and delay progress on other business objectives; •Require us to make payments to our customers to reimburse them for damages, pay them penalties or provide refunds; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.35The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third-party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In the event of such disclosure, we also may be subject to claims of breach of contract, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legal, Regulatory and Litigation RisksChanges in U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The laws, rules, and regulations dealing with U.S. federal, state and local and foreign income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have immediate and/or retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made to applicable tax laws and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.Our U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2020 through 2022 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2019 are subject to audit. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns were immaterial, a tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.36We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, cessation of operations or reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG-911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG-911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG-911 products and services are lower than for traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and/or more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.37•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 and emerging 988 businesses are dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced. On May 17, 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced $200.0 million in new funding for states, territories and tribes to build local 988 capacity. This follows an initial $432.0 million investment by the federal government in July 2022 to support the transition to 988 and build up crisis center capacity. Our ability to develop this aspect of our business is highly dependent on the deployment of this federal funding. If deployment of those funds is delayed, stopped or never occurs, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile communications industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Over the past several years, there have been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services, which could negatively impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.38•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. •Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Also, as further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Form 10-K, the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. We must comply with these new rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with new accounting standards, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to them, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex rules.39Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on Nasdaq. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with us for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, we will negotiate with these customers in good faith because we believe our technology does not infringe the cited patents or due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount we may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.Our assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in a future period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, employee claims, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses.Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim, including any out of pocket payments we are required to make and the costs of the defense against such claim, could result in material costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    For additional information related to these lawsuits, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (12)(a) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Form 10-K.40Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. We cannot guarantee that our issued and acquired patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may impact some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved, and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that may include payment of a reasonable royalty, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.41From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Competitive RisksAll of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services or future industry standards embodying new technologies, such as multi-frequency time division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized as a result.Our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a one-time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one-time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.42Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements more quickly than our competitors that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices of (or not charge any price for) competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment provides public safety and location technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives, or our distributors may not be successful. We also began an evaluation and repositioning of certain of our location technology solutions within our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment in order to focus on providing higher-margin solution offerings and increase our penetration into the public safety space. To date, we have ceased offering certain location technology solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.We rely on various third-party companies and their technology in our business. Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third-party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third-party data and content increases substantially.43•Third-party data centers or third-party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and location technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which are hosted at third-party data centers, and on the networks, as well as within the data centers of our wireless carrier partners. Our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers, customer data centers, and cloud providers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors.Our products including software may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures by us and our competitors;•our ability to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions;•our issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•our issuance of debt;•our ability to successfully access equity and debt capital markets;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•shareholder activism involving our common stock, board of directors or corporate governance;44•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations and new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the terrestrial and wireless networks and satellite and space communications markets;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in prevailing interest rates;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation;•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices; and•potential resurgences of the COVID-19 or similar pandemics.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In addition to potential issuances of our shares of common stock associated with acquisitions, in the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Actions of activist stockholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or share price. Our Board of Directors and management team value constructive input from investors, regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders, and are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders; however, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to actions, campaigns, or proposals that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with certain stockholders will be successful in preventing the occurrence of stockholder activist campaigns.Campaigns by activist stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies often demand that companies undertake or pursue financial restructuring, increase debt, issue special dividends, repurchase shares, or undertake sales of assets or other transactions, including strategic transactions. Campaigns may also be initiated by activist stockholders advocating for particular environmental or social causes. Activist stockholders who disagree with the composition of a company’s board of directors, or with its strategy and/or management often seek to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of a company through various activities. As discussed elsewhere in this report, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to activities and campaigns initiated by activist stockholders.Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management team and employees from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. Further, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder campaigns or initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain investors, customers, employees, and other business partners. Also, we could be required to incur significant expenses related to any activist stockholder matters (included but not limited to legal fees, fees for financial 45advisors, fees for public relation advisors and proxy solicitation expenses). As a result, activist stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price in ways that can be difficult to predict or foresee.Even if we are successful in any proxy contest or in defending against any unsolicited takeover attempt, our business could be adversely affected by any such proxy contest or unsolicited takeover attempt due to:•perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, customers, suppliers, and other business partners; and•if individuals are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda or who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our Board of Directors to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders, and/or adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We cannot predict, and no guarantees can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing actions by stockholders and our responses thereto or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Any of these matters or any further actions by stockholders and our responses thereto may impact and result in volatility or stagnation of our share price.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or divestiture involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we currently have a classified board and the employment contract with our CEO and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech"
8,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2022-09-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Summary of Risk Factors

We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic, supply chain constraints and related effects will adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.The COVID-19 pandemic and related disease control measures have significantly impacted the global economy and has created significant supply chain constraints. These issues have had and could continue to have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although there has been an increase in vaccinations throughout the United States, vaccinations internationally have progressed at a slower rate and the impact of new strains of the virus are uncertain. The situation is changing rapidly and there may be additional impacts of which we are currently unaware. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted.Poor business conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. Because the timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict and remain ongoing, there is a risk that such conditions will have an adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations, in particular in light of ongoing global supply chain disruptions, part shortages and extended lead times for components. The impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include:•disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services, including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels;•temporary closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers;•permanent closures of our direct and indirect suppliers, resulting in adverse effects to our supply chain;•temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing, production and assembly facilities due to stay at home orders in many markets and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries;•increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business and workforce;•supply chain disruptions, including increased freight costs;•delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments;•cancellations in our backlog;•reductions in short- and long-term demand for our products, or other disruptions in technology buying patterns;20•adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world, potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending, which may adversely affect our results of operations and cause difficulty in managing inventory levels;•delays to and/or lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity;•challenges for us, our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets;•workforce disruptions due to illness, quarantines, governmental actions, other restrictions, and/or the social distancing measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 at certain of our locations around the world in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and of the communities in which we operate (including potential returns to restricting the number of employees attending events or meetings in person, limiting the number of people in our buildings and factories at any one time, restricting access to our facilities, suspending employee travel and meeting in person with customers);•increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely; and •our management team continuing to commit significant time, attention and resources to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce.The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 and supply chain constraints on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. These impacts, individually or in the aggregate, have had and could continue to have adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic, the measures taken in response to it, and their effects, persist for an extended period of time, or if there are periodic resurgences of COVID-19. New and ongoing challenges relating to current supply chain constraints and impacts from inflation, including for satellite ground station and troposcatter components, could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and financial results.The global supply chain for certain raw materials and components, including those used in our satellite ground station and troposcatter equipment, has experienced significant strain in recent periods. The constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and could further affect, availability and lead times of raw materials and components, thereby impeding our ability to meet customer demand in circumstances where we cannot timely secure supply of components that meet our quality standards. Even when raw materials and components are available, they often come with higher prices reflecting an imbalance between supply and demand, as well as inflationary pressures affecting global markets.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, labor challenges and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have caused, and we expect will continue to cause further delays in the supply chain. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, constrained supply conditions have and are expected to continue to adversely impact our costs of goods sold and may impact the timing and amount of revenue we realize. During fiscal 2022, we experienced disruptions in our supply chain relating to later-than-expected delivery of certain key components from several suppliers that adversely impacted our revenue in fiscal 2022. In addition, the ongoing supply chain issues have affected the quality of the components we receive. Certain parts received in fiscal 2022 did not meet our quality specifications and we were unable to use them. We obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources. Some of our single source suppliers, particularly those that provide satellite ground station and troposcatter components, have reported to us that they are having disruptions in their respective supply chains. These single source components, which includes items such as cooling fans and power supplies, are in limited supply. In some cases, we have now depleted our stock inventory and we are on waiting lists to obtain additional components. In order to ship certain items during fiscal 2023, we must obtain additional components to produce certain finished goods. We continue to seek new suppliers and inventory elsewhere. In light of current challenges in the supply chain, we may not be able to qualify alternate suppliers for our components. 21Heading into our fiscal 2023, we have a significant portion of our targeted revenues in our backlog. However, if shipments from our backlog are delayed or we are unable to obtain expected orders or components, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. These aforementioned supply chain constraints, and their related challenges could result in future shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and financial results. There can be no assurance that the impacts of all the aforementioned conditions will not continue, or worsen, in the future.Our business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Historically, our business outlook is difficult to forecast and backlog (sometimes referred to herein as orders or bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; start-up costs associated with the opening of our two new high-volume technology manufacturing centers; price competition; new product introductions by us or our competitors; customer bankruptcies; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance and impact of acquisitions; new accounting standards; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); general global economic conditions, and the impact of natural disasters or global pandemics.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic conditions (or a worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic as described above) could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite ground station technologies, amplifier products and mission-critical technologies that generally have short order and lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our public safety and location technologies are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions or to perform such solutions internally. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.In addition, a large portion of our consolidated net sales are derived in part from large U.S. federal and state government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict.If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have an adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.Many of the end-markets for our products and services may be significantly impacted for other issues that result in adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are in emerging and developing countries that are subject to sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their spending. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and have significantly impaired the ability of certain of our government customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from many emerging and developing countries and any such reduced purchasing power of our customers could adversely impact our sales and backlog. In addition, many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank or government financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and will continue to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of financing conditions may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment and could cause their projects to be postponed or canceled. In addition, if an adverse economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable and/or inventories which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.22The United Kingdom (""U.K."") exited from the European Union (""E.U."") on January 31, 2020. Such exit, commonly referred to as ""Brexit,"" has created and may continue to create economic and political uncertainties and impacts that could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. Although the U.K. and E.U. entered a trade agreement for goods that was approved by the European Parliament in April 2021, there is no guarantee that it will remain in force as other cross-border issues remain contested. We maintain production, engineering and sales facilities in the U.K. and adverse consequences of Brexit could result in a deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political and regulatory uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.We believe that the current global economic business environment is unstable and sudden negative changes could result in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. The timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are difficult to predict. If U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways. In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, Maryland, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, terrorist attack, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. Any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. We currently, and intend to continue to, operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona. The COVID-19 pandemic, a terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To support our long-term business goals for our satellite earth station product line, in fiscal 2021, we commenced a 15-year lease for a new 146,000 square foot facility in Chandler, Arizona and began shifting production of our satellite earth station products from our existing Tempe, Arizona locations. If we are unable to have a smooth transition to our new facility, production and deliveries of our products may be impacted and we may incur unexpected costs. We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment activities are conducted in Washington State near a fault line. We maintain operations in Maryland near a U.S. Navy facility which may be more prone to a terrorist attack. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona and our antenna production facility in the United Kingdom), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.23We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and business shutdowns both domestically and globally, including in locations in which we have significant operations. These or any further political, governmental or other actions to contain the spread or treat the impact of COVID-19, and the resulting developments, are highly uncertain and unpredictable and could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have an adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows. The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response to it could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes, export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cyber-attacks as a result of the conflict.The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted our sales pipeline and continues to have significant repercussions for our business. Although sales into Russia represented approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, consolidated net sales into Russia in fiscal 2023 and beyond were expected to significantly grow. As a result of the economic sanctions against Russia, we are assuming no new sales in Russia in fiscal 2023 and the foreseeable future. As a result of this conflict, in fiscal 2022, certain customers (including the U.S. and Ukrainian government) paused procurement and deployment of satellite and troposcatter communication systems, and instead began purchasing war-fighting equipment.For example, we had several opportunities to provide wireless communication systems (including troposcatter systems) to Ukraine for a variety of both defense and communications uses. Funding for these systems was expected to be provided by Ukraine and by the U.S. government and these items were expected to be awarded and shipped in the second half of fiscal 2022. As result of the conflict in Ukraine, it has become difficult to predict the timing or dollar amount of these types of awards. Additionally, funding for opportunities with other customers that we expected to book and ship has also been shifted to other programs and/or temporarily delayed as a result of changes in defense spending priorities. Prior to this conflict, we maintained a small group of employees in Moscow, Russia who supported certain UHP-branded satellite communications products. We are actively hiring new employees, expanding our Canadian operations and shifting certain commercial software development and support activities outside of Russia. However, as we are currently in an environment where software engineering talent is already in high demand and commands a premium, we expect to incur additional annual expenses in connection with this personnel shift for our UHP products. We may not be able to timely ramp up our operations in Canada or elsewhere on a sufficient scale to support anticipated growth of our UHP products, which could adversely impact future revenues, gross margins and operations.Business RisksOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellations could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. 24In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. Also, a significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with public safety and location technology solutions. Funding of these contracts is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, particularly during periods of economic instability. Nor can there be any assurance that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change; a customer may not follow up with order details (e.g., delivery instructions), fluctuations in currency exchange rates after an order is placed could cause our products to become too expensive for a foreign customer; a customer’s program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early due to changes in a customer’s priorities; funding may not be included in future budgets; actual indirect rates being reimbursed on U.S. government contracts may ultimately be less than those indirect rates included in our initial proposals; or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under firm fixed-price contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin could be materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $132.6 million, $201.1 million and $223.4 million or 27.2%, 34.6% and 36.2% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2023 and beyond depends, in part, on significant new orders from the U.S. government, which undergoes extreme budgetary pressures from time to time.25We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these discussions could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved (such as the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan or other parts of the world), or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that a shutdown of the U.S. government may occur, or interim budgets may be adopted. As such, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and adverse impacts on our results of operations. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. Moreover, an outbreak of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantines, closures and travel restrictions may cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and distribution systems. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, accelerations, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. 26•Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - Our U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.•Our employees may not be able to obtain and maintain the required security clearances for the facilities in which we perform sensitive government work - Certain of our U.S. government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances. If we cannot maintain or obtain the required security clearances for our facilities and our employees, or obtain these clearances in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform certain U.S. government contracts. Further, loss of a facility clearance, or an employee’s failure to obtain or maintain a security clearance, could result in a U.S. government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew a contract. Lack of required clearances could also impede our ability to bid on or win new U.S. government contracts. This could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. TCS underwent audits by the DCAA for periods prior to Comtech’s fiscal 2016 acquisition of TCS. The DCAA has informed us that it is proposing retroactive contracts adjustments that, if finalized and issued, would result in the need for us to provide a refund to the U.S. government of approximately $2.4 million. We disagree with the DCAA’s assessment and would vigorously protest any adjustment, but ultimately an adjustment may be issued. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.27Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 25.0%, 23.9% and 23.5% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC.•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we conducted no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. 28•We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of export control laws or regulations to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (""DDTC""), DoC and OFAC. In addition, we have made various commitments to U.S. government agencies that oversee trade and export matters and have committed that we will maintain certain policies and procedures including maintaining a company-wide Chief Trade Compliance Officer and Office of Trade Compliance and conducting ongoing internal assessment and reporting any future violations to those agencies. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. export control laws or regulations, including trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. If it is determined that we have violated U.S. export control laws or regulations or trade regulations, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm.•We are subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We may be subject to future compliance audits that uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may be affected by the future imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions - The current U.S. administration has generally not amended the trade policies and tariffs on imported products from the prior administration, and has increased sanctions against Russia. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of U.S. and foreign trade policies, including, in connection with our business with customers outside of the United States or with newly sanctioned entities could adversely affect our business and financial results.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner. Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon which collectively accounted for 11.1% of our sales in fiscal 2022, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers is constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from such free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners or our competition can offer such technology to their subscribers or customers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.29Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Strategic Growth RisksWe face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.Our business is uniquely subject to certain risks related to its long term growth. These risks include:•The loss of key technical and/or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical and management personnel. The management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. Filling new positions may be difficult in the current competitive labor market. Moreover, many of our key and technical management personnel would be difficult to replace and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters and some work out of their respective homes. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably, especially in the current competitive labor market.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational, production and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls, as well as our production capabilities. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. Our planned moves to new high volume manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona may be delayed and subject to unforeseen costs (both capital and operational), which could impede our ability to complete customer orders and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.30•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During the past three years, partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased as well as freight costs. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.Loss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations and growth plans or harm our business.We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan or business continuity plan for one or more of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business an growth plans, including to our relationships with our customers and employees.We have incurred indebtedness under a Credit Facility, and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") with a syndicate of lenders, replacing our prior Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2016. The Credit Facility provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $550.0 million consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility with a borrowing limit of $300.0 million; (ii) an accordion feature allowing us to borrow up to an additional $250.0 million; (iii) a $35.0 million letter of credit sublimit; and (iv) a swingline loan credit sublimit of $25.0 million. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. As of July 31, 2022, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $130.0 million, which is reflected in the non-current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of July 31, 2022, we also had $0.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.The Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2023. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person.We anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these covenants.31Further, our ability to comply with covenants, terms of and conditions our facility may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including but not limited to business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, restructuring our debt and other capital-intensive activities;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Moreover, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions or to fund other activities for general business purposes. If additional new debt is added to the current or planned debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings. In this regard, failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings, as well as our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. Any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and our credit ratings. The holders of our Series A Preferred Convertible Stock have a majority vote consent right over our ability to amend, restate, or replace the Credit Agreement on terms that are materially different to those of the Credit Agreement or that adversely affect the Company’s ability to fulfill its repurchase obligations of the Series A Preferred Convertible Stock. If we need to amend, restate or replace the Credit Agreement on materially different terms or terms adverse to the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Convertible Stock, and we are unable to obtain the consent of such holders, we may be unable to obtain required financing or liquidity on favorable terms, or at all.Acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to evaluate other acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Such efforts may not result in an acquisition or ultimately be beneficial to us.Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of the acquired intangibles. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and32•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Foreign acquisitions and investments are regularly subject to scrutiny by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (“DCSA”) and our role as a U.S. federal contractor escalates such scrutiny, in particular, with respect to compliance with industrial security requirements. Failure to comply with the requirements of the U.S. government could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time of authority to operate under certain government programs or from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2022, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $347.7 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2022, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $247.3 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segments each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.As a result of our segment restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 from the Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segments to the Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segments, we performed an interim, quantitative assessment as of July 29, 2022 and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units, both before and after the change, using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluations, we determined that our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 18.4% and 11.6%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment. Given its proximity to our next regularly scheduled annual goodwill impairment testing date, we utilized our July 29, 2022 interim, quantitative assessment to conclude that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment as of August 1, 2022.33It is possible that, during fiscal 2023 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could fluctuate. Such fluctuation could be caused by uncertainty about the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on global business activity.A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2023 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Satellite and Space Communications and Terrestrial and Wireless Networks reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2023 (the start of our fiscal 2024). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2022. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.Cybersecurity RisksWe could be negatively impacted by a system failure, lack of or failure of redundant system components, security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems. If any such events occur, we may have to reimburse our customers for damages that they may have incurred, pay contract penalties, or provide refunds. Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber-attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third-party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks (including ransomware) or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT networks and systems, as well as third-party data center facilities, have been and, we believe will continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to public safety agencies, wireless carriers as well as national security and other sensitive government functions. Many of our systems have, or are required to have, system redundancies and back-up; in some cases, we may not have sufficient redundancy and/or redundancy and/or back-ups may fail. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to system failures, failure of redundant system components, actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of public safety and location technologies (including 911 hosted systems), we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third-party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems. These types of information, IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. There can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.34A security breach or other significant disruption (including as a result of a lack of redundancy and/or failure of such redundancy) involving these types of information, IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functionality of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results; •Require us to make payments to our customers to reimburse them for damages, pay them penalties or provide refunds; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third-party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In the event of such disclosure, we also may be subject to claims of breach of contract, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.35Legal, Regulatory and Litigation RisksChanges in U.S. federal, state and foreign tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The laws, rules, and regulations dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have immediate and/or retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made to applicable tax laws and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2019 through 2021 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2018 are subject to audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state excise tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns were immaterial, a tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, cessation of operations or reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.36•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG-911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG-911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG-911 products and services are lower than for traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and/or more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile communications industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.37Over the past several years, there have been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services, which could negatively impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. 38•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Also, as further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Form 10-K, the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. We must comply with these new rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with new accounting standards, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to them, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex rules.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on Nasdaq. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with us for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, we will negotiate with these customers in good faith because we believe our technology does not infringe the cited patents or due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount we may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.Our assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in a future period.39We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, employee claims, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses.Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim, including any out of pocket payments we are required to make and the costs of the defense against such claim, could result in material costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    For additional information related to these lawsuits, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (12)(a) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Form 10-K.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. We cannot guarantee that our issued and acquired patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.40Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may impact some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved, and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Competitive RisksAll of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services or future industry standards embodying new technologies, such as multi-frequency time division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.41New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized as a result.Our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a one-time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one-time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements more quickly than our competitors that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices of (or not charge any price for) competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment provides public safety and location technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives, or our distributors may not be successful. We also began an evaluation and repositioning of certain of our location technology solutions within our Terrestrial and Wireless Networks segment in order to focus on providing higher-margin solution offerings and increase our penetration into the public safety space. To date, we have ceased offering certain location technology solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.42We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.We rely on various third-party companies and their technology in our business. Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third-party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third-party data and content increases substantially.•Third-party data centers or third-party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and location technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which are hosted at third-party data centers, and on the networks, as well as within the data centers of our wireless carrier partners. Our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers, customer data centers, and cloud providers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors.43Our products including software may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures by us and our competitors;•our ability to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions;•our issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•our issuance of debt;•our ability to successfully access equity and debt capital markets;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•shareholder activism involving our common stock, board of directors or corporate governance;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations and new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the terrestrial and wireless networks and satellite and space communications markets;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in prevailing interest rates;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation;•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices; and•the ongoing and future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In addition to potential issuances of our shares of common stock associated with acquisitions, in the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.44Actions of activist stockholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or share price. Our Board of Directors and management team value constructive input from investors, regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders, and are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders; however, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to actions, campaigns, or proposals that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with certain stockholders will be successful in preventing the occurrence of stockholder activist campaigns.Campaigns by activist stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies often demand that companies undertake or pursue financial restructuring, increase debt, issue special dividends, repurchase shares, or undertake sales of assets or other transactions, including strategic transactions. Campaigns may also be initiated by activist stockholders advocating for particular environmental or social causes. Activist stockholders who disagree with the composition of a company’s board of directors, or with its strategy and/or management often seek to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of a company through various activities. As discussed elsewhere in this report, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to activities and campaigns initiated by activist stockholders.Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management team and employees from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. Further, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder campaigns or initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain investors, customers, employees, and other business partners. Also, we could be required to incur significant expenses related to any activist stockholder matters (included but not limited to legal fees, fees for financial advisors, fees for public relation advisors and proxy solicitation expenses). As a result, activist stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price in ways that can be difficult to predict or foresee.Even if we are successful in any proxy contest or in defending against any unsolicited takeover attempt, our business could be adversely affected by any such proxy contest or unsolicited takeover attempt due to:•perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, customers, suppliers, and other business partners;•if individuals are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda or who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our Board of Directors to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders, and/or adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We cannot predict, and no guarantees can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing actions by stockholders and our responses thereto or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Any of these matters or any further actions by stockholders and our responses thereto may impact and result in volatility or stagnation of our share price.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or divestiture involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we currently have a classified board and the employment contract with our CEO and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.45In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our Common Stock dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly common stock dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends with respect to our Common Stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Credit Facility. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future Common Stock dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility, as well as Board approval and certain voting rights of holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay common stock dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Credit Facility, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
11,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2021-10-04,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Summary of Risk Factors
 The following is a summary of the principal risks that could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial conditions, or operating results. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below: Global Risks•We are unable to predict the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain constraints will continue to adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.•Our fiscal 2022 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.•If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.•We have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack or other significant disruptions (including natural disasters).Business Risks•Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification.•Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.•Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers.•Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.•Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.•A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.•If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers could have a material adversely affect. 17Strategic Growth Risks•We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business.•We must service the debt and maintain compliance with various covenants under a Credit Facility that imposes restrictions on our business.•Acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock. •Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.Cybersecurity Risks•We could be negatively impacted by a system failure, breach, attack or intrusion of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems.•The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached.Legal, Regulatory and Litigation Risks•Changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •We may be subject to environmental liabilities.•The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.•Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.•Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.•Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.•We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims.•Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.•Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Competitive Risks•All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position.•Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.•We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers.•Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.        18Risks Related to our Common Stock•Our stock price is volatile.•Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.•Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.•A disruption in our Common Stock dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.Global RisksThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain constraints have impacted our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic, supply chain constraints and related effects will adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.The COVID-19 pandemic and related disease control measures have significantly impacted the global economy and has created significant supply chain constraints. These issues have had and could continue to have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although there has been an increase in vaccinations throughout the United States, vaccinations internationally have progressed at a slower rate and the impact of new strains of the virus are uncertain. The situation is changing rapidly and there may be additional impacts of which we are currently unaware. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted.Poor business conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. Because the timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict and remain ongoing, there is a risk that such conditions will have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations. The impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include:•disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services, including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels;•temporary closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers;•permanent closures of our direct and indirect suppliers, resulting in adverse effects to our supply chain;•temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing, production and assembly facilities due to stay at home orders and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries;•increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic;•supply chain disruptions, including increased freight costs;•delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments;•cancellations in our backlog;•reductions in short- and long-term demand for our products, or other disruptions in technology buying patterns;•adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world, potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending, which may result in decreased net revenue, gross margins, or earnings and/or in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels;19•delays to and/or lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity;•challenges for us, our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets;•workforce disruptions due to illness, quarantines, governmental actions, other restrictions, and/or the social distancing measures we have taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 at certain of our locations around the world in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and of the communities in which we operate (including working from home, restricting the number of employees attending events or meetings in person, limiting the number of people in our buildings and factories at any one time, further restricting access to our facilities, suspending employee travel and inability to meet in person with customers);•increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely; and •our management team continuing to commit significant time, attention and resources to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce.The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 and supply chain constraints on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. These impacts, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic and the measures taken in response to it, and their effects, persist for an extended period of time, or if there are periodic resurgences of the outbreak. Under any of these circumstances, the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or hampered by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our operations, direct and indirect suppliers, partners, and customers.Our fiscal 2022 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Historically, our business outlook is difficult to forecast and backlog (sometimes referred to herein as orders or bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; start-up costs associated with the opening of our two new high-volume technology manufacturing centers; price competition; new product introductions by us or our competitors; customer bankruptcies; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance and impact of acquisitions; new accounting standards; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); general global economic conditions, and the impact of natural disasters or global pandemics.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic conditions (or a worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic as described above) could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite ground station technologies, amplifier products and mission-critical technologies that generally have short order and lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our public safety and location technologies are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions or to perform such solutions internally. As a result of any such conditions or changes, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.In addition, a large portion of our Government Solutions segment's net sales are derived in part from large U.S. government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict.20If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.In addition to the unique business risks related to COVID-19, many of the end-markets for our products and services may be significantly impacted for other issues that result in adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are in emerging and developing countries that are subject to sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their spending. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and significantly impaired the ability of certain of our government customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from many emerging and developing countries. We believe that the current global economic business environment is unstable and sudden negative changes could result in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. The timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict.In addition, many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of financing conditions may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.The United Kingdom (""U.K."") exited from the European Union (""E.U."") on January 31, 2020. Such exit, commonly referred to as ""Brexit,"" has created and may continue to create economic and political uncertainties and impacts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. Although the U.K. and E.U. entered a trade agreement for goods that was approved by the European Parliament in April 2021, there is no guarantee that it will remain in force as other cross-border issues remain contested. We maintain production, engineering and sales facilities in the U.K. and adverse consequences concerning Brexit could result in a deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.In the past, our overall business has not been immune from adverse economic conditions. If U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate further, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations during periods of adverse conditions as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of such conditions or the impact it could have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, or if we are unable to secure certain parts that are currently in limited supply due to supplier constraints, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network buildouts from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.21We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, Maryland, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. Although many of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. We currently, and intend to continue to, operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona. The COVID-19 pandemic, a terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. To support our long-term business goals for our satellite earth station product line, in fiscal 2021, we commenced a 15-year lease for a new 146,000 square foot facility in Chandler, Arizona and began shifting production of our satellite earth station products from our existing Tempe, Arizona locations. If we are unable to have a smooth transition to our new facility, production and deliveries of our products may be impacted and we may incur unexpected costs. We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line. We maintain operations in Maryland near a U.S. Navy facility which is more prone to a terrorist attack. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our antenna production facility in the United Kingdom), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and business shutdowns both domestically and globally, including in locations in which we have significant operations. These or any further political, governmental or other actions to contain the spread or treat the impact of COVID-19, and the resulting developments, are highly uncertain and unpredictable and could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows. 22Business RisksOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellations could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. Also, a significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with public safety and location technology solutions. Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, particularly during periods of macroeconomic instability. Nor can there be any assurance that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, a customer may not follow up with order details (e.g., delivery instructions), fluctuations in currency exchange rates after an order is placed could cause our products to become too expensive for a foreign customer, a customer’s program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early due to changes in a customer’s priorities, funding may not be included in future budgets, actual indirect rates being reimbursed on U.S. government contracts may ultimately be less than those indirect rates included in our initial proposals, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under firm fixed-price contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.23Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $201.1 million, $223.4 million and $269.2 million or 34.6%, 36.2% and 40.1% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2022 and beyond depends, in part, on significant new orders from the U.S. government, which undergoes extreme budgetary pressures from time to time.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these discussions could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved (such as the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan or other parts of the world), or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. As such, it is possible that a shutdown of the U.S. government may occur, or interim budgets may be adopted. As such, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. Moreover, an outbreak of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantines, closures and travel restrictions may cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and distribution systems. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, accelerations, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.24Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. •Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - Our U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.•Our employees may not be able to obtain and maintain the required security clearances for the facilities in which we perform sensitive government work - Certain of our U.S. Government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances. If we cannot maintain or obtain the required security clearances for our facilities and our employees, or obtain these clearances in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform certain U.S. Government contracts. Further, loss of a facility clearance, or an employee’s failure to obtain or maintain a security clearance, could result in a U.S. Government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew a contract. Lack of required clearances could also impede our ability to bid on or win new U.S. Government contracts. This could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. TCS underwent audits by the DCAA for periods prior to Comtech’s fiscal 2016 acquisition of TCS. The DCAA has informed us that it is proposing retroactive contracts adjustments that, if finalized and issued, would result in the need for us to provide a refund to the U.S. government of approximately $2.4 million. We disagree with the DCAA’s assessment and would vigorously protest any adjustment. We have not recorded any reserve related to these audits but ultimately an adjustment may be issued. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.25Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 23.9%, 23.5% and 25.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We price most of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes in certain cases. If the U.S. dollar strengthens from current levels against many international currencies, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC.26•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we conducted no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of export control laws or regulations to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (""DDTC""), DoC and OFAC. In addition, we have made various commitments to U.S. government agencies that oversee trade and export matters and have committed that we will maintain certain policies and procedures including maintaining a company-wide Chief Trade Compliance Officer and Office of Trade Compliance and conducting ongoing internal assessment and reporting any future violations to those agencies. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. export control laws or regulations, including trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. If it is determined that we have violated U.S. export control laws or regulations or trade regulations, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm.•We are subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We may be subject to future compliance audits that uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may be affected by the future imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions - The current U.S. administration has generally not amended the trade policies and tariffs on imported products from the prior administration, and increased sanctions against Russia. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of U.S. and foreign trade policies, including, in connection with our business with customers outside of the United States or with newly sanctioned entities could adversely affect our business and financial results.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner. Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon which accounted for 10.7% of our sales in fiscal 2021, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers is constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.27Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from such free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners or our competition can offer such technology to their subscribers or customers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers, such as Verizon which accounted for 10.7% of our revenues in fiscal 2021. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as Verizon, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Strategic Growth RisksWe face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical and/or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical and management personnel. Many of our key and technical management personnel would be difficult to replace and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters and some work out of their respective homes. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to-date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational, production and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls, as well as our production capabilities. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. Our planned moves to new high volume manufacturing facilities in Chandler, Arizona and Basingstoke, U.K. may be delayed and subject to unforeseen costs (both capital and operational), which could impede our ability to complete customer orders and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.28•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During the past two years or so, partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased as well as freight costs. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.We have incurred indebtedness under a Credit Facility, and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") with a syndicate of lenders, replacing our prior Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2016. The Credit Facility provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $550.0 million consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility with a borrowing limit of $300.0 million; (ii) an accordion feature allowing us to borrow up to an additional $250.0 million; (iii) a $35.0 million letter of credit sublimit; and (iv) a swingline loan credit sublimit of $25.0 million. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. As of July 31, 2021, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $201.0 million, which is reflected in the non-current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of July 31, 2021, we also had $1.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.The Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2023. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person.29As of July 31, 2021, our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) was 2.53x trailing twelve month (""TTM"") Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.75x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. Our Interest Expense Coverage Ratio as of July 31, 2021 was 13.05x TTM Adjusted EBITDA compared to the Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 3.25x TTM Adjusted EBITDA.We anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these covenants.Further, our ability to comply with covenants, terms of and conditions our facility may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Moreover, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions or to fund other activities for general business purposes. If additional new debt is added to the current or planned debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings. In this regard, failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings, as well as our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. Any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and our credit ratings. Acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to evaluate other acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Such efforts may not result in an acquisition or ultimately be beneficial to us.Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of the acquired intangibles. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and30•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Foreign acquisitions and investments are regularly subject to scrutiny by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (“DCSA”) and our role as a U.S. federal contractor escalates such scrutiny, in particular, with respect to compliance with industrial security requirements. Failure to comply with the requirements of the U.S. government could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time of authority to operate under certain government programs or from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisition of CGC Technology Limited (""CGC"") and our fiscal 2021 acquisition of UHP Networks, Inc. (“UHP”), we now have a facility in Basingstoke, U.K. and opened a new office in Moscow, Russia. We have implemented and submitted for review by DCSA new stringent policies, protocols, procedures and organizational resolutions, including an updated Technology Control Plan, that prescribe the access controls and protective security measures necessary to preclude unauthorized access by foreign-national customers, vendors, visitors, or employees to classified information and unclassified export-controlled information. We have limited experience operating in these foreign jurisdictions and if we are unable to comply with local laws or U.S. laws related to such activity in foreign jurisdictions, or the DCSA or other U.S. government agencies directs us to implement changes, our operations could be restricted and/or we could be subject to fines and penalties, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2021, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $347.7 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2021, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $268.7 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segment each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.31On August 1, 2021 (the first day of our fiscal 2022), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 22.7% and 94.1%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.It is possible that, during fiscal 2022 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could fluctuate. Such fluctuation could be caused by uncertainty about the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on global business activity.A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2022 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2022 (the start of our fiscal 2023). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2021. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.Cybersecurity RisksWe could be negatively impacted by a system failure, lack of or failure of redundant system components, security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems. If such occurs, in some cases, we may have to reimburse our customers for damages that they may have incurred, pay contract penalties, or provide refunds. Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber-attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third-party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT networks and systems, as well as third-party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to public safety agencies, wireless carriers as well as national security and other sensitive government functions. Many of our systems have, or are required to have, system redundancies and back-up; in some cases, we may not have sufficient redundancy and/or redundancy and/or back-ups may fail. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to system failures, failure of redundant system components, actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.32As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of public safety and location technologies (including 911 hosted systems), we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third-party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems. These types of information, IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information, IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, and disruptions have occurred and will occur again in the future. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption (including as a result of a lack of redundancy and/or failure of such redundancy) involving these types of information, IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functionality of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results; •Make payments to our customers to reimburse them for damages, pay them penalties or provide refunds; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.33The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third-party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In the event of such disclosure, we also may be subject to claims of breach of contract, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legal, Regulatory and Litigation RisksChanges in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The laws, rules, and regulations dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have immediate and/or retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made to applicable tax laws and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2018 through 2020 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2017 are subject to audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state excise tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.34We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG-911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG-911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG-911 products and services are lower than for traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and/or more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.35•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile communications industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Over the past several years, there have been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.36Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. •Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Also, the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. As further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we note the following:•We must maintain compliance with new complex revenue recognition rules - On August 1, 2018 (our first quarter of fiscal 2019), we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry specific requirements, and provides a single revenue recognition model for contracts with customers. The ASU applies to all open contracts existing as of August 1, 2018. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method and there was no material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •We must maintain compliance with new complex lease accounting rules - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" to revise existing lease accounting guidance. The update requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use asset. We adopted Topic 842 on August 1, 2019, the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020. Except for recording a total right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which amount approximates 4.0% of our total consolidated assets at July 31, 2019, our adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact to our statements of operations or cash flows. 37We must comply with these new rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these new accounting standards, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to them, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex rules.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with us for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, we will negotiate with these customers in good faith because we believe our technology does not infringe the cited patents or due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount we may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.Our assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in a future period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, employee claims, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses.Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    For additional information related to these lawsuits, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (12)(a) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.38Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may impact some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.39From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved, and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Competitive RisksAll of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services or future industry standards embodying new technologies, such as multi-frequency time division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized.40Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a one-time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one-time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides public safety and location technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives, or our distributors may not be successful. We also began an evaluation and repositioning of certain of our location technology solutions within our Commercial Solutions segment in order to focus on providing higher margin solution offerings and increase our penetration into the public safety space. To date, we have ceased offering certain location technology solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.41We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third-party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third-party data and content increases substantially.•Third-party data centers or third-party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and location technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which are hosted at third-party data centers, and on the networks, as well as within the data centers of our wireless carrier partners. The third-party facilities are in Irvine, California, San Francisco, California, Dallas, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina, and we may use others as required. We also use third-party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. Additionally, certain non-911 products, technologies, and solutions are currently hosted in cloud-based applications operated by third parties such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers, customer data centers, and cloud providers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.42Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors.Our products including software may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•our ability to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In addition to potential issuances of our shares of common stock associated with acquisitions, in the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.43Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or divestiture involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we currently have a classified board and the employment contract with our CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our Common Stock dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly common stock dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends with respect to our Common Stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Credit Facility. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future Common Stock dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility, as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay common stock dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Credit Facility, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
10,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2020-09-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Risks Related to our BusinessDespite our belief that Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (""Gilat"") suffered a material adverse effect and that we are not obligated to close on our pending acquisition of Gilat, we may be required to complete such acquisition. If such event occurs, the merger with Gilat may not be successful, as we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the merger, the merger may divert our resources and management attention causing our operating results to fall short of expectations and we would incur substantial indebtedness which we may not be able to service in the future.On January 29, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Gilat Satellite Networks, Ltd. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Comtech would acquire Gilat by way of a merger of Comtech's newly formed subsidiary with and into Gilat, with Gilat surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech. Gilat is a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, with market leading positions in the satellite ground station and in-flight connectivity solutions markets and deep expertise in operating large network infrastructures. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Gilat ordinary share would be converted into the right to receive consideration of (i) $7.18 in cash, without interest, plus (ii) 0.08425 of a share of Comtech common stock (worth approximately $1.12 per Gilat ordinary share as of September 24, 2020), with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares. Based on the terms agreed to on January 29, 2020 and the September 24, 2020 closing price of Comtech common stock of $13.32 per share, the total amount payable to Gilat shareholders would have been approximately $465.8 million (consisting of approximately $402.9 million in cash with the remainder in Comtech Common Stock) or $8.30 per Gilat ordinary share.17Our intention would be to fund the $402.9 million cash portion of the acquisition by redeploying a large portion of both our and Gilat's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, with the remaining funds provided by a new secured credit facility (the ""Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility"") that would replace our existing Credit Facility, allow us to refinance our existing debt of approximately $149.5 million as of July 31, 2020, and allow us to fund a $5.0 million commitment related to a small pending acquisition of UHP Networks Inc. and its sister company (together, “UHP”), a leading provider of innovative and disruptive satellite ground station technology solutions..Our obligation to acquire Gilat remains subject to certain closing conditions, including (a) regulatory approval in Russia to purchase Gilat’s Russian subsidiary and (b) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on Gilat. After we announced this acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sudden and steep decline in the travel and aviation markets in which many of Gilat’s customers operate and a significant slowdown of Gilat's business. In July 2020, we commenced litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”) seeking certain declaratory judgments including a declaratory judgment that Gilat has suffered a Material Adverse Effect and that, as a result, we are not obligated to complete the acquisition of Gilat. The amended complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment that certain actions, if taken by Gilat, relating to Comtech’s application for Russian regulatory approval, would breach Gilat’s obligations under the Merger Agreement. Gilat subsequently sued in the Delaware Court for declaratory judgments, including that it has not suffered a Material Adverse Effect and that Comtech has not used reasonable best efforts to obtain Russian regulatory approval for the transaction. To-date, we incurred significant amounts of legal expenses and professional fees in connection with the litigation and a trial is scheduled for October 5, 2020. The Delaware Court has indicated that it intends to render a judgment prior to October 29, 2020, the date that we or Gilat may terminate the Merger Agreement. If we are required to close the Gilat acquisition, total net debt of the combined companies would be expected to approximate $525.0 million. The acquisition of Gilat, the status of Russian regulatory approval and related litigation is discussed in detail in Part II - ""Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Acquisition Plan Update"" and ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (13)(a) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If our acquisition with Gilat is consummated, it will pose certain risks to our business. In August 2020, Gilat publicly reported a net loss of $16.0 million and negative Adjusted EBITDA (as Gilat defines it) of $4.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. The acquisition of Gilat would significantly increase our exposure to the global in-flight connectivity solutions market, which has suffered and is expected to continue to suffer, from a material and prolonged downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If Gilat continues to experience net losses and negative Adjusted EBITDA (as it defines it), future cash flows of the combined entities will be less than currently expected and we may be unable to meet future debt service obligations, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences. Contemporaneously with entering into the agreement to acquire Gilat, we and our banking partners entered into a commitment letter with respect to the Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility. Under the terms of the commitment letter, the lender's commitment to fund the facility is subject to the condition that no Material Adverse Effect has occurred with respect to Gilat or Comtech. We face the risk that our banking partners would independently determine that a Material Adverse Effect has occurred with respect to Gilat and terminate their commitments. As a result, if we are compelled to complete the acquisition of Gilat, we may have to seek alternative financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.If our banking partners do not terminate their commitment, under the terms of the Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility we would be required to grant the lenders a security interest in substantially all our assets as collateral security for our payment obligations. Accordingly, if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we could be forced to dispose of some or all of our assets on disadvantageous terms. We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness under the Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility on favorable terms, or at all. Moreover, borrowings under the Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility following completion of the Gilat acquisition would be significantly greater than our outstanding indebtedness under our existing Credit Facility.The prospective merger with Gilat would significantly expand the types of products that we sell, expand the businesses in which we are engaged and expand our global footprint including increasing the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges as we will need to manage the substantial increase in scale resulting from the acquisition. The success of the acquisition, if completed, will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate Gilat’s workforce and complex operations (concentrated in large part in Israel and Peru), with Comtech’s business. That integration will be more difficult given the international travel restrictions still in place in many parts of the world as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. 18The operational and administrative challenges we will face as we integrate Gilat’s operations into our business include maintaining our focus on meeting all customer commitments and expectations, including supporting all existing products, services and agreements. Delays in the integration process could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Also, the diversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results may fall short of expectations. Ultimately, we may not be successful.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.Comtech’s second half of fiscal 2020, running from February 1 through July 31, 2020, corresponded almost precisely with the period in which significant worldwide restrictions on business activities were in force due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most if not all of our sales and marketing personnel were unable to travel and/or meet with customers. As a result, Comtech experienced significant order delays and lower net sales during such period. These poor business conditions have resulted in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. Because the timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict and remain ongoing, there is a risk that such conditions will have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and numerous disease control measures being taken to limit its spread. The impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include:•disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services, including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels;•temporary closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers;•permanent closures of our direct and indirect suppliers, resulting in adverse effects to our supply chain;•temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing, production and assembly facilities due to stay at home orders and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries;•increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic;•supply chain disruptions;•delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments;•cancellations in our backlog;•reductions in short- and long-term demand for our products, or other disruptions in technology buying patterns;•adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world, potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending, which may result in decreased net revenue, gross margins, or earnings and/or in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels;•delays to and/or lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity;•challenges for us, our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets;19•workforce disruptions due to illness, quarantines, governmental actions, other restrictions, and/or the social distancing measures we have taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 at certain of our locations around the world in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and of the communities in which we operate (including working from home, restricting the number of employees attending events or meetings in person, limiting the number of people in our buildings and factories at any one time, further restricting access to our facilities, suspending employee travel and inability to meet in person with customers);•increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely; and •our management team continuing to commit significant time, attention and resources to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce.The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. These impacts, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic and the measures taken in response to it, and their effects, persist for an extended period of time, or if there is a resurgence of the outbreak. Under any of these circumstances, the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or hampered by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our operations, direct and indirect suppliers, partners, and customers.Our fiscal 2021 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Historically, our business outlook is difficult to forecast and backlog (sometimes referred to herein as orders or bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; customer bankruptcies; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance and impact of acquisitions; new accounting standards; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); general global economic conditions, and the impact of natural disasters or global pandemics.During fiscal 2020, largely as a result of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on business conditions, we ceased providing specific financial targets. Although we have now reinstated providing specific forward-looking financial targets in fiscal 2021, it remains difficult to predict the timing of customer awards and related shipments and we may not meet our targets.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic conditions (or a worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic as described above) could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite ground station technologies, amplifier products and mission-critical technologies that generally have short order and lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our public safety and location technologies are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions or to perform such solutions internally. As a result of any such conditions or changes, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.In addition, a large portion of our Government Solutions segment's net sales are derived in part from large U.S. government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict.20If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.In addition to the unique business risks related to COVID-19, many of the end-markets for our products and services may be significantly impacted for other issues that result in adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are in emerging and developing countries that are subject to sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their spending. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and significantly impaired the ability of certain of our government customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from many emerging and developing countries. We believe that the current global economic business environment is unstable and sudden negative changes could result in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. The timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict. In addition, many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of financing conditions may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.The United Kingdom (""U.K."") exited from the European Union (""E.U."") on January 31, 2020. Such exit is commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". During its 11 month transition period, the U.K. and the E.U. are expected to negotiate a free trade agreement which will (i) allow U.K. goods to move around the E.U. without extra charges and (ii) keep other barriers (such as border checks) to a minimum. However, there is no guarantee that the U.K. will reach an agreement with the E.U. by December 31, 2020. If a free trade agreement is not reached, then tariffs (taxes) and full border checks will be applied to U.K. goods travelling to the E.U. We maintain production, engineering and sales facilities in the U.K. and adverse consequences concerning Brexit could result in a deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.In the past, our overall business has not been immune from adverse economic conditions. If U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate further, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations during periods of adverse conditions as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of such conditions or the impact it could have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.21•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network buildouts from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellations could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. Also, a significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with public safety and location technology solutions. Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, particularly during periods of macroeconomic instability. Nor can there be any assurance that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. The actual amount and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, a customer may not follow up with order details (e.g., delivery instructions), fluctuations in currency exchange rates after an order is placed could cause our products to become too expensive for a foreign customer, a customer’s program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early due to changes in a customer’s priorities, funding may not be included in future budgets, actual indirect rates being reimbursed on U.S. government contracts may ultimately be less than those indirect rates included in our initial proposals, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.We have incurred indebtedness under a Credit Facility, and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") with a syndicate of lenders, replacing our prior Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2016. The Credit Facility provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $550.0 million consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility with a borrowing limit of $300.0 million; (ii) an accordion feature allowing us to borrow up to an additional $250.0 million; (iii) a $35.0 million letter of credit sublimit; and (iv) a swingline loan credit sublimit of $25.0 million. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. 22As of July 31, 2020, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $149.5 million, which is reflected in the non-current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At July 31, 2020, we also had $3.1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.The Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2023. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person.As of July 31, 2020, our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) was 1.99x trailing twelve month (""TTM"") Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.75x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. Our Interest Expense Coverage Ratio as of July 31, 2020 was 14.40x TTM Adjusted EBITDA compared to the Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 3.25x TTM Adjusted EBITDA.Assuming we are not obligated to complete the Gilat acquisition, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. If we complete the Gilat acquisition, we expect to replace our Credit Facility with a new Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility, for which terms are still being negotiated. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet covenants in this new facility.Further, our ability to comply with covenants, terms of and conditions of either facility may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Moreover, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions or to fund other activities for general business purposes. If additional new debt is added to the current or planned debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings. In this regard, failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings, as well as our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. Any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and our credit ratings. In addition to the pending UHP and Gilat acquisitions, future acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to evaluate other acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Such efforts may not result in an acquisition or ultimately be beneficial to us.23Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of the acquired intangibles. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $223.4 million, $269.2 million and $202.7 million or 36.2%, 40.1% and 35.5% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2021 and beyond depends, in part, on significant new orders from the U.S. government, which undergoes extreme budgetary pressures from time to time.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect. The outcome of the national elections to be held in the U.S. in 2020 may also impact the levels of U.S. government spending.24The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these discussions could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. As such, it is possible that a shutdown of the U.S. government may occur, or interim budgets may be adopted. As such, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. Moreover, an outbreak of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantines, closures and travel restrictions may cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and distribution systems. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, accelerations, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. •Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - Our U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.25•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. TCS underwent audits by the DCAA for periods prior to Comtech’s fiscal 2016 acquisition of TCS. The DCAA has informed us that it is proposing retroactive contracts adjustments that, if finalized and issued, would result in the need for us to provide a refund to the U.S. government of approximately $2.4 million. We disagree with the DCAA’s assessment and would vigorously protest any adjustment. We have not recorded any reserve related to these audits but ultimately an adjustment may be issued. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 23.5%, 25.4% and 25.6% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.26•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes in certain cases. If the U.S. dollar strengthens from current levels against many international currencies, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC.•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we have conducted no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of export control laws or regulations to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (""DDTC""), DoC and OFAC. In addition, we have made various commitments to U.S. government agencies that oversee trade and export matters and have committed that we will maintain certain policies and procedures including maintaining a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. Additionally, we have agreed to have independent audits in future periods and will report any future violations to those agencies. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. export control laws or regulations, including trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. If it is determined that we have violated U.S. export control laws or regulations or trade regulations, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm.•We are subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We are subject to future compliance audits that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.27•We may be affected by the future imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions - The current U.S. administration has signaled support for, and in some instances has taken action with respect to, major changes to certain trade policies, such as the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products, the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements and the imposition of certain export sanctions. Such changes could result in retaliatory actions by the United States’ trade partners. For example, over the last several months, the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imports from China, as well as on steel and aluminum products imported from various countries and imposed export sanctions on certain Chinese entities. In response, China, the European Union, and several other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies, including, in connection with our business with customers outside of the United States or with newly sanctioned entities could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2020, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $330.5 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2020, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $258.0 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segment each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.On August 1, 2020 (the first day of our fiscal 2021), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches, and taking into consideration both the potential short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 8.4% and 78.0%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.However, it is possible that, during fiscal 2021 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could decline further. Such deterioration could be caused by uncertainty about the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on global business activity.A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2021 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. 28In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2021 (the start of our fiscal 2022). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2020. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a system failure, lack of or failure of redundant system components, security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems. If such occurs, in some cases, we may have to reimburse our customers for damages that they may have incurred, pay contract penalties, or provide refunds. Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber-attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third-party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT networks and systems, as well as third-party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to public safety agencies, wireless carriers as well as national security and other sensitive government functions. Many of our systems have, or are required to have, system redundancies and back-up; in some cases, we may not have sufficient redundancy and/or redundancy and/or back-ups may fail. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to system failures, failure of redundant system components, actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of public safety and location technologies (including 911 hosted systems), we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third-party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customers' IT networks and related systems. These types of information, IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information, IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, and disruptions have occurred and will occur again in the future. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption (including as a result of a lack of redundancy and/or failure of such redundancy) involving these types of information, IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functionality of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; 29•Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results; •Make payments to our customers to reimburse them for damages, pay them penalties or provide refunds; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third-party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In the event of such disclosure, we also may be subject to claims of breach of contract, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2017 through 2019 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2016 are subject to audit. None of TCS' state income tax returns prior to calendar year 2015 are subject to audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state excise tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, Maryland, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. 30Although many of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.We currently, and intend to continue to, operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Arizona. The COVID-19 pandemic, a terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. To support our long-term business goals for our satellite earth station product line, in September 2020, we signed a 15-year lease for a 146,000 square foot facility in Chandler, Arizona. This facility is located less than 10 miles from our existing facility located in Tempe, Arizona, and we anticipate that that we will fully relocated by February 2021. If we are unable to have a smooth transition to our new facility, production and deliveries of our products may be impacted and may incur unexpected costs. We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line. We maintain operations in Maryland near a U.S. Navy facility which is more prone to a terrorist attack. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our antenna production facility in the United Kingdom), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and business shutdowns both domestically and globally, including in locations in which we have significant operations. These or any further political, governmental or other actions to contain the spread or treat the impact of COVID-19, and the resulting developments, are highly uncertain and unpredictable and could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.31The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG-911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG-911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG-911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and/or more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.32Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile communications industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Recently, there has been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.33All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services or future industry standards embodying new technologies, such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a one-time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one-time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.34Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides public safety and location technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives, or our distributors may not be successful. We also began an evaluation and repositioning of certain of our location technology solutions within our Commercial Solutions segment in order to focus on providing higher margin solution offerings and increase our penetration into the public safety space. To date, we have ceased offering certain location technology solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under firm fixed-price contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. 35•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Also, the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. As further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we note the following:•We must maintain compliance with new complex revenue recognition rules - On August 1, 2018 (our first quarter of fiscal 2019), we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry specific requirements, and provides a single revenue recognition model for contracts with customers. The ASU applies to all open contracts existing as of August 1, 2018. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method and there was no material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •We must maintain compliance with new complex lease accounting rules - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" to revise existing lease accounting guidance. The update requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use asset. We adopted Topic 842 on August 1, 2019, the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020. Except for recording a total right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which amount approximates 4.0% of our total consolidated assets at July 31, 2019, our adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact to our statements of operations or cash flows. We must comply with these new rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these new accounting standards, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to them, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex rules.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.36We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical and/or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical and management personnel. Many of our key and technical management personnel would be difficult to replace and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters and some work out of their respective homes. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to-date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During the past year or so, and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.37•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third-party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third-party data and content increases substantially.•Third-party data centers or third-party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and location technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which are hosted at third-party data centers, and on the networks, as well as within the data centers of our wireless carrier partners. The third-party facilities are in Irvine, California, San Francisco, California, Dallas, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina, and we may use others as required. We also use third-party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. Additionally, certain non-911 products, technologies, and solutions are currently hosted in cloud-based applications operated by third parties such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers, customer data centers, and cloud providers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.38Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents or due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.The Company's assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, employee claims, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. For example, in March 2019, we initiated litigation against a former employee and her new employer arising from such former employee's violation of her obligation to TCS of confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees. The former employee has responded with her own lawsuit against us.Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    For additional information related to these lawsuits, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (13)(a) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors.Our products including software may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.39Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may impact some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.40From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved, and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner. Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon which accounted for 8.8% of our sales in fiscal 2020, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers are constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from such free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer such technology to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers, such as Verizon which accounted for 8.8% of our revenues in fiscal 2020. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.41If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as Verizon, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•our ability to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In addition to potential issuances of our shares of common stock associated with the pending acquisitions of Gilat and UHP, in the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.42In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our Common Stock dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly common stock dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends with respect to our Common Stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Credit Facility or potentially the Gilat Acquisition Related Credit Facility. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future Common Stock dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility, as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay common stock dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Credit Facility, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
5,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2019-09-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Risks Related to our BusinessOur fiscal 2020 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Although we currently believe overall market conditions for our business are positive and that our business performance in fiscal 2020 will be better than fiscal 2019, there can be no assurance of such results. Our business outlook is difficult to forecast and backlog (sometimes referred to herein as orders or bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance and impact of acquisitions; new accounting standards; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic conditions could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite ground station technologies, amplifier products and mission-critical technologies that generally have short order and lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our public safety and location technologies are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions. As a result of any such conditions or changes, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.In addition, a large portion of our Government Solutions segment's net sales are derived in part from large U.S. government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict.If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment, it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.Although overall current market conditions are strong, many of the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted in the past by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are in emerging and developing countries that are subject to sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their spending. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and significantly impaired the ability of certain of our government customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. 15The business environment is currently stable; however, a sudden change could result in the immediate suppression of end-market demand for many of our products such as satellite ground station technologies and other short-lead time products. The timing, impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict. In addition, many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of interest rates may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.Currently, the United Kingdom (""U.K."") is attempting to negotiate an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as ""Brexit."" Although we currently do not sell any significant amount of equipment in the U.K. or maintain large operations in the U.K., adverse consequences concerning Brexit could result in a deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.In the past, our overall business has not been immune from adverse economic conditions. If U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations during periods of adverse conditions as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of such conditions or the impact it could have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network buildouts from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.We have incurred indebtedness under a Credit Facility and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Facility"") with a syndicate of lenders, replacing our prior Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2016. The new Credit Facility, as amended, provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $550.0 million consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility with a borrowing limit of $300.0 million; (ii) an accordion feature allowing us to borrow up to an additional $250.0 million; (iii) a $35.0 million letter of credit sublimit; and (iv) a swingline loan credit sublimit of $25.0 million. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. As of July 31, 2019, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $165.0 million, which is reflected in the non-current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At July 31, 2019, we also had $2.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts.The Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2023. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.16Our Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person.As of July 31, 2019, our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility, as amended) was 1.74x trailing twelve month (""TTM"") Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility, as amended) compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.75x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. Our Interest Expense Coverage Ratio as of July 31, 2019 was 12.05x TTM Adjusted EBITDA compared to the Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 3.25x TTM Adjusted EBITDA.Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Future acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.As we enter fiscal 2020, we are involved with acquisition efforts to acquire companies that have complimentary solution offerings. In addition, we expect to continue to evaluate other acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Such efforts may not result in an acquisition or ultimately be beneficial to us.Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of the acquired intangibles. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.17Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $269.2 million, $202.7 million and $180.0 million or 40.1%, 35.5% and 32.7% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2020 and beyond depends, in part, on significant new orders from the U.S. government, which undergoes extreme budgetary pressures from time to time.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these discussions could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. As such, it is possible that a shutdown of the U.S. government may occur, or interim budgets may be adopted. As such, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.18Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, accelerations, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. •Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - Our U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. TCS has recently undergone audits by the DCAA for periods prior to Comtech’s fiscal 2016 acquisition of TCS and the DCAA has informed us that it is proposing retroactive contracts adjustments that, if finalized and issued, would result in the need for us to provide a refund to the U.S. government of approximately $2.4 million. We disagree with the DCAA’s assessment and would vigorously protest any adjustment. We have not recorded any reserve related to these audits but ultimately an adjustment may be issued. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.19Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 25.4%, 25.6% and 28.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes in certain cases. If the U.S. dollar strengthens from current levels against many international currencies, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC.20•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we have conducted virtually no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the DDTC and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. In October 2014, we disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority. The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000. At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan. In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking further information about the disclosed transaction. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization. In September 2018, Comtech agreed to enter into a Tolling Agreement with OFAC, which extends the statute of limitations in this matter through December 31, 2019. The Tolling Agreement was shortly followed by a second administrative subpoena seeking additional information about the disclosed transaction. In December 2018, Comtech responded to a second administrative subpoena from OFAC, answering the questions it posed and providing all the documents it sought. U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked in 2017. Consistent with the revocation of the SSR, shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible. We are not able to predict whether OFAC will take any enforcement action against us in light of the recent revocation of the SSR. If OFAC determines that we have violated U.S. trade sanctions, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. In May 2018, we were informed by the Office of Export Enforcement (""OEE"") of the Department of Commerce (""DoC"") that it was forwarding to the DoC's Office of Chief Counsel, the results of its audit of international shipments by Comtech Xicom Technology, Inc. for further review and possible determination of an administrative penalty. We fully cooperated with the OEE in their audit and, based on our self-assessment of the approximately 7,800 individual transactions audited, have determined that six (6) transactions may not have been fully in compliance with the EAR. These six (6) items, for which export licenses were not obtained, were either spares or repaired power amplifier subassembly components valued at less than $100,000 (in aggregate) and were shipped to Brazil, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. The EAR provides an exception to the requirement to obtain an export license for the replacement of a defective or damaged component. During our self-assessment, we determined that we inadvertently did not obtain export licenses for the spares or have evidence of the return or destruction of the defective or damaged components necessary to authorize our use of the export license exception for the replacements. Since discovering this issue, we have implemented additional controls and procedures and have increased awareness of these specific export requirements throughout the Company to help avoid similar occurrences in the future. Administrative penalties under the EAR can range from a warning letter to a denial of export privileges. A civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in the Export Administration Act (""EAA"") may be imposed for each violation, and in the event that any provision of the EAR is continued by any other authority, the maximum monetary civil penalty for each violation shall be that provided by such other authority. Administrative penalties under the EAR are currently determined pursuant to the IEEPA, which can reach the greater of twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation or approximately $300,000 per violation. We have not recorded an accrual related to a possible administrative penalty and continue to work cooperatively with the OEE.21•We may be subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We may be subjected to compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may be affected by the future imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions - The current U.S. administration has signaled support for, and in some instances has taken action with respect to, major changes to certain trade policies, such as the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products, the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements and the imposition of certain export sanctions. Such changes could result in retaliatory actions by the United States’ trade partners. For example, over the last several months, the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imports from China, as well as on steel and aluminum products imported from various countries and imposed export sanctions on certain Chinese entities. In response, China, the European Union, and several other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies, including, in connection with our business with customers outside of the United States or with newly sanctioned entities could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2019, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $310.5 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2019, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $261.9 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segment each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. On August 1, 2019 (the first day of our fiscal 2020), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 29.0% and 122.2%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment. It is possible that, during fiscal 2020 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could decline. A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2020 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. 22In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2020 (the start of our fiscal 2021). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2019. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a systems failure, lack of or failure of a redundancy, security breach through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third-party data center facilities, servers and related systems. If such occurs in some cases, we may have to reimburse our customers for damages that they may have incurred, pay contract penalties, or provide refunds. Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third-party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT network and systems, as well as third-party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to public safety agencies, wireless carriers as well as national security and other sensitive government functions. Many of our systems have, or are required to have, system redundancies and back-up; in some cases, we may not have sufficient redundancy and/or redundancy and/or back-ups may fail. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to system failures, failure of redundancies, actual breaches, cyber attacks and other systems disruptions.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of public safety and location technologies (including 911 hosted systems), we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third-party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, and disruptions have occurred and will occur again in the future. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption (including as a result of a lack of redundancy and/or failure of such redundancy) involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results; •Make payments to our customers to reimburse them for damages, or pay them penalties or provide refunds; and23•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third-party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We also may be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2015 are subject to audit. TCS' federal income tax returns for tax year 2015 and the tax period from January 1, 2016 to February 23, 2016, the date we acquired TCS, are subject to potential future IRS audit. None of TCS' state income tax returns prior to calendar year 2014 are subject to audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state excise tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, Maryland, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. 24Although many of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line. We maintain operations in Maryland near a U.S. Navy facility which is more prone to a terrorist attack. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.25The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG-911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG-911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG-911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and/or more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.26Regulation of the mobile communications industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile communications industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Recently, there has been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for personal data protection. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.27All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services or future industry standards embodying new technologies, such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a one-time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one-time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.28Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides public safety and location technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives, or our distributors may not be successful. For example, in fiscal 2019, AT&T informed us that it will move all 911 call routing solutions to a competitor in full by April 2020. We also began an evaluation and repositioning of certain of our location technology solutions within our Commercial Solutions segment in order to focus on providing higher margin solution offerings and increase our penetration into the public safety space. To date, we have ceased offering certain location technology solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.Contract cost growth on our firm fixed-price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under firm fixed-price contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. 29•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Also the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. As further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we note the following:•We must maintain compliance with new complex revenue recognition rules - On August 1, 2018 (our first quarter of fiscal 2019), we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry specific requirements, and provides a single revenue recognition model for contracts with customers. The ASU applies to all open contracts existing as of August 1, 2018. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method and there was no material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •We must maintain compliance with new complex lease accounting rules - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" to revise existing lease accounting guidance. The update requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease liability, with a corresponding right‑of‑use asset. We adopted Topic 842 on August 1, 2019, the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020. Except for recording a total right -of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which amount approximates 4.0% of our total consolidated assets at July 31, 2019, our adoption of Topic 842 is not expected to have a material impact to our future statements of operations or cash flows. We continue to evaluate our adoption of this new standard, as well as our ongoing financial reporting disclosures requirements. We must comply with these new rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these new accounting standards, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to them, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex rules.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.30Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. A portion of our backlog is determined based on contracts received from our customers (such as the U.S. government and large wireless carriers) and in certain cases, is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. As such, there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised.A significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with public safety and location technology solutions. Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical and/or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical and management personnel. Many of our key and technical management personnel would be difficult to replace and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters and some work out of their respective homes. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to-date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.31•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During the past year or so, and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.We rely upon various third-party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third-party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third-party data and content increases substantially.32•Third-party data centers or third-party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and location technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third-party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. Certain of our data centers are currently hosted in cloud-based applications operated by third parties such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft or third-party facilities located in Irvine, California, San Francisco, California, Dallas, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina, and we may use others as required. We also use third-party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents or due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.The Company's assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.33We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, relating to our software, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    For example, a customer that purchased a TCS 911 call handling software solution in December 2014 (which was more than one year prior to our acquisition of TCS) (the ""TCS Legacy Customer"") informed us that it experienced several network outages and that it would seek indemnification for any claims made against it as a result of such outages. Settlement conversations were had with this customer for several months and a mutual agreement was not reached. In September 2019, this customer filed a lawsuit which has accused us of committing fraud because, among other things, we failed to provide them with supposedly promised redundancy. We vigorously contest that we violated any contractual obligations, much less committed fraud, and have submitted notification to our insurance carriers of the lawsuit for review and consideration of coverage for potential liability that may arise from this lawsuit. We are also reviewing with counsel our multiple counter claims against this TCS Legacy Customer. For additional information related to this lawsuit, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (13)(b) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. TCS had a call handling software solution developed more than ten years ago and was licensed to customers prior to our acquisition of TCS. Older versions of this software solution remain deployed by certain end-customers. In fiscal 2016, AT&T, a distributor of this small TCS product line, informed us that they did not believe we met certain contractual specifications related to performance and usability of the software solution. During fiscal 2018, we entered into a full and final warranty settlement with AT&T, pursuant to which we issued thirty-six credits to AT&T of $0.2 million, which AT&T can apply on a monthly basis to purchases of solutions from us, beginning October 2017 through September 2020. For additional information related to this warranty settlement, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (6) - Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our current accrued warranty obligations at July 31, 2019 include $4.0 million of warranty obligations for the legacy TCS 911 call handling software solution. Our warranty liability associated with this issue was determined based on a review of contractual obligations, estimates of costs to enhance the software and include the terms of settlement with AT&T. We believe our customer support plan, which includes an intention to continue to support end-customers in exchange for an annual customer support fee, has mitigated the negative reputational impact of this issue. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales related to the legacy TCS 911 call handling software solution were $6.6 million, $7.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively. A significant portion of such sales were derived from our relationship with AT&T. Sales in fiscal 2020 for this old product line are expected to decline to virtually zero. Ultimately, our estimated warranty costs for this product may not be sufficient. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors. 34Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may impact some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved, and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.35From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner. Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon which accounted for 9.1% of our sales in fiscal 2019, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers are constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from such free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer such technology to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Potential future business combinations among wireless network operators could result in a loss of revenue for our business.The telecommunications industry generally is currently undergoing a consolidation phase. For example, T-Mobile US, Inc. (""T-Mobile"") and Sprint Corporation have announced a merger. We currently generate several million dollars of revenue from both of these companies and we are uncertain of the impact that this merger may have on us in the future. Many of our customers, specifically wireless carrier customers of our Commercial Solutions segment, have or may become the target of acquisitions. If the number of our customers is significantly reduced as a result of this consolidation trend, or if the resulting companies do not utilize our product offerings, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers, such as Verizon which accounted for 9.1% of our revenues in fiscal 2019. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as Verizon, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.36Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•our ability to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.37A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Credit Facility, as amended. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under the Company's Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Credit Facility, as amended, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
16,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2018-09-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Risks Related to our BusinessOur fiscal 2019 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Customer orders (sometimes referred to herein as bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; changing customer partnering procurement strategies; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards such as those relating to acquisitions, revenue recognition and leasing; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in bookings, net sales and operating results from period to period. For example, a sudden change in global economic conditions could have an immediate impact on a large portion of our Commercial Solutions segment net sales, a large amount of which are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and certain traveling wave tube amplifier products that generally have short lead times. Similarly, sales of certain of our enterprise technology solutions and safety and security technology solutions are subject to sudden changes in wireless carrier procurement strategies, including decisions to sole-source such solutions. As a result of any such conditions or changes, bookings and backlog related to these solutions are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.A large portion of our Government Solutions segment net sales are derived in part from large U.S. Government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles (including funding requirements) and are therefore difficult to predict. In addition, we continue to execute on our Government Solutions segment's shift away from bidding on large commodity service contracts and toward pursuing contracts for our niche products with higher margins.  Although we believe this tactical shift will ultimately yield higher operating income, in dollars, as well as higher operating income as a percentage of net sales, this shift could result in fluctuations in our business, results of operations and financial condition that we may not be able to accurately forecast.Although the integration of the fiscal 2016 TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. (""TCS"") acquisition into our business is largely complete, ongoing activity may continue to divert our resources and management's attention.In February 2016, in connection with the acquisition of TCS, we reorganized our business into two reportable operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions and integrated TCS businesses into each segment. Although this integration is largely complete, we may further change our business and organizational structure and streamline and further consolidate certain business processes to achieve greater operating efficiencies. The acquisition of TCS has significantly expanded the types of products and services that we sell, expanded the businesses in which we engage, and increased the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in scale of our business. These challenges include the integration of a large number of systems, both operational and administrative. We have also made a number of management changes in certain TCS product lines. We may not be able to successfully manage these organizational changes and the unanticipated disruption to our business that might result from these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the diversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The ongoing success of the TCS acquisition will depend on maintaining the efficiencies and cost savings we have achieved to-date, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to do so.18If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment, it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.For the past several years, many of the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that continue to undergo sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world have also cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices plunged, significantly impairing the ability of our customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies, as compared to several years ago, has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. The business environment in the past several years resulted in the suppression of end-market demand for many of our satellite earth station products. Although economic conditions have improved, we continue to believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of interest rates may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.In 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as ""Brexit."" As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will negotiate the terms of the U.K.’s future relationships with European Union member states. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.In the past, our overall business has not been immune from adverse economic conditions. Although business conditions improved in fiscal 2018 as compared to prior years and were relatively strong, if U.S. or global economic conditions deteriorate, or political conditions become unstable, or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations during periods of adverse conditions as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of such conditions or the impact it could have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - In the past, our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may again reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build-outs from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.19We have incurred indebtedness under a Secured Credit Facility, and may not be able to service that debt in the future and we must maintain compliance with various covenants that impose restrictions on our business.We have a Secured Credit Facility, as amended June 6, 2017, which provides for borrowing availability of up to $400.0 million and is secured by substantially all of our assets. As of July 31, 2018, we had $168.7 million of borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, of which $120.1 million is from an original $250.0 million Term Loan A and $48.6 million of drawings under a $150.0 million revolving credit line. The Secured Credit Facility, as amended, requires quarterly payments and repayment in full by February 23, 2021. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. As of July 31, 2018, our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) was 2.19x trailing twelve month (""TTM"") Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) as of July 31, 2018 was 2.33x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x. Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.20Future acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to consider future acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $202.7 million, $180.0 million and $167.5 million or 35.5%, 32.7% and 40.8% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2019 and beyond depends, in part, on new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budgetary pressures.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.21The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present.Ultimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues.  Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse related to: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. •Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress - U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years.  Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government - As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts.  If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.22In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 25.6%, 28.4% and 30.0% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To-date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes. Although monetary conditions in fiscal 2018 improved as compared to recent years, it is possible, that the U.S. dollar will strengthen from current levels against many international currencies. If this occurs, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported.  In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (""IEEPA""), the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (""OFAC"").23•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have conducted virtually no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the DDTC and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. In October 2014, we disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority. The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000. At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan. In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking further information about the disclosed transaction. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization. Subsequently, in October 2017, U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked. Consistent with the revocation of the Sudan Sanction Regulations (""SSR""), shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible. We are not able to predict when OFAC will complete its review, nor whether it will take any enforcement action against us in light of the recent revocation of the SSR. If OFAC determines that we have violated U.S. trade sanctions, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance.In May 2018, we were informed by the Office of Export Enforcement (""OEE"") of the Department of Commerce (""DoC"") that it was forwarding to the DoC's Office of Chief Counsel, the results of its audit of international shipments by Comtech Xicom Technology, Inc. for further review and possible determination of an administrative penalty. We fully cooperated with the OEE in their audit and, based on our self-assessment of the approximately 7,800 individual transactions audited, have determined that six (6) transactions may not have been fully in compliance with the EAR. These six (6) items, for which export licenses were not obtained, were either spares or repaired power amplifier subassembly components valued at less than $100,000 (in aggregate) and were shipped to Brazil, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. The EAR provides an exception to the requirement to obtain an export license for the replacement of a defective or damaged component. During our self-assessment, we determined that we inadvertently did not obtain export licenses for the spares, or had evidence of the return or destruction of the defective or damaged components necessary to authorize our use of the export license exception for the replacements. Since discovering this issue, we have implemented additional controls and procedures and have increased awareness of these specific export requirements throughout the Company to help avoid similar occurrences in the future. Administrative penalties under the EAR can range from a warning letter to a denial of export privileges. Given the lapsed legal status of the Export Administration Act (""EAA"") itself, administrative penalties under the EAR are currently determined pursuant to the IEEPA, which can reach the greater of twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation or approximately $300,000 per violation. We have not recorded an accrual related to a possible administrative penalty and continue to work cooperatively with the OEE.24•We may be subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. We may be subjected to compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2018, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $290.6 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2018, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $240.8 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segment each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No. 2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. On August 1, 2018 (the first day of our fiscal 2019), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 42.5% and 105.5%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment. It is possible that, during fiscal 2019 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate, or our common stock price could decline. A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2019 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2019 (the start of our fiscal 2020). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2018. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.25We could be negatively impacted by a systems failure or security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third party data center facilities, servers and related systems.Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant cyber-attack and are subject to an ongoing risk of security breaches and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT network and systems, as well as third party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of 911 systems, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, and disruptions have occurred and will occur again in the future. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damage that results; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.26The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We also may be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damage caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Since November 2017, our federal income tax return for fiscal 2016 has been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""). The audit is ongoing and we are unaware of any proposed adjustments by the IRS. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 and 2017 are also subject to potential future IRS audit. None of our state income tax returns prior to fiscal 2014 are subject to audit. TCS' federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 and the tax period from January 1, 2016 to February 23, 2016 are subject to potential future IRS audit. None of TCS' state income tax returns prior to calendar year 2013 are subject to audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state and local excise tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal income tax returns (including the recent audit of fiscal 2014) were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, our 911 hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events.  Although all of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.27We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line.  Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC.  We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.28•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (""IP"") based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.Regulation of the mobile industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information in the resale of certain of our products. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.29Recently, there has been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.  The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.30Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a onetime fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a onetime fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides Safety and Security Technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives or our distributors may not be successful. For example, in February 2016, AT&T, one of our largest partners publicly announced a new nationwide service that is focused on the adoption of NG911 services and that such new service will be deployed in collaboration with a competitor.  In fiscal 2018, we were informed by two of our large distributors that they did not win two large programs which included our NG911 solutions and that AT&T was awarded both programs. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channel in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.31Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. •Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of ASC 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.32•We must maintain compliance with new complex revenue recognition rules - The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. As further discussed in ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (1)(c) - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies - Revenue Recognition"" included in ""Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" on August 1, 2018 (our first quarter of fiscal 2019), we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2014-09 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry specific requirements, and provides a single revenue recognition model for contracts with customers. The ASU applies to all open contracts existing as of August 1, 2018. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method and there was no material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In fiscal 2019, we expect to recognize a significant portion of our contracts over time, as there is a continuous transfer of control to the customer over the contractual period of performance. The remainder of our contracts will be recognized at a point in time. Both of these methods are similar to what we did prior to August 1, 2018. We must comply with these new revenue recognition rules on a go-forward basis. Because of the uncertainties of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with these new accounting policies, as well as with any future guidance or interpretations related to the new standard, we may incur additional costs and cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with such complex revenue recognition rules.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. A portion of our backlog is determined based on contracts received from our customers (such as the U.S. government and large wireless carriers) and in certain cases, is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements.  There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. As such, there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised.A significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with safety and security solutions.  Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.33We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel. Many of our key technical management personnel would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to-date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully on price or other terms, or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Recently, we have seen increased requests for proposals from large wireless carriers for sole-source solutions and have responded to several such requests including those from AT&T and Verizon. In order to induce retention of existing customer contracts and obtain business on a sole-source basis, we may ultimately agree to adjust pricing on a retroactive basis. If our sole-source proposals are rejected in favor of a competitor’s proposal, it could result in the termination of existing contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. During fiscal 2018, and as a result of overall increased industry-wide demand, lead times for many components have increased. In addition, threats of or actual tariffs could limit our ability to obtain certain parts on a cost-effective basis, or at all. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.34We rely upon various third party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.  We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest.  If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially.•Third party data centers or third party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and enterprise technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. Certain of our data centers are currently hosted in cloud based applications operated by third parties such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft or third party facilities located in Irvine, California, San Francisco, California, Dallas, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina, and we may use others as required. We also use third party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third party data centers we use. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location-based services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely upon ""open-source"" software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims.  Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. 35In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents and due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.For example, we have accrued certain costs related to Vehicle IP, LLC (""Vehicle IP"") which filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court""). For additional information, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Company's assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, relating to our software, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solution, must meet stringent customer technical requirements and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our 911 call handling software solution is a small product line developed by TCS more than ten years ago. Such solution was licensed to customers prior to our acquisition of TCS and older versions of this software solution remain deployed by certain end-customers. In fiscal 2016, AT&T, a distributor of this small TCS product line, informed us that they did not believe we met certain contractual specifications related to performance and usability of the software solution. During fiscal 2018, we entered into a full and final warranty settlement with AT&T, pursuant to which we issued thirty-six credits to AT&T of $0.2 million, which AT&T can apply on a monthly basis to purchases of solutions from us, beginning October 2017 through September 2020.  For additional information related to this warranty settlement, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (6) - Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our current accrued warranty obligations at July 31, 2018 include $4.7 million of warranty obligations for the TCS 911 call handling software solution. Our warranty liability associated with this issue was determined based on a review of contractual obligations, estimates of costs to enhance the software and include the terms of settlement with AT&T. We believe our customer support plan, which includes an intention to continue to support end-customers in exchange for an annual customer support fee, has mitigated the negative reputational impact of this issue. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, 911 call handling software solution sales were $7.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively. A significant portion of such sales were derived from our relationship with AT&T. Sales in fiscal 2019 for this product line are currently expected to be similar to the amounts achieved in fiscal 2018 and 2017.Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors. 36Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.37From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.A change in our relationship with our large wireless carrier customers could have a material adverse effect.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, a change in purchasing or procurement strategies by a wireless carrier partner could result in the loss of business from that partner.  Additionally, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Even when we successfully negotiate a multi-period contract, our wireless carrier contracts, such as the ones with Verizon and AT&T, provide for terminations with notice and provide a mechanism for the wireless carrier to renegotiate lower fees and/or change services. Fee pressure from these carriers are constant and ongoing. Thus, even when we obtain a multi-period contract term, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer these location-based services to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Potential future business combinations among wireless network operators could result in a loss of revenue for our business.The telecommunications industry generally is currently undergoing a consolidation phase. For example, T-Mobile US, Inc. (""T-Mobile"") and Sprint Corporation have announced a merger. We currently generate revenue from both of these companies and we are uncertain of the impact that this merger may have on us in the future. Many of our customers, specifically wireless carrier customers of our Commercial Solutions segment, have or may become the target of acquisitions. If the number of our customers is significantly reduced as a result of this consolidation trend, or if the resulting companies do not utilize our product offerings, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all or renegotiate lower fees with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be suddenly and materially adversely affected.     We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers, such as Verizon and AT&T. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end-users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. To-date, a relatively small number of end-users have subscribed for our services in connection with their wireless plans compared to the total number of mobile phone users. Our future growth depends, in part, on achieving significantly increased subscriber adoption of the wireless communication solutions we sell either through standalone subscriptions to our solutions or as part of bundles from our existing wireless carrier partners. Our success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of our solutions by attracting and retaining wireless carrier partners. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services included in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.38If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as Verizon and AT&T, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•our ability to successfully integrate TCS and manage our combined company;•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.39In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Secured Credit Facility, as amended. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under the Company's Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
6,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2017-09-27,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Risks Related to our BusinessOur fiscal 2018 business outlook is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Our new orders (sometimes referred to herein as bookings), net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions, revenue recognition and leasing; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results from period to period. A large portion of our Commercial Solutions segment net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and certain traveling wave tube amplifier products that generally have short lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. A large portion of our Government Solutions segment net sales are derived in part from large U.S. Government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and are therefore difficult to predict.In fiscal 2016, we completed our acquisition of TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. (""TCS""), the largest acquisition in our history. Fiscal 2016 included five months of TCS operations. Fiscal 2017 included the operations of TCS for a twelve-month period. As such, fiscal 2018 is expected to be the first comparative twelve month fiscal period including TCS operations. Although the integration of TCS into our business is largely complete, our ability to accurately forecast future performance will continue to be dependent upon our ability to fully familiarize ourselves with the variability of the business and environment in which TCS operates. Although we expect to continue to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the TCS acquisition, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. In particular, the ongoing success of the TCS acquisition will depend on maintaining the efficiencies and cost savings we have achieved to date, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to do so.Our ongoing tactical shift in our Government Solutions segment toward pursuing contracts with higher margins may not prove successful. We continue to execute on our shift in efforts in our Government Solutions segment away from bidding on large commodity service contracts and toward pursuing contracts for our niche products with higher margins. Although we are beginning to see the benefits of this strategy, in the short-term, this strategy has resulted, and may continue to result, in lower net sales and operating income, in dollars, in our Government Solutions segment. Although we believe this tactical shift will ultimately yield higher operating income, in dollars, as well as higher operating income as a percentage of net sales, we may not be able to successfully execute this strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.17If global economic business and political conditions deteriorate as compared to the current environment, it could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.For the past several years, many of the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that continue to undergo sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world have also cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them. In recent years, global oil and natural gas prices plunged, significantly impairing the ability of our customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies, as compared to several years ago, has negatively impacted the purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. The business environment in the past several years resulted in the suppression of end-market demand for many of our satellite earth station products. Although economic conditions have improved, we continue to believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of interest rates may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.In 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will negotiate the terms of the U.K.’s future relationships with European Union member states. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.In the past, our overall business has not been immune from adverse economic conditions. Although business conditions in fiscal 2017 improved as compared to prior years and were relatively stable during fiscal 2017, if political conditions around the world become unstable or additional economic sanctions are imposed on some of our end-customers, it could adversely impact our sales. If business conditions become adverse, our business could be impacted in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations during adverse conditions as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of such conditions or the impact it could have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - Our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. In the future, our customers may reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build-outs from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.18Although the integration of the fiscal 2016 TCS acquisition into our business is largely complete, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the TCS acquisition, the acquisition may ultimately not be successful and ongoing activity may continue to divert our resources and management attention.The acquisition of TCS continues to have a number of unique risks, including:•We may not be able to continue to manage organizational changes associated with the TCS acquisition - As of February 1, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of TCS, we reorganized our business into two reportable operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. Although this integration is largely complete, we may further change our business and organizational structure and streamline and further consolidate certain business processes to achieve greater operating efficiencies. The acquisition of TCS has significantly expanded the types of products and services that we sell, expanded the businesses in which we engage, and increased the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in scale of our business. These challenges include the integration of a large number of systems, both operational and administrative. We may not be able to successfully manage these organizational changes and the unanticipated disruption to our business that might result from these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the diversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We may experience a loss or adverse effect on customer relationships - The acquisition of TCS may adversely affect the relationships that the combined company has with its customers, service providers and employees. As a result of the acquisition, we may experience a loss of, or changes to, TCS’s relationships with its customers or Comtech’s legacy customers, which could negatively impact our business outlook. Our future growth depends in part on expanding relationships with key distribution channels for TCS products such as Next Generation 911 solutions. If we are unable to capitalize on those relationships or if we lose existing relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain personnel could adversely affect our future business, operations and financial results.Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. If we are unable to do so, our business could be harmed. We have incurred indebtedness under a Secured Credit Facility, and may not be able to service that debt in the future.In connection with the acquisition of TCS, we entered into a Secured Credit Facility, as amended June 6, 2017, which provides for borrowing availability of up to $400.0 million. As of July 31, 2017, we had approximately $196.5 million of borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, of which $139.1 million is from an original $250.0 million Term Loan A and $57.4 million of drawings under a $150.0 million revolving credit line. The Secured Credit Facility, as amended, requires quarterly payments and repayment in full by February 23, 2021. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. If we are unable to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses, as we have pledged substantially all of our assets to the lenders as security for our payment obligations.19Our Secured Credit Facility, as amended June 6, 2017, contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and, as a result, may reduce our profitability.Our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. As of July 31, 2017, our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) was 2.84x TTM Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.75x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. In fiscal 2018, the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio will decrease each quarter until reaching 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, with no further reductions thereafter. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility, as amended) as of July 31, 2017 was 1.95x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x, which will not change for the remaining term of the Secured Credit Facility, as amended. Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Future acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to consider future acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.20Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $180.0 million, $167.5 million and $94.0 million or 32.7%, 40.8% and 30.6% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. In addition, a large portion of our existing backlog consists of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our business outlook for fiscal 2018 and beyond depends, in part, on new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budgetary pressures.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our receipt of future orders depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to reduce or delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates, including sequestration or mandated reductions which are currently in effect, could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present.Ultimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact both of our operating segments. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.21Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business, commercial and government audit risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues.  Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to contracts with the U.S. government, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•Our U.S. government contracts can easily be terminated by the U.S. government - Our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. •Our U.S. government contracts are subject to funding by the U.S. Congress -  U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years.  Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.•We can be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government -  As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts.  If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.In addition, all of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.22Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to unique business, commercial and export compliance audit risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 28.4%, 30.0% and 56.2% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes. Although monetary conditions in fiscal 2017 improved as compared to recent years, it is possible, that the U.S. dollar will strengthen from current levels against many international currencies. If this occurs, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries - Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported.  In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (""OFAC"").23•We must comply with the FCPA and similar laws elsewhere - We are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we have conducted virtually no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. •We must maintain a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance - In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the DDTC and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. In October 2014, we self-disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a routine assessment of the adequacy of our export control compliance procedures that we had inadvertently neglected to obtain an OFAC license for a shipment of modems to a Canadian customer who, we learned after the transaction had begun, intended to incorporate our modems in a communication system the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority.  OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly in Sudan and from facilitating transactions by non-U.S. persons which would be illegal if done by a U.S. person.  In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena to us seeking further information about the previous voluntarily disclosed transaction and any other transactions involving Sudan. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon after which time the modems were rerouted to Sudan without Comtech’s knowledge. OFAC has not responded to our submission of further information and we cannot predict when the agency will complete its review and determine whether any violations occurred. While OFAC could decide not to impose penalties and only issue a no action or cautionary letter, we could face civil and criminal penalties and may suffer reputational harm if we are found to have violated U.S. sanctions laws. Even though we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, any such measures, or any new measures we may implement in the future, may be ineffective. As a result, there is risk that in the future we could provide our products to or permit our products to be downloaded or accessed by such targets despite these precautions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.  •We may be subject to future export compliance audits - We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. In the future, we may be subjected to compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, a deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2017, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $290.6 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2017, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $261.9 million.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, our Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segment each constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. Reporting units are defined by how our President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350 ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."" A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and possibly record impairment charges in a future period.24In accordance with FASB ASC 350, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment (""quantitative assessment""), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No. 2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. On August 1, 2017 (the first day of our fiscal 2018), we performed our annual quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 17.8% and 52.9%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment. It is possible that, during fiscal 2018 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state, our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate or our common stock price could decline. A significant decline in our customers' spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform an interim quantitative assessment during fiscal 2018 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods or our common stock price significantly declines from current levels, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing the quantitative assessment and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2018 (the start of our fiscal 2019). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods.In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. We believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2017. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operation and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a systems failure or security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third party data center facilities, servers and related systems.Similar to all companies in our industry, we are under constant risk of security breaches and other significant attacks on and disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, including third party data center facilities, whether through actual breaches, cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Actual security breaches or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased in recent years and have become more complex. Our IT network and systems, as well as third party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. We may incur significant costs to prevent and respond to actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other systems disruptions.25As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of 911 systems, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from actual breaches, cyber-attacks and other threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that actual security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because security breaches,  particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions have occurred and will occur again in the future. Techniques used in such breaches and cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and actual breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We also may be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damages caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.26Our U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 and 2016 remain subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audits. In addition, TCS's federal income tax returns for calendar years 2013 through 2015 and the tax period from January 1, 2016 to February 23, 2016 are subject to potential future IRS audits. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state and local tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue and the City of Seattle. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns (including the recent audit of fiscal 2014) were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operation and financial condition. We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.  For example, our 911, hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events.  Although all of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line.  Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.27We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC.  We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operation, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (“IP”) based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.28•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.Regulation of the mobile industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and we face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules related to mobile-location based services - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information for the purpose of continued improvement of the overall mobile subscriber experience. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers, so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.29All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.  The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a onetime fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a onetime fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.30Our business is highly competitive, we are reliant upon the success of our partners, and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides Safety and Security Technologies to various state and local municipalities and to a large extent, we are reliant on the success of our wireless partners and distributors to meet our growth objectives. In some cases, our wireless partners may have different objectives or our distributors may not be successful. For example, in February 2016, AT&T, one of our largest partners publicly announced a new nationwide service that is focused on the adoption of NG911 services and that such new service will be deployed in collaboration with a competitor.  In fiscal 2018, we were informed by two of our large distributors that they did not win two large programs which included our NG911 solutions and that AT&T was awarded both programs. Going forward, we intend to continue to work with our partners and expand our direct and indirect sales and distribution channel in this area. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to achieve our long-term business goals.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.31Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. We acquired TCS on February 23, 2016 and have integrated TCS into our existing internal controls over financial reporting. We continue to make changes and related enhancements to the TCS controls as part of our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.  Although we do not expect to experience significant changes in internal control over financial reporting, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and incur additional costs in the future.•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09 which modified certain aspects of ASC 718, including the requirement to recognize  excess tax benefits and shortfalls in the income statement. The ongoing application of this standard will have a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We must adopt new complex revenue recognition rules - The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. The FASB has recently issued new guidance for revenue recognition. The new guidance replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety. We have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the impact that this guidance will have on our business, results of operation and financial condition. This evaluation and the implementation must be completed by August 1, 2018 (our first quarter of fiscal 2019). Due to the complexity of the new standard and our organizational structure, we may not be able to complete such timely. Regardless of the transition method, the application of this new guidance may result in certain adjustments to our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. Because of the uncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with our accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements.32•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as ""XBRL"") in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). In April 2016, as part of its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, the SEC published a concept release which considers various business and financial disclosures that public companies make in investor reports and seeks the public’s input on ways to further improve that disclosure. The issues raised by the SEC in the concept release have the potential to dramatically change the way in which companies prepare and deliver disclosure to investors and the burdens of preparing that disclosure. In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure, supply chain verification and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. A portion of our backlog is determined based on contracts received from our customers (such as the U.S. government and large telephone companies) and in certain cases, is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements.  There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised not being exercised.A significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with safety and security solutions.  Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.33We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel. Many of our key technical management personnel would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.34We rely upon various third party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third-party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.  We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest.  If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially.•Third party data centers or third party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and enterprise technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third-party data centers we use. Our hosted data centers are currently located in third party facilities located in the Irvine and San Francisco, California areas, and we may use others as required. We also use third party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third-party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location-based services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We rely upon “open-source” software - We have incorporated some types of open-source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open-source software. However, as the use of open-source software becomes more widespread, certain open-source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.Indemnification provisions in our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims.  Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. 35In some cases, we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents and due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.For example, we have accrued certain costs related to Vehicle IP, LLC (""Vehicle IP"") which filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court""). TCS is defending our customer.   Substantive settlement conversations have occurred but, to date, the parties have been unable to reach a settlement. For additional information, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings, Other Matters and Final Settlements"" included in ""Part II - Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Company's assessments related to indemnification provisions are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including product liability claims, relating to our software, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. In many cases, we are unable to obtain insurance and are self-insured. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.    Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.Software products, such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers and we must satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. Our 911 call handling software product is a small product line, developed by TCS more than ten years ago and older versions of this software remain deployed by certain end-customers. In August 2016, AT&T, a distributor of this small TCS product line informed us that they do not believe we met certain contractual specifications related to performance and usability and has requested a refund of certain payments made by them.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2017 includes an estimate of our warranty liability associated with this issue which was determined based on a review of contractual obligations, settlement discussions with AT&T and estimates of costs to enhance the software.  We believe our customer support plan, which includes an intention to continue to support end-customers in exchange for an annual customer support fee, has mitigated the negative reputational impact of this issue. In fiscal 2017, we generated approximately $5.5 million of such fees, of which a significant portion was derived from our relationship with AT&T.  Sales in fiscal 2018 for this product line are expected to be similar to what we achieved in fiscal 2017. Although we expect to resolve this issue amicably with AT&T, we may not be able to do so. Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors. We must quickly develop new products and product enhancements to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets in which we operate.36Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third-party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.37From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential future business combinations among wireless network operators could result in a loss of revenue for our business.    We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. To date, a relatively small number of end users have subscribed for our services in connection with their wireless plans compared to the total number of mobile phone users. Our future growth depends heavily on achieving significantly increased subscriber adoption of the wireless communication solutions we sell either through standalone subscriptions to our solutions or as part of bundles from our existing wireless carrier partners. Our success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of our solutions by attracting and retaining additional wireless carrier partners. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services including in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties. If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as AT&T, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Although we have a long history of providing services to many of our wireless carrier partners, from time to time, we routinely perform services without a multi-period contract while we negotiate new and extended contract terms and pricing. These negotiations are complex and may take long periods of time. Ultimately, if we are not successful in obtaining multi-period contract terms, or even a new contract, our revenues could be suddenly and materially reduced.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer these location-based services to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The telecommunications industry generally is currently undergoing a consolidation phase. Many of our customers, specifically wireless carrier customers of our Commercial Solutions segment, have or may become the target of acquisitions. If the number of our customers is significantly reduced as a result of this consolidation trend, or if the resulting companies do not utilize our product offerings, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.38Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•our ability to successfully integrate TCS and manage our combined company;•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In the future we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute a stockholder's ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.39A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.We have paid quarterly dividends every quarter since September 2010. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Secured Credit Facility, as amended. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under the Company's Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
3,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2016-10-06,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.Risks Related to our BusinessOur fiscal 2017 business outlook, which now includes our assumptions related to the TCS business, is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.Our new orders, net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results from period to period. A large portion of our Commercial Solutions segment net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and certain traveling wave tube amplifier products that generally have short lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. A large portion of our Government Solutions segment net sales are derived in part from large U.S. Government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and are therefore difficult to predict.On February 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TCS. Pursuant to accounting rules, the acquisition of TCS is expected to result in a material increase in annual amortization expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 related to intangibles and possible other fair value adjustments. We have completed a preliminary analysis of such amortization expense but have not yet finalized our analysis of these fair value adjustments. Additionally, our ability to accurately forecast future performance will be dependent upon our ability to fully familiarize ourselves with the variability of the business and environment in which TCS operates. Our fiscal 2016 operating results were and our fiscal 2017 operating results, to a lesser extent, are expected to be impacted by approximately $48.0 million of expenditures relating to the acquisition of TCS. Additional unanticipated acquisition-related costs may be incurred. The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate and volatile political conditions have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.For the past several years, many of the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that are undergoing sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world have also cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them. In recent years global oil and natural gas prices plunged, significantly impairing the ability of our customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many international currencies, resulting in lower purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. Political conditions around the world are unstable and current and potential future economic sanctions could be imposed on some of our end-customers which could adversely impact our sales. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it remains possible that another worldwide credit crisis or recession could occur.18We believe that the aggregation of adverse global economic conditions has resulted in the ongoing suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. We believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of interest rates may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union and the U.K.’s future relationships with European Union member states. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.Our overall business has not been immune from these adverse conditions and we face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.•Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - Our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our reporting operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build-outs from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of TCS and related merger and integration activity may divert our resources and management attention.The acquisition of TCS has a number of unique risks, including:•We may not be able to manage organizational changes associated with the TCS acquisition - As of February 1, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of TCS, we reorganized our business into two reporting operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. We may further change our business and organizational structure and streamline and further consolidate certain business processes to achieve greater operating efficiencies.  We will face operational and administrative challenges as we work to integrate TCS's operations into our business. In particular, the acquisition of TCS has significantly expanded the types of products and services that we sell, expanded the businesses in which we engage, and increased the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in scale of our business. These challenges include the integration of a large number of systems, both operational and administrative. We may not be able to successfully manage these organizational changes and the unanticipated disruption to our business that might result from these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the diversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.19•We may not realize the benefits of merger integration costs - Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the acquisition of TCS, we cannot provide assurance that such benefits will be achieved at all or, if achieved, to what extent. In particular, the success of the acquisition of TCS depends, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated efficiencies and cost savings, primarily through the elimination of redundant functions and the integration of certain operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings within the anticipated time frame, or at all.•We may experience a loss or adverse effect on customer relationships - The acquisition of TCS may adversely affect the relationships that the combined company has with its customers, service providers and employees. As a result of the acquisition, we may experience a loss of, or changes to, TCS’s relationships with its customers or Comtech’s legacy customers, which could negatively impact our business outlook.  Our future growth depends in part on expanding relationships with key distribution channels for TCS products such as Next Generation 911 solutions. If we are unable to capitalize on those relationships or if we lose existing relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain personnel could adversely affect our future business, operations and financial results.Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. If we are unable to do so, our business could be harmed. We have incurred substantial indebtedness under a Secured Credit Facility, and may not be able in the future to service that debt.In connection with the acquisition of TCS, we entered into a Secured Credit Facility which provides for borrowing availability of up to $400.0 million. As of July 31, 2016, we had approximately $256.5 million of borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility of which $172.6 million is from a $250.0 million Term Loan A and $83.9 million of drawings under a revolving credit line. The Secured Credit Facility requires interim payments and payment in full by February 23, 2021. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. If we are unable to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses, as we have pledged substantially all of our assets to the lenders as security for our payment obligations.Our Secured Credit Facility contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and, as a result, reduce our profitability.Our Secured Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. In addition, the agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios such as a maximum net leverage ratio of 2.75x Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility) by the end of our fiscal 2017.  Even if we achieve expected financial results in fiscal 2017, it is possible that we may not be able to meet such covenants.  Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.Our substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;•if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;•we may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;•we may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;20•we may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.Future acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.We expect to continue to consider future acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:•properly evaluate the technology;•accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;•integrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;•integrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;•retain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and•combine potentially different corporate cultures.Acquisitions and investments could also:•divert management’s attention away from the operation of our businesses;•result in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and•increase expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government’s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $167.5 million, $94.0 million and $97.3 million or 40.8%, 30.6% and 28.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Following the TCS acquisition, we expect that our sales to the U.S. government will increase as a percentage of total sales. A large portion of our existing backlog consisted of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our business outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond depends, in part, on new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budgetary pressures.We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our backlog depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress’s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress’s actions to delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.21The impact of a legislation process known as sequestration (or mandated reductions) remains a significant risk. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. A two-year budget agreement set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 lessened the across-the-board cuts of sequestration; however, sequestration continues to be in effect, including for the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. Sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate and we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts.The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present.Ultimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact our Government Solutions segment. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks.We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues.  Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years.  Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.In addition, we could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government.  As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information.  Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts.  If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.22Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits that could result in penalties and a reduction in contract value.All of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (""DCAA"") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or ""TINA"" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 30.0%, 56.2% and 59.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:•We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes. It is possible, that the strength in the U.S. dollar will continue or that it will further increase against many international currencies. If this occurs, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.23Our international sales and operations are subject to risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses, and such failure would materially adversely affect our operations.We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries.  Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported.  In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected.U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (""OFAC""). In addition, we are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we have conducted virtually no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the DDTC and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. In October 2014, we self-disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a routine assessment of the adequacy of our export control compliance procedures that we had inadvertently neglected to obtain an OFAC license for a shipment of modems to a Canadian customer who, we learned after the transaction had begun, intended to incorporate our modems in a communication system the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority.  OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly in Sudan and from facilitating transactions by non-U.S. persons which would be illegal if done by a U.S. person.  In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena to us seeking further information about the previously voluntarily disclosed transaction and any other transactions involving Sudan. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon after which time the modems were rerouted to Sudan without Comtech’s knowledge.  OFAC has not responded to our submission of further information and we cannot predict when the agency will complete its review and determine whether any violations occurred. While OFAC could decide not to impose penalties and only issue a no action or cautionary letter, we could face civil and criminal penalties and may suffer reputational harm if we are found to have violated U.S. sanctions laws. Even though we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanctions targets, any such measures, or any new measures we may implement in the future, may be ineffective. As a result, there is risk that in the future we could provide our products to or permit our products to be downloaded or accessed by such targets despite these precautions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.  We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. In the future, we may be subjected to compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.24Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.As of July 31, 2016, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $287.6 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2016, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $284.7 million. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the required Step One test as described in FASB ASC 350, we would do a Step Two test which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.It is possible that, during future financial periods, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state and our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing Step One of the goodwill impairment test and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, both the Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of each respective reporting unit. Reporting units are defined by how our President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by FASB ASC 350. A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and ultimately record impairment charges in a future period.On August 1, 2016 (the first day of our fiscal 2017), we performed our annual quantitative assessment (commonly referred to as a Step One test) and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approach. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 11.8% and 40.5%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired.  If we had not utilized the market approach, our Commercial Solutions reporting unit's goodwill would be at risk of impairment.  During interim periods, if our expected financial results materially decline below our initial expectations or if other events and circumstances change which indicate the potential for impairment (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record interim impairment charges when we perform and fail an interim test or in other future periods. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2017 (the start of our fiscal 2018). In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. No events were identified during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. As such, we believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2016. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a systems failure or security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third party data center facilities, servers and related systems.We face the risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems, including third party data center facilities, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT network and systems, as well as third party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. We may incur significant costs to prevent such systems disruptions.25As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of 911 systems, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer’s IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:     •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; and•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.We take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We also may be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damages caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user’s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.26Our U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has recently audited our federal income tax return for fiscal 2014 and our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2013 and 2015 remain subject to potential future IRS audits. In addition, TCS's federal income tax returns for calendar year 2013 through 2015 are subject to potential future IRS audit.  In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state and local tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue and the City of Seattle. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns (including the audit of fiscal 2014) were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.  For example, our 911, hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events.  Although all of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.We design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line.  Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.We cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.27We may be subject to environmental liabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.Many of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:•We must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC.  We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.•We are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operation, and financial condition.•Our future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (“IP”) based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.28•Under the FCC’s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC’s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government’s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers’ obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.Regulation of the mobile industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.As the mobile industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and face certain risks including:•We must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules related to mobile-location based services - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information, could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information for the purpose of continued improvement of the overall mobile subscriber experience. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber’s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier’s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers’ permission to gather and use the subscribers’ personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.•The regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing -     The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.29All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (""MF-TDMA"") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.  The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.Our Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier’s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a onetime fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a onetime fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.Our expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.30Our business is highly competitive and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.Our business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Several of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.31Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. In fiscal 2016, we transitioned from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") 1992 Internal Control - Integrated Framework to the COSO 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. In accordance with the rules and regulations related to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are taking a one-year exemption related to the controls of TCS. We have begun the process of implementing new controls related to TCS, and in the future, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and incur additional costs. •Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 718, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The ongoing application of this standard has had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We must adopt new complex revenue recognition rules - The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. The FASB has recently issued new guidance for revenue recognition. The new guidance replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety. Given the impact of our recent acquisition of TCS on February 23, 2016, we have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the impact that this guidance will have on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Regardless of the transition method, the application of this new guidance may result in certain adjustments to our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. Because of the uncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with our accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements.32•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as ""XBRL"") in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). In April 2016, as part of its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, the SEC published a concept release which considers various business and financial disclosures that public companies make in investor reports and seeks the public’s input on ways to further improve that disclosure. The issues raised by the SEC in the concept release have the potential to dramatically change the way in which companies prepare and deliver disclosure to investors and the burdens of preparing that disclosure. In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure, supply chain verification and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. A portion of our backlog is determined based on contracts received from our customers (such as the U.S. government and large telephone companies) and in certain cases, is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements.  There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised not being exercised.We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.33We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel. Many of our key technical management personnel would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.•We may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.34We rely upon various third party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.Risks from our reliance with these third parties include:•The loss of mapping and third party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others.  Any disruption of this third party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.  We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest.  If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially.•Third party data centers or third party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and enterprise technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third party data centers we use. Our hosted data centers are currently located in third party facilities located in the Irvine and San Francisco, California areas, and we may use others as required. We also use third party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers’ ability to receive information.•We must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location-based services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.•We rely upon “open-source” software - We have incorporated some types of open source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open source software. However, as the use of open source software becomes more widespread, certain open source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.35TCS is a party to lawsuits and other disputes related to intellectual property and contract obligations. The resolutions of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims.  Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents and due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation.  It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.TCS is currently a party to a number of legal proceedings, including lawsuits relating to customers seeking indemnification under contractual arrangements for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, including in combination with products and services of other vendors. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2016 includes a $28.1 million liability, which represents the preliminary estimated fair value for pre-acquisition contingencies related to certain intellectual property legal proceedings and contractual obligations that existed as of the date of acquisition. These preliminary estimated fair values reflect market participant assumptions, as required by FASB ASC 805 ""Business Combinations,"" and do not reflect our settlement position or amounts we actually may pay if an unfavorable resolution occurs.  For additional information, see ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters"" included in ""Part II-Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Company's assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.We are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including patent infringement and product liability claims, relating to our software, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to infringement of third party intellectual property rights, defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.    Because our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.     Products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.Software products such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers and satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. In August 2016, AT&T, a distributor of a small TCS product line that we refer to as our 911 call handling software solution, informed us that they do not believe we met certain contractual specifications related to performance and usability and has requested a refund of certain payments made by them. In addition, AT&T has requested that we make certain changes to our 911 call handling software and provide those enhancements to them at no additional cost.  36Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2016 includes a $7.2 million liability, reflecting the preliminary estimated fair value of this contingent liability, as required by FASB ASC 805 ""Business Combinations."" The estimated fair value was based on a review of contractual obligations and estimates of costs to enhance the software. We do not anticipate deploying additional 911 call handling software solutions sold through AT&T until this issue is resolved. In fiscal 2016, we sold an aggregate of approximately $4.5 million of 911 call handling software solutions, a majority of which was derived from our relationship with AT&T. Sales in our fiscal 2017 for this product line are expected to be similar to what we achieved in fiscal 2016. Although we expect to resolve this issue amicably with AT&T, we may not be able to so.Our hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors. We must quickly develop new products and product enhancements to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets in which we operate.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of these applications.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.Pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.37From time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers’ incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition.If our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential future business combinations among wireless network operators could result in a loss of revenue for our business.    We generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. To date, a relatively small number of end users have subscribed for our services in connection with their wireless plans compared to the total number of mobile phone users. Our future growth depends heavily on achieving significantly increased subscriber adoption of the wireless communication solutions we sell either through standalone subscriptions to our solutions or as part of bundles from our existing wireless carrier partners. Our success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of our solutions by attracting and retaining additional wireless carrier partners. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.Poor performance in or disruptions of the services including in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties. If we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as AT&T, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.Competitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer these location-based services to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.The telecommunications industry generally is currently undergoing a consolidation phase. Many of our customers, specifically wireless carrier customers of our Commercial Solutions segment, have or may become the target of acquisitions. If the number of our customers is significantly reduced as a result of this consolidation trend, or if the resulting companies do not utilize our product offerings, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.38Risks Related to our Common StockOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:•our ability to successfully integrate TCS and manage our combined company;•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Future issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute your ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.In the future we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.39A ""business combination"" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.A disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount established by our Board of Directors. The current annual targeted dividend for fiscal 2017 is $1.20 per common share.Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Secured Credit Facility. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors began further assessing our capital needs generally and the appropriate level of future dividends. Future dividends also remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under the Company's Secured Credit Facility as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.Additionally, our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Secured Credit Facility and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future"
17,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2015-09-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate and volatile political conditions have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition.We participate in the global advanced communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past several years, the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that are undergoing sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world have also cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them. In our fiscal 2015, global oil prices and natural gas prices plunged, significantly impairing the ability of our customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies, resulting in lower purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. Political conditions around the world are unstable and current and potential future economic sanctions could be imposed on some of our end-customers which could adversely impact our sales. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it remains possible that another worldwide credit crisis or recession could occur. We believe that the aggregation of adverse global economic conditions has resulted in the ongoing suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. We believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. If interest rates remain low or turn negative, our customers may become reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment. In addition, if worldwide interest rates rise, it is possible that new projects to install or upgrade telecommunications networks that are currently being contemplated by our customers, particularly in emerging markets which generally receive financing from European banks and/or financial assistance from various governments, will be postponed or canceled.None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. •Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.19•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build outs from large European commercial banks and/or government financial assistance. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.We may not be able to successfully manage recently initiated organizational changes and potential organizational changes that we may make in the future.In fiscal 2015, after considering various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a possible merger or sale of the Company, our Board of Directors (“Board”) determined that the interests of the Company and its shareholders would best be served by the Company remaining independent. Shortly thereafter, our Board named a new President and CEO to succeed our former President and CEO who now serves as Executive Chairman of the Board.Our new President and CEO is currently assessing our operations to determine if changes to our business approach or operations would help us better serve our customers and potentially reduce our annual operating expenses. To date, this assessment has resulted in, among other things: (i) the formation of a joint venture consisting solely of our domestic operating subsidiaries to enhance internal collaboration and allow us to propose on new opportunities with a unified approach; (ii) the expansion of our corporate marketing and business development function to enhance our focus on existing and untapped market opportunities; and (iii) organizational changes including the planned integration of the activities and business of our mobile satellite transceiver product line with our satellite earth station product line. As our President and CEO’s assessment is continuing, we may further change our business and organizational structure and streamline and further consolidate certain business processes to achieve greater operating efficiencies. We may not be able to successfully manage these organizational changes and the unanticipated disruption to our business that might result from these changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our fiscal 2016 business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast as operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and certain traveling wave tube amplifier products respectively, that generally have short lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.20Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations.As we enter fiscal 2016, we are embarking on a focused acquisition plan to expand our global footprint and further diversify our product lines which we believe will position us for long-term revenue growth and build long-term value for our shareholders. Future acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.The future business of our mobile data communications segment is highly dependent on the decisions of its principal customer, the U.S. Army, and we may not be able to maintain our current levels of operating income in future years.Our mobile data communications segment's net sales and operating income through March 2017 is expected to be derived from BFT-1 sustainment services that we provide to the U.S. Army pursuant to two existing contracts. The first contract allows us to provide engineering services and satellite network operations on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis and program management services on a firm-fixed-price basis. The second contract is in the form of a BFT-1 intellectual property license agreement that calls for $10.0 million of annual license fees. During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Army exercised its first twelve-month option for both contracts with a performance period that began April 1, 2015 and expires March 31, 2016 with one remaining twelve-month option period exercisable by the U.S. Army. If the U.S. Army exercises the remaining twelve-month option period and pays the related $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, which covers the period April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, the U.S. Army will receive a limited non-exclusive right to use our BFT-1 intellectual property after March 31, 2017 for no additional license fee. Given current U.S. government budget pressures and the unknown timing of the U.S. Army's roll-out of the next generation BFT system, it is possible that the U.S. Army will not fund any additional amounts or exercise the twelve-month option period on one or both of our contracts and we may not generate any additional net sales or operating income associated with BFT-1 sustainment services (including the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee) beyond March 31, 2016. If the U.S. Army does not exercise its option to renew the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, it would have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2016 business outlook and our future business results of operations. Even if the U.S. Army exercises the twelve-month option period for the intellectual property license agreement, no further extensions, renewals or replacements of that agreement will occur as the U.S. Army will be entitled to use our BFT-1 intellectual property for no additional fee. If we are ultimately unable to significantly increase sales of our current products, develop and sell new products or services, win new programs or replace the operating income contribution of the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, our mobile data communications segment may not be able to generate any meaningful operating income beyond March 31, 2017. Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities that reduce the U.S. Department of Defense budget and the U.S. government's debt could have a material adverse effect on us, including negatively impacting our fiscal 2016 business outlook. During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $94.0 million, $97.3 million and $110.9 million or 30.6%, 28.0% and 34.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Approximately 45.4% of our backlog at July 31, 2015 consisted of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our business outlook for fiscal 2016 and beyond depends, in part, on receiving new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budget pressures.21Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and failure of Congress to appropriate funds, delay it's spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, certain assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.  The impact of a legislation process known as sequestration (or mandated reductions) remains a significant risk. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (""Budget Control Act"") provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. A two-year budget agreement set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 lessened the across-the-board cuts of sequestration; however, sequestration continues to be in effect, including for the U.S. Department of Defense. Sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate and we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts. It is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, other government programs and it remains difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for many of the programs in which we participate and our assessment may prove to be incorrect. Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the United States' debt ceiling on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present. We believe that despite budget pressures, spending on the modernization and maintenance of advanced communications systems that include our products and services will continue to be a national priority. Future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems, along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing systems and provide real-time integration of surveillance, information management, strike and battle management platforms. Our products and services are used in various programs involving command and control, network communications, enhanced situational awareness, satellite systems and restricted programs as well as numerous international and homeland security programs. Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long-term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. We continue to see long sales cycles and order delays from the U.S. government and it is possible that these long sales cycles and delays will continue for a prolonged period. Ultimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience further delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2016 business and financial outlook, our operating results and our financial condition.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.22All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audit by various agencies and the outcome of audits is difficult to predict. All of our U.S. government contracts, such as our Advanced Time Division Multiple Access (""TDMA"") Interface Processor (""ATIP"") contract with the U.S. Navy with a potential value of $40.2 million, can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or “TINA” audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 56.2%, 59.4% and 50.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: •We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.23•We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.•We currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. Dollars – Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes. It is possible, that the strength in the U.S. dollar will continue or that it will further increase against many international currencies. If this occurs, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of August 1, 2015, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $137.4 million (of which $107.8 million relates to our telecommunications transmission segment and $29.6 million relates to our RF microwave amplifiers segment). Additionally, as of August 1, 2015, intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $20.0 million (of which $10.7 million relates to our telecommunications transmission segment and $9.3 million relates to our RF microwave amplifiers segment). Our mobile data communications segment has no goodwill or intangible assets. Each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions in determining their estimated fair values. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail Step One, we would do a Step Two test which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.On August 1, 2015 (the first day of our fiscal 2016), we performed a quantitative assessment (commonly referred to as a Step One test) using market participant assumptions to determine if the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value. In making this assessment, we considered, among other things, expectations of projected net sales and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in trading multiples of comparable companies, changes in our stock price and changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill. We also considered overall business and macroeconomic conditions since our last annual assessment on August 1, 2014 (the first day of our fiscal 2015) including, among other things, the fact that the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that continue to undergo sweeping economic and political changes. The U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies which has caused many of our international end-customers to have lower purchasing power for our products since the U.S. dollar is the currency in which virtually all of our sales are denominated. Global oil and natural gas prices have materially declined which has negatively impacted our energy dependent customers including Russia and Brazil. China is experiencing slower economic growth and has devalued its currency. Our U.S. government customers continue to experience budget pressures and it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, government programs we participate in. In response to these challenging conditions, many of our customers have cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them which has significantly impaired their ability to invest in advanced communication products and infrastructure. We believe that many, if not all of these conditions are temporary and will improve over time. Nevertheless, for purposes of conducting our impairment analysis including determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilized net sales and cash flow projections that are below our actual expectations. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and we did not perform a Step Two assessment.24It is possible that, during fiscal 2016 or beyond, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state and our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. A significant decline in defense spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform an interim Step One goodwill impairment test during fiscal 2016 or beyond. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods, our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers reporting units could be at risk of failing Step One of the goodwill impairment test and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired.In addition to risks associated with business conditions and our net sales and cash flow projections, our goodwill may be impaired during interim periods during fiscal 2016 or beyond if we change our reporting structure. For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of each respective reporting unit. Reporting units are defined by how our President and CEO and our Executive Chairman currently manage the business. Our President and CEO is currently assessing our operations to determine if changes to our business approach or operations would help us better serve our customers and potentially reduce our annual operating expenses. To-date, this assessment has resulted in: (i) the formation of a joint venture consisting solely of our domestic operating subsidiaries to enhance internal collaboration and allow us to propose on new opportunities with a unified approach; (ii) the expansion of our corporate marketing and business development function to enhance our focus on existing and untapped market opportunities; and (iii) organizational changes, including the planned integration of the activities and business of our mobile satellite transceiver product line with our satellite earth station product line. We are also pursuing a focused acquisition plan to expand our global footprint and further diversify our product lines. As such, we may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by FASB ASC 350. A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and ultimately record impairment charges in a future period.In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2016 (the start of our fiscal 2017). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. In addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. No events were identified during fiscal year ended July 31, 2015. As such, we believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2015. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain customers.We face the risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. Our customers' systems, our IT networks and/or systems and certain of our equipment are under frequent attack.25As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could: •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and •Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally. In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with certain international, as well as domestic, laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: •We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 26The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.•Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business.•We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2012 through 2014 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audits. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.Many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized.  Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.  27Our expected growth and maintaining our strong financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. In fiscal 2016, we anticipate transitioning from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") 1992 Internal Control - Integrated Framework to the COSO 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Although we do not expect to experience significant changes in internal control over financial reporting as a result of our transition, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and incur additional costs in the future.•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The ongoing application of this standard has had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.28•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure, supply chain verification and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have (and may) increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.29Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our telecommunications transmission segment operates our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona which has been utilized, at one time or another, by all three of our business segments and, to a much lesser extent, by third-party commercial customers, including prime contractors to the U.S. government, who have outsourced a portion of their manufacturing to us. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.30We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. •We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.31We could become a party to litigation or subject to claims, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.We are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. In June 2012, subpoenas issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) sought certain documents and records relating to Fred Kornberg who was then our Chief Executive Officer and is currently our Executive Chairman. We believe the subpoenas related to Mr. Kornberg's contacts with a scientific attaché to the Israeli Purchasing Mission in the United States who Mr. Kornberg met in connection with the sale of our equipment to the State of Israel during the 1980's. This scientific attaché was later alleged to have conducted intelligence operations in the U.S. Separately, in connection with an investigation by the SEC into trading in securities of CPI International, Inc. (“CPI”), in March and April 2012, we and Mr. Kornberg received subpoenas from the SEC for documents concerning transactions in CPI stock by Mr. Kornberg and other persons (including one subsidiary employee). Mr. Kornberg purchased CPI stock in November 2010 which was after the September 2010 termination of our May 2010 agreement to acquire CPI. The independent members of our Board of Directors have monitored these matters with the assistance of independent counsel and we and Mr. Kornberg have cooperated with the U.S. government regarding both matters. Neither we nor Mr. Kornberg have been contacted by the government with respect to either matter since 2012.The costs incurred by the Company in responding to subpoenas, cooperating with investigatory requests, and litigating commercial disputes, and the assessment of damage awards, fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount established by our Board of Directors. The current annual targeted dividend is $1.20 per common share. We have paid quarterly dividends for twenty consecutive quarters and, in fiscal 2015, we paid $19.4 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. If we make an acquisition that requires us to issue debt, our lenders may impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. A disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our investor relations and, in turn, negatively impact our stock price.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.From time to time, we receive correspondence alleging that a product or other part of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently conducted.32If any technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contracts with our President and CEO and our Executive Chairman, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.33Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•issuance of debt;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes related to ongoing military conflicts;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•changes in the status of U.S. government investigations relating to our Executive Chairman;•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock"
4,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2014-10-09,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Our decision to explore strategic alternatives may not result in an action or transaction and may be disruptive to our business operations.In August 2014, we confirmed, in response to media reports, that our Board of Directors is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a possible merger or sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that any transaction or other strategic change will occur as a result of the current exploration of alternatives or that any transaction or strategic change, if completed, will be successful or on attractive terms. In addition, the exploration of strategic alternatives could result in: (i) us incurring expenses without realizing any benefit; (ii) the diversion of management's attention and resources away from our ongoing businesses; (iii) the loss of key employees and engineering talent; and (iv) loss of confidence by current and potential customers in the future of our business, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, business outlook, results of operations and financial condition.The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate and volatile political conditions have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition.We participate in the global commercial and government communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past several years, our customers and the end-markets that we serve have been materially impacted by adverse global economic conditions. These conditions have resulted in: (i) changes to our commercial and government customers’ historical spending priorities, (ii) reduced military budgets, and (iii) extreme pressures on government budgets throughout the world. In addition to operating in a difficult global economic environment, some of our end customers are located in emerging countries that have and continue to undergo sweeping political changes. Political conditions around the world are unstable and current and potential future economic sanctions could be imposed on some of our end-customers (such as Russia) which could adversely impact our sales. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it remains possible that another worldwide credit crisis could occur. We believe that the aggregation of these conditions has resulted in the ongoing suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. Although we achieved revenue growth in fiscal 2014 and expect to continue to grow in fiscal 2015, we believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. As such, the impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. If interest rates remain low or turn negative (as has occurred in some European countries), our customers may become reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment. In addition, if worldwide interest rates increase, it is possible that new projects to install or upgrade telecommunications networks that are currently being contemplated by our customers, particularly in emerging markets which generally receive financing from European banks and/or financial assistance from various governments, will be postponed or canceled.19None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. •Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Although we achieved overall consolidated revenue growth in fiscal 2014, our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build outs from large European commercial banks and/or financial assistance from various governments. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.Our fiscal 2015 business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast, as operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.20Our mobile data communications segment's future business outlook  is dependent on the U.S. Army's funding decisions and the renewal of our BFT-1 contracts and we may not be able to maintain our expected levels of mobile data communications segment revenues in future years.Our mobile data communications segment's revenue and operating income through March 2017 is expected to be largely driven by the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee for our BFT-1 technology. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we are currently providing BFT-1 sustainment support to the U.S. Army pursuant to two three-year contracts aggregating $68.2 million. The first contract has a not to exceed value of $38.2 million under which we provide engineering services and satellite network operations on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis, and program management services on a firm-fixed-price basis and the second contract is in the form of an intellectual property license agreement with a potential value of $30.0 million. Both contracts cover a base period that expires March 31, 2015 with two twelve-month option periods exercisable by the U.S. Army. During fiscal 2014, the U.S. Army funded orders of $17.5 million under these two contracts (including the $10.0 million annual intellectual property license fee for the performance period from April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015) and during the first quarter of our fiscal 2015, the U.S. Army funded an incremental $6.1 million to complete the funding for the base year of these contracts. If the U.S. Army pays an aggregate of $30.0 million of annual intellectual property license fees, the U.S. Army will receive a limited non-exclusive right to use our intellectual property after March 31, 2017 for no additional license fee. Given current U.S. government budget pressures and the unknown timing of the U.S. Army's roll-out of the next generation BFT system, it is possible that the U.S. Army will not fund any additional amounts or exercise the twelve-month option periods on one or both of our contracts and we may not generate any additional revenue or operating income associated with BFT-1 sustainment services (including the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee) beyond March 31, 2015.  Although we expect that our BFT-1 contract will be renewed, extended or replaced, the amount of future operating income associated with BFT-1 sustainment activities may, in the future, be significantly lower. If the U.S. Army does not exercise its option to renew the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, it would have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2015 business outlook, our future business outlook and our future operating results. Even if the U.S. Army exercises the two twelve-month option periods for the intellectual property license agreement, no further extensions, renewals or replacements of that agreement will occur, as the U.S. Army will be entitled to use our intellectual property for no additional fee. We intend to focus future business development activities in our mobile data communications segment on our current BFT-1 customer and certain foreign military organizations. We believe that by seeking to work collaboratively with the U.S. Army to ensure that its short-term and long-term needs are addressed, we will enhance our competitive positioning for potential new awards and programs in the future. In addition, we intend to seek out opportunities to export our commercial line of satellite transceivers to certain countries and expand our business on an appropriate regional basis. We also expect to continue to offer our customers niche products. If we are ultimately unable to significantly increase sales of our current products, develop and sell new products or services, win new programs or replace the operating income contribution of the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, our mobile data communications segment may not be able to generate any meaningful operating income beyond March 31, 2017. Given the various uncertainties related to our BFT-1 sustainment activities and the success of our future business development activities, our operating results in fiscal 2015 and beyond could be more volatile and it could be more difficult in the future to accurately project consolidated gross margins, operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period.Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities that reduce the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) budget and the U.S. government's debt could have a material adverse effect on us including negatively impacting our fiscal 2015 business outlook. During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $97.3 million, $110.9 million and $207.8 million or 28.0%, 34.7% and 48.9%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Approximately 25.0% of our backlog at July 31, 2014 consisted of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2015 and beyond depends, in part, on receiving new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budget pressures.Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and failure of Congress to appropriate funds, delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, certain assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.  21The impact of a legislation process known as sequestration (or mandated reductions) remains a significant risk. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. A two-year budget agreement set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 lessened the across-the-board cuts of sequestration; however, sequestration continues to be in effect, including for the U.S. Department of Defense. The two-year budget agreement reduced the $52.0 billion of cuts in expenditures that the U.S. Department of Defense was required to make in 2014 by $21.0 billion, which translates to a 1.2% reduction compared to 2013, as compared to the originally required 6% reduction. Planned cuts in expenditures for 2015 were reduced by $10.0 billion. Although there is a general sense that defense spending levels are stabilizing, the U.S. government’s budget for fiscal 2015 has not yet been approved, it continues to be hotly debated, and sequestration may ultimately occur. Sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate and we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts. In addition, it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, other government programs and it remains difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for many of the programs in which we participate and our assessment may prove to be incorrect.The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the United States' debt ceiling on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present. We believe that despite budget pressures, spending on the modernization and maintenance of advanced communications systems that include our products and services will continue to be a national priority. Future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems, along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing systems and provide real-time integration of surveillance, information management, strike and battle management platforms. Our products and services are used in various programs involving command and control, network communications, enhanced situational awareness, satellite systems and restricted programs as well as numerous international and homeland security programs. Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long-term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. We continue to see long sales cycles and order delays from the U.S. government and it is possible that these long sales cycles and delays will continue for a prolonged period. Ultimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience further delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2015 business and financial outlook, our operating results and our financial condition.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.22All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audit by various agencies and the outcome of audits is difficult to predict. All of our U.S. government contracts, such as our Advanced Time Division Multiple Access (""TDMA"") Interface Processor (""ATIP"") contract with the U.S. Navy with a potential value of $29.8 million, can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or “TINA” audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in May 2011, we were notified that our original BFT-1 contract, which was awarded to us on August 31, 2007 (our fiscal 2008), was selected for a post-award audit by the DCAA. We received total funded orders against this contract, which expired December 31, 2011, of $376.3 million. A post-award audit, or TINA audit, generally focuses on whether the contractor disclosed current, accurate and complete cost or pricing data in the contract negotiation process pursuant to TINA and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”). We fully cooperated with the DCAA and Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”) and provided them information that supported our view that the August 2007 BFT-1 contract was subject to a Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS"") and TINA exemption for fixed price commercial contract line items (such as our mobile satellite transceivers and other hardware), as defined by the FAR. In May 2013, we were informed that the DCAA recommended a price adjustment of $11.8 million (plus interest); however, in March 2014, we were notified by a Branch Chief and Contracting Officer that the U.S. Army reviewed the information we provided as well as information provided by DCAA, federal regulations, and contract file documentation and came to the conclusion that the cost or pricing data provided was not deemed to be defective. Nevertheless, the Contracting Officer requested we provide the U.S. government a voluntary refund equal to the DCAA's recommended price adjustment because the U.S. Army believes that certain costs we provided during negotiations were overstated. In May 2014, we notified the Contracting Officer that we disagreed with the Contracting Officer’s assertion that the cost data provided was in any way overstated, and we respectfully declined to provide a voluntary refund. Although we consider the matter closed, it is possible that the U.S. Army may pursue a claim, and we could be required to refund monies to the U.S. government, with interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, future audits on other contracts may result in proposed adjustments that ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations and financial condition. 23The outcome of U.S. government investigations are difficult to predict. In June 2012, certain officers and employees of the Company received subpoenas issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) seeking certain documents and records relating to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Although the EDNY subpoenas made no specific allegations, we believe the subpoenas related to a grand jury investigation stemming from our CEO's contacts with a scientific attaché to the Israeli Purchasing Mission in the United States who our CEO met in connection with the sale of our equipment to the State of Israel during the 1980's. This scientific attaché was later alleged to have conducted intelligence operations in the U.S. In August 2012, we were informed by the U.S. government that our CEO's security clearance was suspended. In order to maintain our qualification for government contracts requiring facility security clearance, at that time, we made certain internal organizational realignments that have remained in place. Those changes restrict access to classified information to other Comtech senior executives, management and other employees who maintain the required level of clearance. Separately, in connection with an investigation by the SEC into trading in securities of CPI International, Inc. (“CPI”), we and our CEO, among others, received subpoenas in 2012 from the SEC for documents concerning transactions in CPI stock by our CEO and other persons (including one subsidiary employee). Our CEO purchased CPI stock in November 2010, after the September 2010 termination of our May 2010 agreement to acquire CPI. The independent members of our Board of Directors have monitored these matters with the assistance of independent counsel.We and our CEO cooperated with the U.S. government regarding the above matters and neither he nor the Company has been contacted by the U.S. government with respect to either matter since September 2012. Although the status or outcome of any government investigation is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to predict, based on our work in respect of the subpoenas in each matter, we do not believe that it is likely that either matter will result in a legal proceeding against our CEO or the Company. If either matter were to result in a legal proceeding, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 59.4%, 50.1% and 38.7% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: •We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.•We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.24Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2014, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $163.6 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $122.1 million and $41.5 million relates to our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments, respectively.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. On August 1, 2014 (the first day of our fiscal 2015), pursuant to the accounting standards update, we performed a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as a ""Step 0"" test) to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value. In making this assessment, we evaluated overall business and overall macroeconomic conditions since the date of our last quantitative assessment, which was on August 1, 2013. We considered in our qualitative assessment, among other things, expectations of projected revenues and cash flows, assumptions impacting the weighted average cost of capital, trends in market multiples, changes in our stock price, changes in the carrying values of our reporting units with goodwill, and overall global industry and market conditions. Based upon this evaluation, we concluded that our goodwill was not likely impaired and we did not perform a quantitative Step One assessment. In the future, we will either perform a qualitative Step 0 assessment or a quantitative Step One assessment. A quantitative Step One assessment involves determining the fair value of each reporting unit using market participant assumptions.  If we believe that the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, we will perform a quantitative Step Two impairment assessment. Step Two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. The annual goodwill impairment assessment is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting unit structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods.  If assumed revenue growth is not achieved in future periods, our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers reporting units could be at risk of failing Step One of the goodwill impairment test and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be written off. It is possible that, during fiscal 2015, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state and our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. A significant decline in defense spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a Step One interim goodwill impairment test during fiscal 2015. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2015 (the start of our fiscal 2016). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain customers.We face the risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. Our customers' systems and certain of our equipment are under frequent attack.25As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could: •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and •Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally. In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with certain international, as well as domestic, laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: •We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 26The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.•Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business.•We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2011 through 2013 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audits. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 27Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology. Although competition for customers who will benefit from deployment of such technology has increased, we have a large installed base of customers who require backward compatibility and we have and continue to integrate this technology into a number of our satellite earth station products. Ultimately, we believe that demand for this product will increase from current levels.A significant technological or sales breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or an unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. Since fiscal 2006, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure, supply chain verification and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.28Our costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have (and may) increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our telecommunications transmission segment operates our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona which has been utilized, at one time or another, by all three of our business segments and, to a much lesser extent, by third-party commercial customers, including prime contractors to the U.S. government, who have outsourced a portion of their manufacturing to us. This allows us to secure volume discounts on key components, better control the quality of our manufacturing process and maximize the utilization of our manufacturing capacity.  Intersegment sales in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $1.7 million, $2.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively. In fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $0.5 million, $2.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively. 29We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. Additionally, we anticipate that our Board of Directors' previously disclosed exploration of strategic alternatives could result in greater than normal employee turnover.30•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations.Future acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount that was established by our Board of Directors. On December 9, 2013, our Board of Directors increased our annual target dividend from $1.10 per common share to $1.20 per common share. We have paid quarterly dividends for sixteen consecutive quarters and, in fiscal 2014, we paid $18.7 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.31The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.From time to time, we receive correspondence alleging that a product or other part of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently conducted.If any technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.32Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes related to ongoing military conflicts;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•changes in the status of U.S. government investigations relating to our CEO;•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock"
12,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2013-10-03,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition.We participate in the global commercial and government communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past several years, our customers and the end-markets that we serve have been materially impacted by adverse global economic conditions. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. These conditions have already resulted in: (i) changes to our commercial and government customers’ historical spending priorities, (ii) reduced military budgets, and (iii) extreme pressures on government budgets throughout the world. In addition to operating in a difficult global economic environment, some of our end customers are located in emerging countries that are currently undergoing sweeping political changes. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it remains possible that another worldwide credit crisis could occur. We believe that the aggregation of these conditions has resulted in the current suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. Although we believe that we will ultimately experience long-term growth, these adverse conditions could last for many years. We believe that nearly all of our customers will continue to face capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. If worldwide interest rates increase, it is possible that new projects to install or upgrade telecommunications networks that are currently being contemplated by our customers, particularly in emerging markets which generally receive financing from European banks and/or financial assistance from various governments, will be postponed or canceled.None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. •Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.19Index•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build outs from large European commercial banks and/or financial assistance from various governments. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.Our 2014 business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast, as operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our mobile data communications segment is expected to experience a significant decline in revenues in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Although we believe that we will receive additional BFT-1 contract awards, our two-year $43.6 million BFT-1 sustainment contract with the U.S. Army expires on March 31, 2014. Given U.S. government budget pressures and the unknown timing of the U.S. Army's plan to roll-out the next generation BFT system, it is possible that our current BFT-1 contract will not be renewed, extended or replaced with a new contract for performance periods beyond March 31, 2014. As such, it is possible that the U.S. Army may not exercise its option to renew its annual $10.0 million intellectual property license for our BFT-1 technology beyond March 31, 2014.Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities that reduce the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) budget and the U.S. government's debt could have a material adverse effect on us including negatively impacting our fiscal 2014 business outlook. During fiscal years ended July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $110.9 million, $207.8 million and $378.0 million or 34.7%, 48.9% and 61.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Excluding net sales in our mobile data communications segment (which derives a substantial majority of its net sales from the U.S. government), sales to the U.S. government represented 28.2%, 32.4% and 29.3% of remaining net sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Approximately 24.6% of our backlog at July 31, 2013 consisted of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2014 and beyond depends, in part, on receiving new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budget pressures.20IndexIn connection with legislation already passed, it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts appropriated for our products and services. As such, certain assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.  The impact of a legislation process known as sequestration (or mandated reductions) and the current U.S. government partial shutdown remains a significant risk. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period and certain impacts were incorporated in the U.S. government's fiscal year 2013 budget. Part II mandated substantial additional reductions which took effect March 1, 2013, and resulted in approximately $40.0 billion of additional reductions to the U.S. government's fiscal year 2013 defense budget.On April 10, 2013, the President of the United States delivered his proposed government fiscal 2014 budget to Congress which included lower final defense appropriations as compared to its fiscal 2013. This proposed budget does not reflect the reductions mandated by Part II of the Budget Control Act and is the subject of ongoing significant debate and an uncertain schedule. If Congress does not take legislative action, sequestration will be applied to defense spending during the government's fiscal 2014. If Congress does not timely pass a fiscal 2014 defense appropriation or a continuing resolution, we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments. In June 2013, the DoD provided a report to Congress on how it proposed to distribute the reductions required by sequestration across certain spending accounts and funding lines and we are not certain how these potential reductions might impact the sale of our products and services. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present. The Unites States' debt ceiling also continues to be a major outstanding fiscal issue, with the debt limit currently expected to be reached shortly. Congress and the President continue to debate raising the debt ceiling, among other fiscal issues, as they negotiate plans for long-term national fiscal policy. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on future defense spending. In addition, if the existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt is not raised, we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments. Faced with continued budget uncertainty and continued threats to national security, the DoD is reviewing the roles and structure of the U.S. military and its overall strategy including force posture, investments and institutional management. Actions stemming from the review, which is expected to be provided to Congress during the government's fiscal 2014, as well as any alternative budget plans proposed by the DoD and considered by Congress, may impact future funding for our programs.We believe that despite budget pressures, spending on the modernization and maintenance of advanced communications systems that include our products and services will continue to be a national priority. Future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems, along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing systems and provide real-time integration of surveillance, information management, strike and battle management platforms. Our products and services are used in various programs involving command and control, network communications, enhanced situational awareness, satellite systems and restricted programs as well as numerous international and homeland security programs. Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long-term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. We have experienced some recent delays of orders resulting from the U.S. government partial shutdown and it is possible that this partial shutdown will continue for a prolonged period. We cannot predict the outcome of the U.S. government budget issues or the length or magnitude of the impact of the current partial shutdown. As such, it is possible that our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2014 and beyond may significantly be impacted. In addition, ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience further delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2014 business and financial outlook, our operating results and our financial condition.21IndexOur contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to unique business and commercial risks.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audit by various agencies and the outcome of audits are difficult to predict. All of our U.S. government contracts, such as our Advanced Time Division Multiple Access (""TDMA"") Interface Processor (""ATIP"") contract with the U.S. Navy with a potential value of $29.0 million, can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or “TINA” audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. In the past, we have been audited with no material adjustments proposed.As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in May 2011, we were notified that our original BFT-1 contract, which was awarded to us on August 31, 2007 (our fiscal 2008), was selected for a post award audit by the DCAA. We received total funded orders against this contract, which expired December 31, 2011, of $376.2 million. A post award audit generally focuses on whether the contractor disclosed current, accurate and complete cost or pricing data in the contract negotiation process pursuant to TINA and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”). Shortly after this audit began, the Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”) advised us that the fiscal 2008 award of the BFT-1 contract triggered full coverage under the Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) and that we should submit an initial CAS disclosure statement. The CAS is a set of specialized rules and standards that the U.S. government uses for determining costs on large, negotiated contracts. We have cooperated fully with the DCAA and DCMA and provided them information that supports our view that the August 2007 BFT-1 contract is subject to a CAS and TINA exemption for fixed price commercial contract line items (such as our mobile satellite transceivers and other hardware), as defined by the FAR. In March 2013, DCMA advised us that it was not making any determination with regard to the commerciality of our products and that it withdrew its request, at that time, for a CAS disclosure statement.In May 2013, the DCAA provided us a draft audit report which stated that the commercial item exemption to TINA did not apply because there was no official determination of commerciality for Delivery Order No. 1 at the time of award. Thus, according to the DCAA, TINA applied and we were required to disclose current, accurate and complete cost or pricing data. The DCAA recommended a price adjustment of $11.8 million (plus interest). This recommended price adjustment is essentially the same amount that was included in a draft audit report that was presented to us in December 2012.22IndexConsistent with the position we have taken throughout the audit, we informed the DCAA that we believe the May 2013 draft audit report is erroneous. Among other things, we noted that the U.S. Army had previously determined, in July 2007, that the MT 2011F mobile satellite transceiver was a commercial item on a separate contract awarded to us. We also noted that the same contracting officer who signed the August 2007 BFT-1 contract, in an email sent four days after the BFT-1 contract was signed, indicated that certain of our mobile satellite transceivers and other equipment on the August 2007 BFT-1 contract were commercial. We advised the DCAA that, although the August 2007 BFT-1 contract did not initially incorporate FAR commercial clauses, the contract was modified in January 2008 to incorporate those clauses, and that an Administrative Contracting Officer confirmed, in January 2008, that Delivery Order No. 1 was for commercial items. Regardless of the commerciality determination, we informed the DCAA that we provided the U.S. Army with all information required under TINA and the FAR prior to August 31, 2007. We disagree with the DCAA's draft audit report and provided a written response in May 2013. We have not heard back from the DCAA since submitting our written response. We intend to vigorously dispute any claim by the U.S. government in regards to this matter.Although we do not believe that we will ultimately be required to refund monies to the U.S. government, if it is ultimately determined that a cost or price adjustment for our BFT-1 contract is appropriate, we would be required to refund monies to the U.S. government, with interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Future audits on other contracts may result in proposed adjustments that ultimately could also have a material adverse effect on our result of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain our expected levels of mobile data communications segment revenues in future years.Our mobile data communications segment is expected to experience a significant decline in revenues in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Operating income in fiscal 2014 for this segment and for the foreseeable future is expected to be largely driven by the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee for our BFT-1 technology. We currently generate BFT-1 sustainment revenue (including the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee) pursuant to a two-year $43.6 million BFT-1 contract which expires March 31, 2014.  Given current U.S. government budget pressures and the unknown timing of the U.S. Army's roll-out of the next generation BFT system, it is possible that we may not generate any additional revenue or operating income associated with BFT-1 sustainment services (including the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee) beyond March 31, 2014.  Although we expect that our BFT-1 contract will be renewed, extended or replaced, the amount of future operating income associated with BFT-1 sustainment activities may, in the future, be significantly lower. Specific terms and conditions related to the annual$10.0 million intellectual property license fee are covered by a separate licensing agreement that provides for annual renewals, at the U.S. Army's option, for up to a five-year period ending March 31, 2017, after which time the U.S. Army will have a limited non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property for no additional intellectual property licensing fee.  If the U.S. Army does not exercise its option to renew the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, it would have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2014 business outlook, our future business outlook and our future operating results.  We have recently completed a repositioning of our mobile data communications segment and we intend to focus future business development activities primarily on our current BFT-1 customer. We believe that by seeking to work collaboratively with the U.S. Army to ensure that its short-term and long-term needs are addressed, we will enhance our competitive positioning for potential new awards and programs in the future. We also expect to continue to offer our customers niche products.  If we are ultimately unable to significantly increase sales of our current products, develop and sell new products or services, win new programs or replace the operating income contribution of the annual $10.0 million intellectual property license fee, our mobile data communications segment may not be able to generate any meaningful operating income beyond March 31, 2017. Given the various uncertainties related to our BFT-1 sustainment activities and the success of our future business development activities, our operating results in fiscal 2014 and beyond could be more volatile and it could be more difficult in the future to accurately project consolidated gross margins, operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period.23IndexThe outcome of U.S. government investigations are difficult to predict. In June 2012, certain officers and employees of the Company received subpoenas issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) seeking certain documents and records relating to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Although the EDNY subpoenas make no specific allegations, we believe the subpoenas relate to a grand jury investigation stemming from our CEO's contacts with a scientific attaché to the Israeli Purchasing Mission in the United States who our CEO met in connection with the sale of our equipment to the State of Israel during the 1980's. This scientific attaché was later alleged to have conducted intelligence operations in the U.S. In August 2012, we were informed by the U.S. government that our CEO's security clearance was suspended. In order to maintain our qualification for government contracts requiring facility security clearance, we have made certain internal organizational realignments. These changes restrict access to classified information to other Comtech senior executives, management and other employees who maintain the required level of clearance. Separately, in connection with an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) into trading in securities of CPI International, Inc. (“CPI”), we and our CEO, among others, received subpoenas in 2012 for documents from the SEC concerning transactions in CPI stock by our CEO and other persons (including one subsidiary employee). Our CEO purchased CPI stock in November 2010, after the September 2010 termination of our May 2010 agreement to acquire CPI.We and our CEO have cooperated with the U.S. government regarding the above matters and neither he nor the Company has been contacted by the U.S. government with respect to either matter since September 2012. The independent members of our Board of Directors have monitored these matters with the assistance of independent counsel. The outcome of any investigation is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to predict. However, based on our work to date in respect of the subpoenas in each matter, we do not believe that it is likely that either investigation will result in a legal proceeding against our CEO or the Company. If either of these investigations were to result in a legal proceeding, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 50.1%, 38.7% and 30.2% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: •We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.24Index•We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2013, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $169.9 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $125.9 million and $44.0 million relates to our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments, respectively.In accordance with FASB ASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we perform goodwill impairment testing at least annually, unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. The impairment test for goodwill uses a two-step approach. Step one compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, step two must be performed. Step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.  For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. We perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year, unless there are other indicators of impairment. The annual goodwill impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Based on our fiscal 2014 annual impairment test (performed on August 1, 2013 - the first day of our fiscal 2014), we concluded that the estimated fair value for each of our reporting units was reasonable. However, we concluded that as of August 1, 2013, our RF microwave amplifiers reporting unit was at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. As discussed further in ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill"", if we do not at least meet the assumed revenue growth utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis, our RF microwave amplifiers reporting unit will likely fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in a future period. Modest changes in key assumptions used in our impairment analysis may also result in the requirement to proceed to step two of the goodwill impairment test in future periods. If we perform a step two test, up to $44.0 million of goodwill and intangibles assigned to this reporting unit could be written off in the period that the impairment is triggered. In addition, if assumed revenue growth for our telecommunications transmission segment is not achieved, this segment could also, in future periods, be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. It is possible that, during fiscal 2014, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state and our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. A significant decline in defense spending that is greater than we anticipate or a shift in funding priorities may also have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows and we might be required to perform a step one interim goodwill impairment test during fiscal 2014. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual step one goodwill impairment test on August 1, 2014 (the start of our fiscal 2015). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events and circumstances change (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record impairment charges when we perform these tests, or in other future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.25IndexWe could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain customers.We face the risk of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be constantly under attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. Our customers' systems and certain of our equipment are under frequent attack.As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer's IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could: •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and •Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally. In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a future material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.26IndexNoncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with certain international, as well as domestic, laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: •We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.•Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business.•We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2010 through 2013 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.27IndexAll of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of industry standards such as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or an unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. Since fiscal 2006, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.28Index•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.•We may incur additional expenses associated with complying with SEC rules and reporting requirements related to Conflict Minerals – In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These new SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules will likely impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase.We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) of the U.S. Department of State and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.29IndexOur dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our telecommunications transmission segment operates our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona which has been utilized, at one time or another, by all three of our business segments and, to a much lesser extent, by third-party commercial customers, including prime contractors to the U.S. government, who have outsourced a portion of their manufacturing to us. This allows us to secure volume discounts on key components, better control the quality of our manufacturing process and maximize the utilization of our manufacturing capacity.  Intersegment sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $2.3 million, $5.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $2.7 million, $11.2 million and $37.0 million, respectively. We intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.30IndexWe face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. Our expected long-term growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations.We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $100.0 million secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.31IndexOur secured revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan.We have a committed $100.0 million, secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders that expires on April 30, 2014 but may be extended by us to December 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants limiting certain debt, certain liens on assets, certain sales of assets and receivables, certain payments (including dividends), certain repurchases of equity securities, certain sale and leaseback transactions, certain guaranties and certain investments. The Credit Facility also contains financial condition covenants requiring that we: (i) not exceed a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Facility); (ii) not exceed a maximum ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Facility); (iii) maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility); (iv) maintain a minimum consolidated net worth; in each case measured on the last day of each fiscal quarter, and (v) in the event total consolidated indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than $200.0 million, we maintain a minimum level of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility). Our Credit Facility also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted.If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, an event of default under our Credit Facility could constitute an event of default under our 3.0% senior convertible notes, requiring us to repay the outstanding principal amount of the notes and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.In September 2011, our Board of Directors approved an annual targeted dividend of $1.10 per common share. We have paid quarterly dividends for twelve consecutive quarters and, in fiscal 2013, we paid $18.9 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.32IndexFrom time to time, we receive correspondence alleging that a product or other part of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently conducted.If any technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (such as the declaration of cash dividends on our common stock) and contain certain restrictions and covenants. We can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events, including a change in control. Accordingly, we may be required to repurchase the $200.0 million of 3.0% convertible senior notes on May 1, 2014, which is in our fiscal 2014. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance them. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. 33IndexOur stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes related to ongoing military conflicts;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•changes in the status of U.S. government investigations relating to our CEO;•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock"
9,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2012-09-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition.We participate in the global commercial and government communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past several years, our customers and the end-markets that we serve have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. These conditions have already resulted in: (i) changes to our commercial and government customers’ historical spending priorities, (ii) reduced military budgets, and (iii) extreme pressures on government budgets throughout the world. In addition to operating in a difficult global economic environment, some of our end customers are located in emerging countries that are currently undergoing sweeping political changes. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it is possible that a worldwide credit crisis could occur. We believe that the aggregation of these conditions has resulted in the current suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. Although we believe that we will ultimately experience long-term growth, these adverse conditions could last for many years. We believe that nearly all of our customers will continue to face capital and operating budget constraints and a much tighter credit environment. None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:•Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. •Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. These reductions have impacted all three of our business segments. The overall business environment remains challenging. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.•Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.18Index•Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.Our 2013 business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast, as operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile. We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our mobile data communications segment is expected to experience a material decline in revenues and related operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.Changes in government policy could have a material adverse effect on us.In past years, we benefited from increased Department of Defense (“DoD”) spending relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This trend is not expected to continue. We believe the U.S. government policies related to troop withdrawals and reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan will result in a reduction of future orders for our products and services. Historical spending patterns, for the types of communication products that we sell, are therefore not meaningful when estimating future product demand. These policies or future changes in these or other policies or priorities could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. A shifting political environment makes it more difficult than usual to estimate our future income and expenses. The future direction of the political environment, including potential changes in policies relating to the ongoing military conflict in Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to obtain future business with the U.S. government.In past years, our business has depended, in large part, on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately 48.9%, 61.7%, and 71.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately 36.2% of our backlog at July 31, 2012 consisted of orders from U.S. government contracts, U.S. government subcontracts and U.S. government funded programs. Our U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including:•unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;•unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;•reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities;•higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and•unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.19IndexAll of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. Also, we obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.The outcome of ongoing U.S. government investigations are difficult to predict. In June 2012, certain officers and employees of the Company received subpoenas issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (“EDNY”) seeking certain documents and records relating to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Although the EDNY subpoenas make no specific allegations, we believe the subpoenas relate to a grand jury investigation stemming from our CEO's contacts with a scientific attaché to the Israeli Purchasing Mission in the United States who our CEO met in connection with the sale of our equipment to the State of Israel during the 1980's. This scientific attaché was later alleged to have conducted intelligence operations in the U.S. In August 2012, we were informed by the U.S. government that our CEO's security clearance was suspended. In order to maintain our qualification for government contracts requiring facility security clearance, we have made certain internal organizational realignments. These changes restrict access to classified information to other Comtech senior executives, management and other employees who maintain the required level of clearance. Separately, in connection with an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) into trading in securities of CPI International, Inc. (“CPI”), we and our CEO, among others, have received subpoenas for documents from the SEC concerning transactions in CPI stock by our CEO and other persons (including one subsidiary employee). Our CEO purchased CPI stock in November 2010, after the September 2010 termination of our May 2010 agreement to acquire CPI.We and our CEO are cooperating with the U.S. government regarding the above matters. The independent members of our Board of Directors are monitoring these matters with the assistance of independent counsel. The outcome of any investigation is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to predict. However, based on our work to date in respect of the subpoenas in each matter, we do not believe that it is likely that either investigation will result in a legal proceeding against our CEO or the Company. If either of these investigations results in a legal proceeding, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Government contract audits could have an adverse financial impact on us. All of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in May 2011, we were informed by the DCAA that it selected our BFT-1 contract for a post-award audit. We had previously been informed that the DCAA would issue its report by September 2012. The DCAA has not yet rendered its report and we do not currently know the timing of the issuance of this report. Through July 31, 2012, we received $377.0 million in total funded orders under our $384.0 million BFT-1 contract that expired December 31, 2011. Ultimately, if the DCAA issues a report and the U.S. government determines that a cost or price adjustment for our BFT-1 contract is appropriate, we may be required to refund certain monies to the U.S. government, with interest. These amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain customers.We face the risk of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems. Our IT network and systems are constantly under attack and we face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of the IT networks and related systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. Our customers' systems are also frequently under attack.20IndexThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. As a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could: •Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; •Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; •Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions; •Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; •Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and •Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally. In addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches may significantly increase and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities to reduce the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) budget and the U.S. Government’s debt could have a material adverse effect on us.We believe that the budget for the U.S. DoD will be reduced from current levels over the next decade. In addition to debt reduction efforts already authorized, it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, government programs which we participate in.Debt-ceiling reduction legislation that was enacted in 2011 requires reductions of approximately $487.0 billion in Pentagon and national security agency budgets over the next ten years. On November 23, 2011, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (commonly referred to as the Super Committee which was established as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011) failed to recommend legislation that would reduce net U.S. government spending by at least $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. As of September 26, 2012, Congress has not yet identified the required spending reductions and as a result, it is possible that there will be an automatic sequestration of discretionary appropriations for U.S. defense programs. Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. 21IndexUltimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2013 business and financial outlook, our operating results or our financial condition.We may not be able to maintain our expected levels of mobile data communications segment revenues in future years.As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we expect revenues and related operating income in our mobile data communications segment to materially decline in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. As a result, we have initiated and have implemented targeted actions to align our cost structure and are continuing the process of refining our mobile data communications segment’s business strategies.We are currently providing sustainment services to the U.S. Army's MTS and BFT-1 programs under a three-year IDIQ contract. The base performance period on this contract is April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013. The contract provides for two twelve-month option periods exercisable by the U.S. Army and, except for a fixed annual intellectual property (“IP”) license fee of $10.0 million, the three-year $80.7 million contract value is subject to finalization and downward negotiation. Payments of annual IP license fees beyond the base year are contingent upon the U.S. Army's exercise of optional performance periods. Because this contract is an IDIQ contract, it can be terminated at any time and the U.S. Army is not obligated to purchase any additional equipment or services. Sales for MTS and BFT-1 products and services in fiscal 2012 were approximately $87.8 million and our business outlook assumes a material decline in such revenues in fiscal 2013. As further described below, given the various uncertainties related to our BFT-1 sustainment activities, our operating results in fiscal 2013 and beyond are likely to be more volatile and it will be more difficult than in the past to accurately project gross margins and our related operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period. Our ability to accurately predict BFT-1 sustainment activities in fiscal 2013 and beyond is subject to a number of future events, including new orders, new contracts, contract extensions (including the exercise of optional performance periods), contract ceiling increases, unpredictable funding, as well as deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. We believe that the U.S. Army may have begun deploying BFT-2 equipment in Korea and according to published reports on the U.S. Army's website, will also begin deploying BFT-2 equipment in Afghanistan in our fiscal 2013. As such, if the U.S. Army does not exercise the optional performance periods and we do not receive new orders, new contracts, contract extensions or contract ceiling increases, our mobile data communications segment's revenues in future periods will decline significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our 2013 business outlook, our future business outlook, and our current and future operating results. We believe that by seeking to work collaboratively with the U.S. Army to ensure that its short-term and long-term needs are addressed, we will enhance our competitive positioning for a potential new award in the future. Ultimately, we may not be successful and our business outlook could be negatively impacted.Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with certain international, as well as domestic, laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: •We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 22IndexThe government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.•Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business.•We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (""RoHS"") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 are subject to potential future Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2012, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $176.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $129.6 million and $46.6 million relates to our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers segments, respectively.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. We perform an annual impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year, unless there are other indicators of impairment. Based on our annual impairment review performed as of August 1, 2012, we concluded that our RF microwave amplifiers and our telecommunications transmission reporting units had an estimated fair value in excess of total asset book value of approximately 84.0% and 7.0%, respectively.The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. If global conditions continue to deteriorate from current levels, or if the market value of our equity or assets significantly declines, or we are not successful in achieving our expected sales levels, or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable, our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired.23IndexAlthough we performed our fiscal 2013 impairment testing on August 1, 2012 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill, changes in our future operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill in future operating periods. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of industry standards such as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion.Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains patents associated with the technology. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or an unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:•If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.•Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. Since fiscal 2006, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.24Index•Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increased costs and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.•We may incur additional expenses and not be able to comply with SEC reporting requirements related to conflict minerals – In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding a company's use of conflict minerals. These new SEC rules could result in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules will likely impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and or raw material prices could increase. We may also have difficulty verifying the supply of conflict minerals to their source and, therefore, may not be able to comply with the SEC's conflict minerals reporting requirement.We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) of the U.S. Department of State and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance certain policies and procedures including establishing a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 38.7%, 30.2% and 22.9% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: •We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.25Index•We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.•We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close to major earthquake fault lines and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Company-wide, we depend on our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment, to manufacture certain products and components for all three of our business segments. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $5.4 million, $3.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $11.2 million, $37.0 million and $82.2 million, respectively. We intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on all three of our business segments, results of operations and financial condition. 26IndexIn the past, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these or other government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfilling orders from our customers. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:•The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. Our expected long-term growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.•We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.27Index•Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations.We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $100.0 million secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan.We have a committed $100.0 million, secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders that expires on April 30, 2014 but may be extended by us to December 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants limiting certain debt, certain liens on assets, certain sales of assets and receivables, certain payments (including dividends), certain repurchases of equity securities, certain sale and leaseback transactions, certain guaranties and certain investments. The Credit Facility also contains financial condition covenants requiring that we: (i) not exceed a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Facility); (ii) not exceed a maximum ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Facility); (iii) maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility); (iv) maintain a minimum consolidated net worth; in each case measured on the last day of each fiscal quarter, and (v) in the event total consolidated indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than $200.0 million, we maintain a minimum level of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility). Our Credit Facility, as amended, also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted.If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, an event of default under our Credit Facility could constitute an event of default under our 3.0% senior convertible notes, requiring us to repay the outstanding principal amount of the notes and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.28IndexIf we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.In September 2011, our Board of Directors approved an annual targeted dividend of $1.10 per common share. We have paid quarterly dividends for eight straight quarters and, in fiscal 2012, we paid $22.6 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.From time to time, we receive correspondence alleging that a product or other part of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated.If any technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.29IndexOur debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (such as the declaration of cash dividends on our common stock) and contain certain restrictions and covenants. We can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events, including a change in control. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance them. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:•strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;•issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;•quality deficiencies in services or products;•results of technological innovations;•new commercial products;•changes in recommendations of securities analysts;•government regulations;•changes in the status or outcome of government audits;•proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;•changes in U.S. government policies;•changes related to ongoing military conflicts;•changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;•changes in securities market conditions, generally;•changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);•changes in the status of U.S government investigations relating to our CEO;•cyber-attacks;•energy blackouts;•acts of terrorism or war;•inflation or deflation; and•rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock"
0,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2011-09-27,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Our 2012 and future business outlook and operating results are difficult to forecast, are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile. We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifier segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our mobile data communications segment will experience a material decline in revenues and related operating income in fiscal 2012. In addition, we are currently in the process of repositioning our mobile data communications segment’s business strategies, the outcome of which is difficult to predict.Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general economic conditions.Changes in government policy, including changes in U.S. policies relating to Iraq and Afghanistan could have a material adverse effect on us.In past years, we have benefited from increased Department of Defense (“DoD”) spending relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue. The U.S. government has issued policies related to Iraq and Afghanistan that include formal troop withdrawals and reductions. We believe such policy changes resulted in a reduction of orders we received in fiscal 2011 and that historical spending patterns, for the types of communication products that we sell, are no longer meaningful when estimating future product demand. These policies or future changes in these or other policies or priorities could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. A shifting political environment makes it more difficult than usual to estimate our future income and expenses. The future direction of the political environment, including potential changes in policies relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  18  The continued effects of the adverse global economic climate could have a material adverse impact on our business outlook, our business, operating results and financial condition.We participate in the global commercial and government communications markets, which are characterized by rapid technological advances and constant changes. For the past few years, our customers and the end markets that we serve have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. These conditions have already resulted in (i) changes to our commercial and government customers’ historical spending priorities, (ii) reduced military budgets and (iii) extreme pressures on government budgets throughout the world. In addition to operating in a difficult global economic environment, some of our end customers are located in emerging countries that are currently undergoing sweeping political changes. In the past few months, European monetary issues and concerns have intensified and it is possible that a worldwide credit crisis could occur. We believe that the aggregation of these conditions has resulted in the current suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. Although we believe that we will ultimately experience long-term growth, these adverse conditions could last for many years. We believe that nearly all of our customers will continue to face capital and operating budget constraints and a much tighter credit environment. None of our three operating segments have been immune to these adverse conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:·  Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. ·  Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. These reductions have impacted all three of our business segments. The overall business environment remains challenging. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.·  Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers’ ability to obtain the sufficient financing they may require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. Our customers’ inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.·  Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.   19  Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to obtain future business with the U.S. government.In past years, our business has depended, in large part, on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately 61.7%, 71.1% and 56.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 59.3% of our backlog at July 31, 2011 consisted of orders from U.S. government contracts, U.S. government subcontracts and U.S. government funded programs. Our U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including:·  unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions; ·  unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations; ·  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities; ·  higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and ·  unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. Also, we obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process.There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.Government contract audits could have an adverse financial impact on us. All of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”) and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. For example, in May 2011, we were informed by the DCAA that it selected our BFT-1 contract for a post-award audit. Through July 31, 2011, we received $343.9 million in total funded orders under our BFT-1 contract. Ultimately, if the DCAA determines that a price adjustment for our BFT-1 contract is appropriate, we may be required to refund certain costs previously reimbursed to us by the U.S. government, with interest. These amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.  20  Reductions in spending or changes in spending priorities to reduce the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) budget and the U.S. Government’s debt could have a material adverse effect on us.We believe that the budget for the U.S. DoD will be reduced from current levels over the next decade. In addition to debt reduction efforts already authorized, it is possible that the U.S. government could reduce or further delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, government programs which we participate in.Recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires reductions of approximately $350 billion in Pentagon and national security agency budgets over the next ten years. Further, if the Joint House and Senate Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is unsuccessful in reaching an agreement on a deficit reduction plan by late November 2011, the recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires significant cuts in federal spending, which would result in further reductions to defense budgets and which could likely have a negative impact our 2012 business outlook.Although the types of communications products and services we offer appear to be a funding priority over the long term, a significant decline in defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in funding priorities. Ultimately, the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We face increased risks associated with our strategies to reposition our mobile data communications segment.As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we expect a material decline in revenues and related operating income in our mobile data communications segment. As a result, we have initiated targeted actions to align our cost structure and are in the process of refining our mobile data communications segment’s business strategies. Despite the award of BFT-2 to a third party competitor, we intend to continue to work cooperatively with the U.S. Army and support their planned transition to BFT-2. We also intend to participate in any potential BFT-3 surveys or proposals. We believe that by seeking to work collaboratively with the U.S. Army to ensure that its short-term and long-term needs are addressed, we will enhance our competitive positioning for a potential new award in the future. Ultimately, we may not be successful and our business outlook would be negatively impacted. We currently intend to continue our efforts in establishing a leadership position in the microsatellite industry. We offer both government and commercial customers the design and production of microsatellites that provide a portion of the functionality of expensive large satellites but at a fraction of the cost. We have established a modest position in this market. We also expect to continue to market and develop our non-MTS and BFT-1 solutions in a methodical way. In the past, we have demonstrated that there a number of opportunities for us to market our products and solutions to other potential customers whose needs would be well met by our technology offerings. In addition, in connection with our partnership with Thuraya Telecommunications Co., a satellite services operator, we have been developing a maritime terminal to provide high-quality voice and broadband services to commercial marine vessels. Sales of our mobile data communications segment’s non-MTS and BFT-1 related products and services have historically not been material. Our future success in further developing these markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to access effective distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which provide us a competitive advantage, and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, because we intend to invest only modest amounts in marketing, sales and research and development efforts, we may not be able to penetrate these markets in a significant way.The repositioning of our mobile data communications segment has also resulted in increased employee turnover, both voluntary and involuntary. The future success of our repositioning will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Because of the increased turnover and competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to reposition and operate profitably. If are unable to attract and retain the personnel we will need, our repositioning may ultimately not be successful.   21  Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: ·  We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us and, if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us. ·  Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of the frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business. ·  We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the RoHS directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our tax returns for fiscal year 2004 through 2009 were recently audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and we may be audited in the future. Although adjustments relating to our settlements for fiscal 2004 through 2009 federal tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   22   Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2011, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $182.8 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $133.5 million and $49.2 million relates to our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifier segments, respectively, and $0.1 million relates our mobile data communications segment.For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. We perform an annual impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year, unless there are other indicators of impairment.Based on our annual impairment review performed as of August 1, 2011, we concluded that our RF microwave amplifiers and our telecommunications transmission reporting units had an estimated fair value in excess of total asset book value of approximately 78.0% and 6.0%, respectively.The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods.If global conditions continue to deteriorate from current levels, or if the market value of our equity or assets significantly declines, or we are not successful in achieving our expected sales levels, or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable, our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired.Although we performed our fiscal 2012 impairment testing on August 1, 2011 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill, changes in our future operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill in future operating periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of new industry standards such as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive.The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion.Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains patents associated with the technology. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note (14)(c) Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8. — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we are a party to a lawsuit involving this technology.A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or an unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  23  Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:·  If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. ·  Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. Since fiscal 2006, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increased costs and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.   24  We could be adversely affected if we violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).In the past, we have reported violations of ITAR to the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) of the U.S. Department of State. We recently had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance certain policies and procedures including establishing a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. The DDTC closed their review of our compliance with ITAR without assessing any fines or penalties.We continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with ITAR and related regulations. We may be subjected to ITAR compliance audits in the future that may not be successful and could result in an unfavorable outcome which could cause actual results to differ materially or adversely from those anticipated. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction against us. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 30.2%, 22.9% and 32.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: ·  We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.·  We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.·  We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.   25  We have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close to major earthquake fault lines and also manufactures amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Company-wide, we depend on our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment, to manufacture for all three of our business segments. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $3.8 million, $7.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $37.0 million, $82.2 million and $53.0 million, respectively. We intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on all three of our business segments, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these or other government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfilling orders from our customers. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.   26   Our MTS and BFT-1 business activities are subject to a number of unique risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.In addition to the other risks described in this section, the risks applicable to our MTS and BFT-1 business activities include the following:·  Our 2012 Business Outlook could be volatile given the uncertainties related to BFT-1– Sales for MTS and BFT-1 products and services in fiscal 2011 were approximately $248.6 million and our business outlook assumes a material decline in such revenues in fiscal 2012. As further described below, given the various uncertainties related to our MTS and BFT-1 business activities, our operating results in fiscal 2012 and beyond are likely to be more volatile and it will be more difficult than in the past to accurately project gross margins and our related operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period. Our ability to accurately predict MTS and BFT-1 business activities in fiscal 2012 and beyond is subject to new contracts, contract extensions, contract ceilings, unpredictable funding, as well as deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. ·  Our BFT-1 contract is nearing its expiration and we may not receive any additional orders – We currently provide MTS and BFT-1 products and services pursuant to our existing BFT-1 contract. This contract currently expires on December 31, 2011 and we are committed to providing MTS related services through December 31, 2011 and BFT-1 services through March 31, 2012. Our current BFT-1 contract is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract and we can receive additional orders of $40.1 million before the current contract ceiling of $384.0 million is reached. Because this contract is an IDIQ contract, it can be terminated at any time and the U.S. Army is not obligated to purchase any additional equipment or services. If we do not receive a contract ceiling increase, a contract extension or are not awarded a new contract, we will not generate any additional revenues in the future and it would have a material adverse effect on our business outlook. ·  Our negotiations to obtain additional BFT-1 business may not be successful – In July 2010, we were advised by the U.S. Army Contracting Command-CECOM Contracting Center that we were not selected as the vendor for the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below, Blue Force Tracking-2 (“BFT-2”) program. The U.S. Army has indicated to us that it may require certain MTS and BFT-1 sustaining network engineering related services beyond March 31, 2012. Because we were not selected as the vendor for the BFT-2 program, we have limited visibility into the U.S. Army’s transition plans. During our initial negotiations to obtain a multi-year sustainment contract, the U.S. Army indicated that it may begin to purchase future satellite network transponder capacity directly, as early as calendar year 2012. We have informed the U.S. Army that if it proceeds on that basis, we intend to begin charging it a separate fee for the use of our intellectual property. We engaged a national valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated value of our intellectual property and based on that valuation, we provided a price quote to the U.S. Army. Given the current pressures on the U.S. defense budget and the lack of visibility that we have into the U.S. Army’s plans, we are not able to accurately predict the extent, if any, that we will be able to successfully negotiate a reasonable price for our intellectual property. If we are not successful in negotiating with the U.S. Army, we may not be able to generate any additional MTS or BFT-1 revenues beyond the orders that we currently have in backlog. ·  Our BFT-1 revenue and related earnings are dependent on third-party products or components – A significant portion of our mobile data communications segment revenues in fiscal 2012 are expected to be derived from sales of leased satellite capacity. We purchase satellite airtime and other products and services from third-party suppliers and incorporate them into our BFT-1 solutions which we sell to the U.S. Army. Our revenues and profitability are highly dependent on the ability of our satellite network providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. ·  We may incur material expenses if our BFT-1 network experiences downtime or fails – All satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service and our network systems occasionally experience downtime. Interruptions in service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should we be required to obtain or restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   27   Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.These risks include:·  The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements. Our expected long-term growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify. ·  We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.   28  Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations.We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:·  difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;·  diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and·  increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan.We have a committed $150.0 million, unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders that expires on January 31, 2014. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to incur debt, make certain payments (including dividends), repurchase shares of our common stock, sell certain assets, and make certain investments. It also requires us to maintain certain minimum levels of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) and does not allow us to permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to exceed certain ratios.Our Credit Facility, as amended, also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted.If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at the annual targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.In September 2010, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend on shares of our common stock with an annual dividend target of $1.00 per common share. Pursuant to this authorization, we paid $20.1 million of cash dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2011. In September 2011, our Board of Directors raised our annual targeted dividend from $1.00 per common share to $1.10 per common share.The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay annual dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.  29  Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of the protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition and restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated. For example, our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains the patent. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note (14)(c) Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8. — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we are a party to a lawsuit involving this technology.If the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.   30  Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (such as the declaration of cash dividends on our common stock) and contain certain restrictions and covenants. We can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events, including a change in control. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance them. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.  Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:·  strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;·  issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;·  future announcements concerning us or our competitors;·  receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;·  quality deficiencies in services or products;·  results of technological innovations;·  new commercial products;·  changes in recommendations of securities analysts;·  government regulations;·  changes in the status or outcome of government audits;·  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;·  changes in U.S. government policies;·  changes related to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan;·  changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;·  changes in securities market conditions, generally;·  changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);·  energy blackouts;·  acts of terrorism or war;·  inflation or deflation; and·  rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock"
2,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2010-09-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Our Fiscal 2009 acquisition of Radyne Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Radyne”) may ultimately not prove successful and we may not continue to realize anticipated benefits from this acquisition.We completed our acquisition restructuring plan related to our August 1, 2008 acquisition of Radyne in fiscal 2009. We have achieved operating efficiencies by eliminating redundant functions and related expenses by, among other things, vacating Radyne’s Phoenix, Arizona manufacturing facility, fully integrating Radyne’s satellite earth station product line’s manufacturing and engineering operations into our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and moving Radyne’s corporate functions to our Melville, New York corporate headquarters. Although we expect to continue to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the Radyne acquisition, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. In particular, the ongoing success of the Radyne acquisition will depend on maintaining the efficiencies and cost savings we have achieved to date, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to do so.  20  Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations. We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-off of intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:·  difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;·  diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and·  increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our business outlook is subject to a number of risks relating to the current economic climate.Overall global business conditions in all of our markets continue to be challenging. Nearly all businesses and governments around the world have been facing, and are continuing to face, capital and operating budget constraints and a much tighter credit environment. None of our three operating segments have been immune to these challenging conditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These challenging conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:·  Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current challenging economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.·  Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Our businesses have been negatively affected, both currently and in the past, by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. These reductions have impacted all three of our business segments. The overall business environment remains challenging. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact all three of our business segments. As a consequence, it is possible that our bookings in fiscal 2011 will not meet or exceed the levels achieved in fiscal 2010. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.·  Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by the ability of customers to obtain the substantial financing they require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. The inability of those customers to obtain sufficient credit would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.·Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.   21  Our operating results are difficult to forecast, subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile. We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifier segments’ net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. In addition, almost all of our net sales and orders from our mobile data communications segment are derived from our MTS and BFT-1 IDIQ contracts which are subject to contract ceilings, unpredictable funding, as well as deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. The recent loss of the BFT-2 program and ongoing MTS competition negatively impacts our ability to accurately forecast future operating results. Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, also may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general economic conditions. Changes in government policy, including changes in U.S. policies relating to Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on us.In recent years, we have benefited from increased Department of Defense spending relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue.In our fiscal 2009, new U.S. government policies were implemented related to Iraq and Afghanistan. These new policies included a formal plan for troop withdrawal from Iraq that is expected to conclude by the end of calendar 2011. In our fiscal 2010, the U.S. presidential administration announced a plan for troop withdrawal from Afghanistan that is expected to begin in July 2011. We believe such policy changes resulted in a reduction of orders we received in fiscal 2010.These policies or future changes in these or other policies (such as changes in U.S. health care policy) or priorities could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. A shifting political environment makes it more difficult than usual to estimate our future income and expenses. The future direction of the political environment including potential changes in policies relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.  22  Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to maintain U.S. government business.In recent years, we have increased our dependence on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately 71.1%, 56.4% and 66.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately 72.2% of our backlog at July 31, 2010 consisted of orders from U.S. government contracts, U.S. government subcontracts and U.S. government funded programs and we expect such business to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. Our U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including:·  unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions; ·  unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations; ·  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities; ·  penalties arising from post-award contract audits or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced; ·  higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and ·  unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government approval of final indirect rates. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. Also, we obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that the contracts we are awarded will ultimately be profitable. Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S.; however, we must comply with domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: ·  We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   23  The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us, and if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us. As discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, we could be adversely affected by the results of an upcoming independent audit of our compliance efforts with regard to export regulations that was requested by the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Department of State. ·  Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business. ·  Recycling regulations may significantly increase our costs – The European Union (“EU”) has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which directs EU member states to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally sound disposal of certain products placed on the market after August 13, 2005, and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced. The EU has also adopted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the EU after July 1, 2006. Similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions, including in the U.S., China and Japan. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible, and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us. There can be no assurance that such existing or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the RoHS directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Ongoing tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S., state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns were recently audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and our fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS. Other returns may be selected for audit in the future. Although adjustments relating to our fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2008, and other periods that may be selected for future audit, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  24  Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our Radyne acquisition, could be further impaired as a result of future business conditions or if we change our reporting unit structure. As of July 31, 2010, we have goodwill and intangible assets of $185.4 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of which $132.7 million and $51.8 million relates to goodwill and intangibles in our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifier segment, respectively, and $0.9 million relates to intangible assets, other than goodwill, in our mobile data communications segment. For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the reporting unit. We perform an annual impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year, unless there are other indicators of impairment.Based on our annual goodwill impairment review performed at the start of our first quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that none of the goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was impaired. However, in July 2010, we were advised by the U.S. Army that we were not selected as the program manager and vendor for the next-generation BFT program known as BFT-2. As a result, we experienced a significant and sustained decline in the market price of our common stock and we determined it was appropriate to conduct an interim goodwill impairment test for all three of our reporting units. Based on our interim impairment analysis, we determined that all of our mobile data communications reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired. As a result, during fiscal 2010, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $13.2 million. We also concluded that the goodwill of our telecommunications transmission and RF microwave amplifiers reporting units was not impaired.The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods.  Although we performed our fiscal 2011 impairment testing on August 1, 2010 and determined that there was no additional impairment of our goodwill, changes in our future operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in a further impairment of goodwill in future operating periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of new industry standards such as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains patents associated with the technology. As discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note (14)(c) Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we are a party to a lawsuit involving this technology. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, or unsuccessful outcome of defending our rights to licensed technologies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  25  Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:·  If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. ·  Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. In fiscal 2006, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation,” a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The adoption of the new standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increased costs and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement that we must file our financial statements with the SEC using the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with XBRL and IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.   26  We could be adversely affected if our upcoming International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) audit finds further violations of ITAR regulations.As a result of our prior violations related to the ITAR and pursuant to the request of the Enforcement Division of the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) of the U.S. Department of State, in September 2010, we submitted an ITAR compliance audit plan to be performed by an independent auditor. The audit plan and the independent audit firm selected have both been approved by the DDTC. The results of the audit must be provided to the DDTC by December 2010. Should we or the independent auditor identify a weakness relating to our ITAR compliance, the ongoing costs of remediation could be material. If the independent audit finds violations and/or the DDTC reopens the case against us that was closed in fiscal 2010 for any circumstances, it could result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties and/or result in an injunction against us, all of which, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 22.9%, 32.1% and 26.7% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: ·  We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.·  We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.·  We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failure to obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.   27  We have significant operations in Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close to major earthquake fault lines.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, we have increased the company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were $82.2 million, $53.0 million and $123.8 million, respectively. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $7.2 million, $14.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. We intend to continue to increase our company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology manufacturing center. We also intend to continue to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities, and as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on all three of our business segments, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these or other government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfilling orders from our customers.  28  Our MTS and BFT-1 contracts and related business activities are subject to a number of unique risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition to the other risks described in this section, the risks applicable to our MTS and BFT-1 business include the following: ·  Our MTS and BFT-1 contracts are IDIQ contracts and can be terminated at any time – Our mobile data communications segment’s revenues and profits are primarily derived from our MTS and BFT-1 contracts. Our telecommunications transmission segment’s operating results are impacted positively or negatively by the amount of MTS and BFT-1 orders received because it manufactures our MTS and BFT-1 satellite transceivers. Both of these contracts can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. Because both of these contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, the U.S. Army is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under these contracts. If such contracts are terminated or if MTS and BFT-1 revenues decline, operating results in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments will be adversely affected. ·  Our current MTS contract is nearing expiration – Sales to the MTS program in fiscal 2010 were approximately $369.6 million. Our MTS contract currently expires January 13, 2011. Through July 31, 2010, we have received $668.7 million in total orders under our $899.1 million contract. If we ultimately do not receive a further contract ceiling increase, a contract extension or are not awarded a new contract, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Competition for the next-generation MTS contract is increasing – Our MTS contract is not subject to automatic renewal or extension upon its scheduled expiration on January 13, 2011. It is possible that there will be an open competition for the next-generation MTS contract, known as MTS III. We believe that other existing and potential commercial and defense-related competitors, such as Viasat, Inc. (which was awarded the BFT-2 program contract), Qualcomm, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation and Lockheed Martin Corporation are developing or already have developed their own next-generation MTS III solution. Increased competition may adversely impact operating margins throughout the industry. We were informed by the U.S. Army that we lost the BFT-2 program because ViaSat, Inc. submitted a total evaluated price that was approximately 50% lower than our proposal. It is possible, that ViaSat, Inc. or another vendor may submit a similar lower priced proposal for MTS III. Also, as discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors
 section, the MTS and BFT programs may merge with each other and we may lose the MTS III competition. Ultimately, if competitors are awarded future contracts, or if our MTS contract is not renewed or extended, or if we fail to succeed in a re-compete process, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Future MTS revenues are dependent on the success of our research and development efforts – In the past several years, we have committed considerable research and development resources with a focus on designing and delivering backward compatible next-generation products and technology. Although we continue to work closely with the U.S. Army to provide additional enhancements to our network capabilities and communications performance and believe that we have and are developing new products that provide compelling technological advancement to our existing products and that are, importantly, backward compatible with the large number of existing MTS systems that have been previously shipped, it is possible that the U.S. Army will ultimately cease or reduce its ordering levels for our products and services which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Our current BFT-1 contract is nearing its expiration and we were not selected as the vendor for BFT-2 – Sales to the BFT-1 program in fiscal 2010 were approximately $53.6 million. Through July 31, 2010, we have received $262.8 million in total orders under our $384.0 million BFT-1 contract, which expires in December 2011. If we do not ultimately receive additional orders under the BFT-1 contract, it would have a material adverse effect on our business outlook. In July 2010 we were advised by the U.S. Army Contracting Command-CECOM Contracting Center that we were not selected as the vendor for the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below, Blue Force Tracking 2 (FBCB2-BFT-2) program. The announcement of this decision could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to secure the next-generation MTS III program and could ultimately adversely impact our future revenues and operating results in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments. Given the loss of the BFT-2 program contract, we expect annual BFT-1 revenues to eventually decline from current levels.   29   ·  Our MTS and BFT-1 revenues and related earnings are dependent on third-party products or components – A significant portion of our mobile data communications revenues in fiscal 2011 are expected to be derived from sales of ruggedized computers and leased satellite capacity. We purchase these and other products and services from third-party suppliers and incorporate them into our MTS and BFT-1 solutions which we sell to the U.S. Army. If the MTS ruggedized computers cannot be produced or are not delivered timely by the third-party supplier, or if actual field deployment schedules are delayed, our anticipated consolidated financial results would be adversely affected. Our profitability is also highly dependent on the ability of our satellite network providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. ·  Changes in U.S. Army plans, strategies and related programs may adversely impact us – Although we maintain an active dialogue with the U.S. Army, we are not privy to detailed and specific plans and strategies of the MTS or BFT-1 programs, which are subject to daily, if not constant, changes. The U.S. Army has stated that it intends to eventually converge onto a single mobile system configuration known as Joint Battle Command-Platform (“JBC-P”) with a goal of unifying tracking and battlefield situational awareness. JBC-P is intended for all U.S. military services (e.g., U.S. Army and U.S. Marines). As such, it is possible, that both the MTS and BFT programs could be combined into one or more other programs or be combined with each other which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Changes in U.S. Army procurement policies may result in material changes to our business – In order to maintain a competitive procurement process, the U.S. Army provides interested companies with information about its program plans; however, detailed program requirements and related strategic funding decisions are subject to daily, if not constant, change.  As such, it is difficult to predict the impact of policy decisions on future contract awards. The U.S. government announced a stated policy direction to reduce the number of sole-source contract awards across all procuring agencies. We are currently the sole source provider of the entire MTS system and it is possible that another vendor may be selected. In addition, a large portion of our revenues include the resale of third-party components, such as MTS ruggedized computers and satellite transponder time that we incorporate into our MTS and BFT-1 solutions. It is possible that, on future contracts, the government may provide these or other third-party components as government furnished equipment or procure services directly from such suppliers. As such, if we only win a portion of a future MTS contract award, our revenues and related earnings would significantly decline and our business outlook would be negatively impacted. Also, if we are required to provide the U.S. Army with government-purpose rights that would permit other companies, including our competitors, to use our technology to develop products for the U.S. government, our competitive position would be adversely affected. ·   A lack of reliable MTS and BFT-1 fielding information creates uncertainty in our business outlook – To date we have shipped approximately 44,000 MTS transceivers and 127,000 BFT-1 transceivers, including upgrades and replacements. However, we are not able to accurately determine how many of those units have been deployed in the field, or how many field units have ultimately been replaced because they were damaged or upgraded. In addition, both the MTS and BFT-1 program administrators do not share detailed fielding information with us which prevents us from accurately predicting their short-term or long-term needs. As such, the lack of reliable detailed and specific information about the U.S. Army’s deployed equipment and the actual number of vehicles or systems that are expected to be deployed and equipped with our products exposes us to the risk that our business outlook may be inaccurate. In addition, our business decisions based on incorrect assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·Because of the nature of future MTS revenues, our operating results are expected to be volatile – Our MTS ruggedized computers currently being shipped to the U.S. Army are manufactured by a third-party supplier and have significantly lower gross margins than prior MTS computers which were manufactured by a different supplier. We expect that nearly all new MTS systems sold to the U.S. Army for the foreseeable future will incorporate this new computer. As a result, gross margins in our mobile data communications segment in any particular future period will be highly influenced by the ultimate quantity of new MTS ruggedized computers shipped in those periods. Accordingly, our operating results in the future will be more volatile and it will be more difficult than in the past to accurately project gross margins and our related operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period.   30  ·  Our MTS and BFT-1 inventory could be excessive if we do not receive additional orders under our existing contracts or our MTS contract is not renewed or extended – We currently anticipate that we will continue to maintain a substantial inventory level in order to provide products to our customers on a timely basis. Certain components required in our production process have purchasing lead-times of four months or longer, and the delivery timetables on our contracts require us to provide products in shorter timeframes after we receive an order. We currently have approximately $9.3 million of inventory related to our MTS and BFT-1 contracts, substantially all of which relates to funded orders in our backlog at July 31, 2010. If we determine that this inventory will not be utilized or cannot be sold in excess of its net book value, we would be required to record a write-down of the value of such inventory in our consolidated financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charge could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period we make such determination. In addition, if forecasted orders are not received, or if we do not secure an MTS contract after its current expiration date of January 13, 2011, we may be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals that we would have to write-off and which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  We may incur material expenses if our MTS and BFT-1 networks experience downtime or fail – All satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service and our network systems occasionally experience downtime. Interruptions in service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should we be required to obtain or restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face increased risks associated with our strategies to grow revenues associated with our commercial satellite-based mobile data applications and microsatellite space applications.Although we believe that there may be opportunities to leverage our core strengths and expertise in satellite-based mobile tracking and messaging services into commercial market applications, to date commercial satellite-based mobile data applications have not been a material part of our business. Our future success in developing these markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to access effective distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which provide us a competitive advantage, and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Ultimately, we may have to acquire another company, increase our operating expenses and devote additional capital resources to be successful in these markets. In addition, as a result of our fiscal 2009 Radyne acquisition, we now offer both government and commercial customers the design and production of microsatellites that provide a portion of the functionality of expensive large satellites but at a fraction of the cost. We have established a modest position in this market. Although we continue to invest in marketing, sales and internal research and development efforts to establish a leadership position in this market, we may not be able to penetrate this market in a significant way.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will result in net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.   31  Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face a number of risks relating to the expected long-term growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to continue to manage this growth. These risks include: ·  The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements. Our expected long-term growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify. ·  We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.   32  Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition, restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated. For example, our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains the patent. If the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “;interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.  33  Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan.We have a committed $150.0 million, unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders that expires on January 31, 2014. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to incur debt, make certain payments (including dividends), repurchase shares of our common stock, sell certain assets, and make certain investments. It also requires us to maintain certain minimum levels of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) and does not allow us to permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to exceed certain ratios.  Our Credit Facility, as amended, also requires us to maintain $100.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, an incremental amount of Adjusted EBITDA, and also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted. If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (such as the payment of cash dividends on our common stock) and contain certain restrictions and covenants. We can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events, including a change in control. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance them. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.   34  Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:·  strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;·  issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;·  future announcements concerning us or our competitors;·  receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;·  quality deficiencies in services or products;·  results of technological innovations;·  new commercial products;·  changes in recommendations of securities analysts;·  government regulations;·  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;·  changes in U.S. government policies;·  changes related to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan;·  changes in the status of our MTS and BFT-1 contracts or announcement of a future MTS III award;·  changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;·  changes in securities market conditions, generally;·  changes in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);·  energy blackouts;·  acts of terrorism or war;·  inflation or deflation; and·  rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.   35  We have been named as a party in three pending purported class action lawsuits which may require significant management time and attention and, if adversely determined, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have been sued in two nearly identical purported class action lawsuits (Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters’ Retirement System, etc., v. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. et al., 09 Civ. 3007 (SJF/AKT) and Lawing v. Comtech Telecommunications Corp., 09 Civ. 3182 (JFB)), both filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Complaints”). Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also named as defendants. The Complaints, filed in July 2009, allege that we violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making materially false and misleading statements with respect to revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal year 2009. The plaintiffs purport to sue on behalf of purchasers of our stock between September 17, 2008 and March 9, 2009. The essence of the Complaints is that we allegedly failed to disclose certain adverse facts that were allegedly known to exist at the time we issued the revenue and earnings guidance at issue in the Complaints. We have, to date, only been served with a complaint by the Pompano Beach Police and Firefighters’ Retirement System (“Pompano Beach”). On September 10, 2009, the District Court entered a scheduling order in the Pompano Beach lawsuit, and pursuant to that order, Pompano Beach filed a motion seeking consolidation of the two related actions and appointment as lead plaintiff under the procedure set out in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  On August 17, 2010, the magistrate judge assigned to the matter recommended that this motion, which was unopposed, be granted.  We believe the case has no merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and our officers in this action. Although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict, we believe that the final outcome of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.We are also named in a putative stockholder class action complaint that was filed against us, CPI International and the members of the CPI International board of directors, in the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, entitled Continuum Capital v. Michael Targoff, et al. (Case No. 110CV175940). The lawsuit concerns the proposed merger between us and CPI, that was terminated on September 7, 2010, and generally asserts claims alleging, among other things, that each member of CPI’s board of directors breached his fiduciary duties by agreeing to the terms of the proposed merger and by failing to provide stockholders with allegedly material information related to the proposed merger, and that we aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty allegedly committed by the members of CPI’s board of directors. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, class action certification and monetary relief. On July 28, 2010, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, making generally the same claims against the same defendants, and seeking the same relief. In addition, the amended complaint generally alleges that the consideration to be paid to CPI International’s stockholders under the terms of the proposed merger is inadequate. We believe all claims asserted in the lawsuit to be without merit, and we believe that the final outcome of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.  36 "
14,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2009-09-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology suchas “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” the negative of these terms, or other similar words or comparable terminology. All statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking information. When considering forward-looking statements,you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our business outlook, actualfinancial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Our Fiscal 2009 acquisition of Radyne Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Radyne”) may ultimately not prove successful and we may not continue to realize anticipated benefits from this acquisition.During fiscal 2009, we completed our acquisition restructuring plan related to our August 1, 2008 acquisition of Radyne. In less than one year, we achieved operating efficiencies by eliminating redundant functions and related expenses by, among other things, vacating Radyne’s Phoenix, Arizona manufacturing facility, fully integratingRadyne’s satellite earth station product line’s manufacturing and engineering operations into our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and moving Radyne’s corporate functions to our Melville, New York corporate headquarters. Although we expect to continue to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the Radyne acquisition, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. In particular,the ongoing success of the Radyne acquisition will depend on maintaining the efficiencies and cost savings we have achieved to date, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to do so.The Radyne acquisition significantly expanded the types of products that we sell and the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges including managing the substantial increase in the scale of our operations resulting from the acquisition. During fiscal 2009, we integrated a largenumber of systems, both operational and administrative and we made personnel reductions and changes. We continue to test, make changes to and refine internal controls relating to Radyne, most notably in the area of ITAR compliance. As such, our management excluded the related controls and procedures of Radyne from its assessment of disclosure controls and procedures as well as from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. Although we cannot be certain of our ability to do so, we believe thatappropriate testing and refinement of our controls and procedures will be completed during fiscal 2010. The diversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.  Future acquisitions and investments may divert our resources and management attention, and the benefits from such acquisitions and investments may fall short of expectations. We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions or investments in businesses, technologies and product lines. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of additional debt, increases to amortization expenses and the future write-offof intangibles acquired. Such acquisitions or investments may also conflict with our $100.0 million three-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”), thereby limiting our ability to draw on the Credit Facility or requiring us to repay the Credit Facility. Acquisitions involve other operational risks, including:·  difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business; ·  diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and·  increased expenses associated with acquired businesses including managing the growth of such businesses.There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions and investments will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  19  Our business outlook is subject to a number of risks relating to the current economic climate.Overall business conditions continue to be challenging and commercial markets remain soft. Nearly all businesses and governments around the world have been facing, and are continuing to face, capital and operating budget constraints and a much tighter credit environment. None of our three operating segments have been immune to these challengingconditions and each continues to face an uncertain economic environment. These challenging conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:·  Difficulty in forecasting our results of operations – It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity, or the duration, of the current challenging economicenvironment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate. ·  Additional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur – Prior to fiscal 2009, the U.S. and global economies were growing and our revenues and profits increased as our customers increased their spending on telecommunications equipmentand systems. However, our businesses have been negatively affected in the past by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. During 2009, our customers appeared to have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases, postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of the current global economic environment, our customers may further reduce their spending on telecommunicationsequipment and systems. As a consequence, it is possible that our bookings in fiscal 2010 will not meet or exceed the levels experienced in fiscal 2009. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.·  Our customers may not be able to obtain financing – Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales areaffected by the ability of customers to obtain the substantial financing they require to build out their networks, fund operations and ultimately make purchases from us. The inability of those customers to obtain sufficient credit would adversely affect our revenues. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.·  Our ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult – In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk.Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain and might require higher deductibles than in the past. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain adequate credit insurance consistent with our past practices.Our operating results are difficult to forecast, subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile. We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share from period-to-period. For instance, a large portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifier segments’ net sales are derivedfrom products such as satellite earth station equipment and satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers, respectively, that generally have short-lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand. The remaining portion of our telecommunications transmission and our RF microwave amplifiers segments’ net sales are generally derived from large contracts or military program opportunities that are subject tolengthy sales cycles and therefore difficult to predict. In addition, almost all of our net sales and orders from our mobile data communications segment are derived from our MTS and BFT IDIQ contracts which are subject to contract ceilings, unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. Our new orders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, also may vary significantly from period-to-period because of other factors including: the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions; product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; price competition;new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general economic conditions.  20  Changes in government policy, including changes in U.S. policies relating to Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse effect on us.In recent years, we have benefited from increased Department of Defense spending relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue. During fiscal 2009, the new U.S. presidential administration announced and began implementing new policies related to Iraq and Afghanistan.These changes included a formally announced troop withdrawal timetable from Iraq with a simultaneous limited troop build-up in Afghanistan. We believe recent policy changes resulted in order delays while U.S. Army personnel began implementing such changes.  The ultimate implementation of these policies or future changes in these or other policies (such as changes in U.S. health care policy) or priorities could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. A shifting political environmentmakes it more difficult than usual to estimate our future income and expenses. The future direction of the political environment including potential changes in policies relating to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war could have a material adverse effect on us.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ responses thereto, and threats of war could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affectthe availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers.Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to maintain current levels of U.S. government business.In recent years, we have increased our dependence on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately 56.4%, 66.4% and 61.3% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Approximately89.6% of our backlog at July 31, 2009 consisted of orders from U.S. government contracts, U.S. government subcontracts and U.S. government funded programs and we expect such business to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. Our U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including: ·  unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions; ·  unpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations; ·  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities; ·  penalties arising from post-award contract audits or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced; ·  higher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and ·  unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government approval of final indirect rates. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government’s right to terminate,U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding canimpact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. Also, we obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that the contracts we are awarded will ultimately be profitable.  21  Noncompliance with numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions (including those pertaining to income taxes) could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business operations are primarily located in the U.S., however, we must comply with domestic and international laws, regulations and restrictions. Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”),as well as similar international laws and regulations. Because the laws and regulations pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following: ·  We could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government – As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations,including those governing security and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes fordisqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-relatedcosts and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us, and if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us. As discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, we could be adversely affected by the results of an ongoing review by the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Department of State of our compliance efforts with regard to export regulations. ·  Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products – Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards andspecifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequenciesfor other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicablelaws and regulations could materially harm our business. ·  New recycling regulations may significantly increase our costs – The European Union (“EU”) has adopted two directives to facilitatethe recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which directs EU member states to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally sound disposal of certain products placed on the market after August 13, 2005, and from products in use prior to thatdate that are being replaced. The EU has also adopted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the EU after July 1, 2006. Similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions, including in the U.S., China and Japan. Other environmental regulations may requireus to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible, and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us. There can be no assurance that such existing or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business.   22  ·  We may be subject to environmental liabilities – We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmentalregulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, such as the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our Comtech Antenna Systems, Inc. subsidiary. We are also subject to the RoHS directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the impositionof substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse impact onour business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Ongoing tax audits could result in a material tax assessment – Our U.S., state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Significantjudgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Our fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 federal income tax returns were recently audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and our fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS. Other returns may be selected for auditin the future. Although adjustments relating to our fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 tax returns were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2007, and other periods that may be selected for future audit, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our Radyne acquisition, could be impaired as a result of future business conditions or if we change our reporting unit structure. We have goodwill and intangible assets of $204.5 million recorded on our balance sheet as of July 31, 2009. For purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill, each of our three operating segments constitutes a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factorsin determining the fair values of the reporting unit. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and is based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer manages the business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our future reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. We generally perform an annual impairment review in the first quarter of each fiscal year or when there are indicatorsof impairments, such as a significant adverse change that could impact our future financial performance. Although we performed our fiscal 2010 impairment testing on August 1, 2009 and we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill, changes in our future operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill in future periods which could be material to our results of operations. In addition, if we are not successful in maintaining operating efficienciesassociated with our Radyne acquisition, our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future, could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.All of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change requiring us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.We are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies such as TDMA-based technologies and the emergence of new industry standardssuch as WiMAX could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal research and development or acquisitions of businesses or licenses, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in suchefforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains a patent. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smallercompetitors or new firms, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  23  Ongoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.Because we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:·  If we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs will unexpectedly increase – Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a reportof management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. Our report for fiscal 2009 excludes our assessment of Radyne.We are required to include Radyne in our fiscal 2010 report. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance including weaknesses and controls relating to Radyne. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publiclytraded companies. ·  Stock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock – Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. Webelieve that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. In fiscal 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards usinga fair value method. The adoption of the new standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive togrant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Changes in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs – The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increasedcosts and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement that we must file our financial statements with the SEC using the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as “XBRL”) and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). We may have to add additional accounting staff, engageconsultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with XBRL and IFRS requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liabilitycoverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.   24  We could be adversely affected by the results of an ongoing State Department review of our compliance efforts with regard to export regulations.As a result of a customs export enforcement subpoena that our Florida-based subsidiary, Comtech Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) first received in October 2007 from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) branch of the Department of Homeland Security (“Homeland Security”), the Enforcement Division ofthe U.S. Department of State (“State Department”) informed us that it sought to confirm our company-wide International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) compliance for the five-year period ended March 2008.Since the original receipt of the ICE subpoena, we have engaged outside counsel and export consultants to investigate the matters relating to the ICE subpoena and help us assess and improve, as appropriate, our internal controls with respect to export-related laws and regulations, including ITAR, Export Administration Regulations and lawsgoverning record keeping and dealings with foreign representatives. We have provided detailed information and a summary of our findings to the U.S. Department of State. Our findings to date indicate that there were certain instances of exports and defense services during the five-year period for which we did not have the appropriate authorization from the U.S. Department of State. We continue to find areas and opportunities for improving our procedures to comply with laws and regulations relating to exports,including at our newly acquired Radyne subsidiaries. Violations discovered by us as part of our internal control assessment, including those by Radyne that occurred prior to August 1, 2008 (the date we acquired Radyne), have been reported to the U.S. Department of State.To date, we have accrued for and paid fines relating to our export violations. We are continuing to assess our export control process including implementing enhanced formal company-wide ITAR control procedures at our newly acquired Radyne subsidiaries. Because our assessments are continuing, we expect to continue to remediate, improve andenhance our internal controls relating to exports. Because the above State Department matters are ongoing, we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of those matters. Violations of U.S. export control-related laws and regulations could result in additional civil or criminal fines and/or penalties and/or result in an injunction against us, all of which could, in the aggregate, materially impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. Should we identify a material weakness relating to our compliance,the ongoing costs of remediation could be material.Our dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks, including U.S. export restrictions.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 32.1%, 26.7% and 26.2% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and we expect that international saleswill continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take stepsto mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others: ·  We may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk – We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestonepayments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relatingto termination at the convenience of the government.·  We rely on a limited number of international sales agents – In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respectto sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or thetermination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.  25  ·  We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government – Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of ourproducts are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses and failureto obtain required licenses would adversely affect our sales outside the U.S.We have significant operations in Florida, California and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems at two facilities located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past. Our RF microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, close tomajor earthquake fault lines.Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s network operations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons,tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.In the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse impact on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In recent years, we have increased the company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segmentwere $53.0 million, $123.8 million and $78.3 million, respectively. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segment were $14.6 million, $16.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. We intend to continue to increase our company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology manufacturing center. We also intend to continue to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. If a natural disasteror other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities, and as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse impact on all three of our business segments, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these or other government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfillingorders from our customers. In addition, our backlog as of July 31, 2009 includes orders for a significant amount of MTS ruggedized computers that we expect to ship in fiscal 2010. We purchase these ruggedized computers from a single-sourced third-party supplier. Although nominal shipments have occurred, we are aware that our third-party supplier has had and continues to have minor and configuration-type production issues as they are preparing for full-scale production. We believe these issues will be resolvedduring the first half of our fiscal 2010. If these computers cannot be produced or are not delivered timely by the third-party supplier, or if actual field deployment schedules are delayed, our 2010 business outlook would be adversely affected.  26  A substantial majority of our sales have historically come from, and are expected to be derived in the future from sales relating to our MTS and BFT contracts. Our MTS and BFT contracts and related business activities are subject to a number of unique risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us. In addition to the other risks described in this section, the risks applicable to our MTS and BFT business include the following: ·  Our MTS and BFT contracts are IDIQ contracts and can be terminated at any time – Our mobile data communications segment’s revenues and profits are primarily derived from our MTS and BFT contracts. Ourtelecommunications transmission segment’s operating results are impacted positively or negatively by the amount of MTS and BFT orders received because it manufactures our MTS and BFT satellite transceivers. Both of these contracts can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions by the U.S. government. Because both of these contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, the U.S. Army is not obligatedto purchase any equipment or services under these contracts. If such contracts are terminated or if MTS and BFT revenues decline, operating results in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments will be adversely affected. ·  Our current MTS and BFT contracts are currently near ceiling limits – Through July 31, 2009, we have received $546.3 million in total orders under our $605.1 million MTS contract, which expires in July 2010,and $211.3 million in total orders under our $216.0 million BFT contract, which expires in December 2011. Given the current contract ceiling levels related to our MTS and BFT contracts, we cannot obtain large future MTS or BFT orders unless the respective programs increase our contract ceilings, issue contract extensions or award us new contracts. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately receive a contract ceiling increase, contract extension or be awarded a new contract. ·  Competition for next-generation MTS and BFT contracts is increasing – Our MTS and BFT contracts are not subject to automatic renewal or extension upon their scheduled expiration on July 12, 2010 and December31, 2011, respectively. We expect competition for our MTS and BFT contracts to increase. In fiscal 2007, the BFT program’s prime contractor, Northrop Grumman Corporation, awarded a contract to ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”) to develop a new prototype network and related equipment to increase network capacity for the U.S. Army’s BFT tracking system. In March 2009, ViaSat announced that it received an initial production order from the U.S. Army for its next-generation BFT transceivers. We believethat other existing and potential commercial and defense-related competitors, such as Qualcomm, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation and Lockheed Martin Corporation are developing or already have developed their own next-generation MTS and BFT solutions. Increased competition may adversely impact operating margins throughout the industry. Ultimately, if competitors are awarded future contracts, or if one or both of our contracts are not renewed or extended, or if we fail to succeed in a re-compete process, it wouldhave a material adverse impact on our business. ·  Future MTS and BFT revenues are dependent on the success of our research and development efforts – In the past several years, we have committed considerable research and development resources with a focus ondesigning and delivering backward compatible next-generation MTS and BFT products and technology. Although we continue to work closely with the U.S. Army to provide additional enhancements to our network capabilities and communications performance and believe that we have and are developing new products that provide compelling technological advancement to our existing products and that are, importantly, backward compatible with the large number of existing BFT and MTS systems that have been previously shipped,it is possible that the U.S. Army will ultimately cease or reduce its ordering levels for our products and services which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. ·  Our MTS and BFT revenues and related earnings are dependent on third-party products or components – A substantial portion of our mobile data communications revenues in fiscal 2010 are expected to be derivedfrom sales of ruggedized computers and leased satellite capacity. We purchase these products from third-party suppliers and incorporate them into our MTS and BFT solutions which we sell to the U.S. Army. If the MTS ruggedized computers cannot be produced or are not delivered timely by the third-party supplier, or if actual field deployment schedules are delayed, our anticipated consolidated financial results would be adversely affected. Our profitability is also highly dependent on the ability of our satellitenetwork providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.   27  ·  Changes in U.S. Army plans, strategies and related programs may adversely impact us – Although we maintain an active dialogue with the U.S. Army, we are not privy to detailed and specific plans and strategiesof the MTS or BFT programs, which are subject to daily, if not constant, changes. The U.S. Army has stated that it eventually intends to converge onto a single mobile system configuration known as Joint Battle Command-Platform (“JBC-P”) with a goal of unifying tracking and battlefield situational awareness. JBC-P is intended for all U.S. military services (e.g., U.S. Army and U.S. Marines). As such, it is possible, that both our MTS and BFT programs could be combined into one or more other programsor be combined with each other. Our next-generation MTS and BFT solutions have been designed with this overall goal in mind and we believe it can enable the U.S. Army to gradually transition and migrate to JBC-P. If our next-generation solutions do not meet the U.S. Army’s operational needs or strategic objectives or if the U.S. Army makes strategic fielding plan changes that we are unable to address, it would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. ·  Changes in U.S. Army procurement policies may result in material changes to our business – During fiscal 2009, the U.S. government announced a stated policy direction to reduce the number of sole-source contractawards across all procuring agencies. In April 2009, the U.S. Army released a Market Survey seeking sources for Blue Force Tracking-2 or “BFT2,” the U.S. Army’s next-generation BFT system. This Market Survey indicated that the U.S. Army may issue multiple IDIQ contract awards and that it desires government-purpose rights upon a contract award. It is possible that the MTS program has similar desires and that it may ultimately award multiple IDIQ contracts as well. We are currently the sole sourceprovider of the entire MTS system and we believe we are the current sole source provider of BFT mobile satellite transceivers and related satellite network services. In addition, a large portion of our revenues include the resale of third-party components, such as MTS ruggedized computers and satellite transponder time that we incorporate into our MTS and BFT solutions. It is possible that, on future contracts, the government may provide these or other third-party components as government furnished equipmentor procure services directly from such suppliers. As such, if we only win a portion of future MTS and BFT contract awards, our revenues and related earnings would significantly decline and our business outlook would be negatively impacted. Also, if we are required to provide the U.S. Army with government-purpose rights that would permit other companies, including our competitors, to use our technology to develop products for the U.S. government, our competitive position would be adversely affected.·  A lack of reliable MTS and BFT fielding information creates uncertainty regarding our business outlook – To date, we have shipped approximately 38,000 MTS transceivers and 122,000 BFT transceivers, includingupgrades and replacements. However, we are not able to accurately determine how many of those units have been deployed in the field, or how many field units have ultimately been replaced because they were damaged or upgraded. In addition, both the MTS and BFT program administrators do not share detailed fielding information with us which prevents us from accurately predicting their short-term or long-term needs. For instance, we believe the U.S. Army’s current total authorized requirement for MTS systemsis approximately 51,000 and that a stated budgetary “good enough fielding” goal is approximately 24,500. However, in February 2009, the U.S. Army stated that their objectives include providing an interoperable, scalable and upgraded solution for the MTS program that focuses on a user-friendly interface with a network architecture that is scalable to over 100,000 users. The U.S. Army has also stated that it anticipates replacing existing BFT equipment with new and improved mobile satellite transceiversand satellite ground station hub and network operations center equipment. The U.S. Army has stated that it expects to purchase 100,000 next-generation transceivers for BFT during the 2010-2015 timeframe. As such, the lack of reliable detailed and specific information about the U.S. Army’s deployed equipment and the actual number of vehicles or systems that are expected to be deployed and equipped with our products exposes us to the risk that our business outlook may be inaccurate. In addition, our businessdecisions based on incorrect assumptions could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. ·  Because of the nature of future MTS revenues, our operating results are expected to be volatile– The new MTS ruggedized computers selected by the U.S. Army are manufactured by a third-party supplier and havesignificantly lower gross margins than prior MTS computers which were manufactured by a different supplier. We expect that nearly all new MTS systems sold to the U.S. Army for the foreseeable future will incorporate this new computer. As a result, gross margins in our mobile data communications segment in the future will significantly decline as compared to earlier periods and gross margins in any particular future period will be highly influenced by the ultimate quantity of new MTS ruggedized computers shippedin those periods. Accordingly, our operating results in the future will be more volatile and it will be more difficult than in the past to accurately project gross margins and our related operating income, net income and earnings per share in any particular future period.  28  ·  Our MTS and BFT inventories could be excessive if our contracts are not renewed – We currently anticipate that we will continue to maintain a substantial inventory level in order to provide products to ourcustomers on a timely basis. Certain components required in our production process have purchasing lead-times of four months or longer, and the delivery timetables on our contracts require us to provide products in shorter timeframes after we receive an order. We currently have approximately $16.8 million of inventory related to our MTS and BFT customers, including $5.1 million of older ruggedized MTS computers and related accessories. The U.S. Army has selected a new ruggedized MTS computer model which is intendedto provide hardware commonality with other U.S. Army programs. Although we have sold the older version MTS computer model to the U.S. Army since their selection of a new ruggedized MTS computer, we believe demand for the older ruggedized computers that we currently have in inventory will decline. Although we continue to actively market the older ruggedized computers and related components to the U.S. Army and other prospective customers such as the Army National Guard and NATO, if we determine that this inventorywill not be utilized or cannot be sold in excess of its net book value, we would be required to record a write-down of the value of such inventory in our consolidated financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charge could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period we make such determination. In addition, if forecasted orders are not received, or if we do not secure MTS and BFT contracts after their current expiration dates, we may be left with large inventoriesof slow moving or unusable parts or terminals that we would have to write-off and which would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  We may incur material expenses if our MTS and BFT networks experience downtime or fail – All satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disastermay interrupt service and our network systems occasionally experience downtime. Interruptions in service could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should we be required to obtain or restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face increased risks associated with our strategies to grow revenues associated with our commercial satellite-based mobile data applications and microsatellite space applications.Although we believe that there may be opportunities to leverage our core strengths and expertise in satellite-based mobile tracking and messaging services into commercial market applications, to date commercial satellite-based mobile data applications have not been a material part of our business. Our future success in developing these markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to access effective distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which provide us a competitive advantage, and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Ultimately, we may have to increase our operating expensesand devote additional capital resources to be successful in these markets.In addition, as a result of our Radyne acquisition, we now offer both government and commercial customers the design and production of microsatellites that provide a portion of the functionality of expensive large satellites but at a fraction of the cost. We have established a modest position in this market. Although we continue to investin marketing, sales and internal research and development efforts to establish a leadership position in this market, we may not be able to penetrate this market in a significant way. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We can give no assurance that our backlog will resultin net sales. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which casewe may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.  29  Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks. A substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billedto the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of fundingfrom the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face a number of risks relating to the recent and anticipated growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to continue to manage this growth.  These risks include: ·  The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business – Our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including the key corporateand operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers at our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements. Our growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations isintense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify. ·  We may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth – Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue to place,significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not ableto timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ·  Our markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success – Themarkets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developingcountries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.   30  Protection of our intellectual property is limited and we are subject to the risk that third parties may claim our products or systems infringe their intellectual property rights. Our businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights as competitors routinely develop similar but non-infringing products. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition,restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property.The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfullyand achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated. For example, our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidthcompression technology is licensed by us from a third party who maintains the patent. If the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party and/or our customers who have incorporated our products into their systems or businesses. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our businesspractices, we could be prohibited from making and selling some of our products or providing certain telecommunications services. As discussed in the caption entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (15)(c) Legal Proceedings and Other Matters” included in “Part II — Item 8 — Financial Statements andSupplementary Data,” one of our customers has requested that we indemnify them for any losses sustained or legal costs incurred as a result of a patent infringement-related lawsuit against them. Although we do not believe we are contractually obligated to indemnify the customer and have denied their indemnity and defense request, we are working with the customer to defend the lawsuit. We have intervened in the case and have begun to participate in discovery and expert reports. Ultimately, if we arefound liable for losses sustained or legal costs incurred by our customer, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period of such determination. Provisions in our corporate documents, stockholder rights plan, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech and we may adopt a new stockholder rights plan upon its current expiration. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and agreements with other of our executive officersprovide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. We also adopted a stockholder rights plan, that currently expires December 15, 2009, that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors (“Board”). We may extend our existing stockholder rights plan or adopt a new stockholder rights plan upon the expirationof the current plan. Our rights plan could prevent us from being acquired. In addition, our certificate of incorporation grants our Board the authority to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of and issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock, such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stockcould have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or which could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of Comtech. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after thedate of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years didown, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.   31  Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions that could limit our ability to implement our business plan.Because of the disruption in the overall credit markets that occurred in fiscal 2009 and the resulting inability of many companies to access credit, in June 2009, we entered into a committed $100.0 million three-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of bank lenders. The Credit Facilitycontains certain covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to incur debt, make certain payments (including dividends), repurchase shares of common stock of the Company, sell certain assets, and make certain investments. It also requires certain minimum levels of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) and does not allow us to permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to exceed certain ratios.The Credit Facility also contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments, failure to perform or observe terms, or a change of control (as defined in the agreement). If an event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings, if any, to beimmediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain strategic transactions. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants contained in our Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility may be restricted.If we have significant borrowings under the agreement and we violate a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. In the future, we may not be able toobtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. In May 2009, we increased the level of our indebtedness as a result of the issuance of $200.0 million of our 3.0% convertible senior notes. Our 3.0% convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date,subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Our 3.0% convertible senior notes contain certain restrictions and covenants and we can provide no assurances that we will not default on these or other debt obligations.We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the 3.0% convertible senior notes on or after May 5, 2014. Holders of the 3.0% convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 3.0% convertible senior notes, solely for cash, on May 1, 2014, May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2024 and upon certain events,including a change in control. If not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders’ right to require repurchase, the 3.0% convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2029. If the holders of our 3.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes that they own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the 3.0% convertible senior notes or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available topay or refinance them.The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reactingto, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.    32  Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantlyin the future as well.Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include, among others:·  strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;·  issuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;·  future announcements concerning us or our competitors;·  receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;·  quality deficiencies in services or products;·  results of technological innovations;·  new commercial products;·  changes in recommendations of securities analysts;·  government regulations;·  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;·  changes in U.S. government policies;·  changes related to the ongoing military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan;·  changes in the status of our MTS and BFT contracts;·  changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;·  changes in securities market conditions, generally;·  changes in the status of litigation;·  changes in the status of our export matters;·  energy blackouts;·  acts of terrorism or war;·  inflation or deflation; and·  rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We have been named as a party in two pending purported class action lawsuits which may require significant management time and attention and, if adversely determined, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have been sued in two nearly identical purported class action lawsuits (Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters’ Retirement System, etc., v. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. et al.,  09 Civ. 3007 (SJF/AKT) and Lawingv. Comtech Telecommunications Corp., 09 Civ. 3182 (JFB)), both filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Complaints”). Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also named as defendants. The Complaints, filed in July 2009, allege that we violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making materially false and misleading statements with respect to revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal year 2009. The plaintiffspurport to sue on behalf of purchasers of our stock between September 17, 2008 and March 9, 2009. The essence of the Complaints is that we allegedly failed to disclose certain adverse facts that were allegedly known to exist at the time we issued the revenue and earnings guidance at issue in the Complaints. We and our two officers, to date, have only been served with a complaint by the Pompano Beach Police and Firefighters’ Retirement System. No other pleadings have been filed and no proceedings have takenplace. We believe the case has no merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and our officers in this action. Although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict, class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.   33 "
13,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2008-09-17,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS     Forward-LookingStatements This Form10-K contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning thefuture of our industry, product development, business strategy, continuedacceptance of our products, market growth, and dependence on significantcustomers.  These statements can be identified by the use offorward-looking terminology such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,”“continue,” or other similar words. When considering forward-looking statements,you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in thisForm 10-K.  However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not theonly risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently knownto us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materiallyadversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results inthe future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout thisForm 10-K could cause our actual financial condition or results to differsignificantly from those contained in any forward-lookingstatement.Ourrecent acquisition of Radyne Corporation (“Radyne”) may not be successful and wemay not realize anticipated benefits from this acquisition. The Radyneacquisition may divert our resources and management attention and our operatingresults may fall short of expectations. On August1, 2008 (the beginning of our fiscal year 2009), we purchased Radyne using aportion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for a preliminary aggregatepurchase price of approximately $231.7 million. Although we expect to realizestrategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the Radyneacquisition, we cannot assure whether and to what extent such benefits will beachieved. In particular, the success of the Radyne acquisition will depend, inpart, on our ability to realize anticipated efficiencies and cost savings,primarily through the elimination of redundant functions and the integration ofcertain operations. No assurances can be given that we will be able to achievethese efficiencies and cost savings. 15 Radynehas a history of inconsistent operating results and missing expectations and wewill face operational and administrative challenges as we work to integrateRadyne’s operations into our business. In particular, the Radyne acquisition hassignificantly expanded the types of products that we sell, expanded thebusinesses with which we are engaged in, as well as increased the number of ouremployees and the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us withsignificant challenges as we will need to manage the substantial increase inscale resulting from the acquisition. We must integrate a large number ofsystems, both operational and administrative. Delays in the process could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Ultimately, we may not be successful.Thediversion of our management’s attention to these matters and away from otherbusiness concerns could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults may fall short of expectations.Futureacquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and managementattention, results may fall short of expectations and, as a result, ouroperating results may be difficult to forecast and may be volatile. We intendto continue pursuing acquisitions of investments in businesses, technologies andproduct lines as a key component of our growth strategy. Any future acquisitionsor investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentiallydilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt and amortizationexpenses or in-process research and development charges related to intangiblesassets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:·  difficulties      in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel      of an acquired business;·  diversion      of management’s attention from other business  concerns;·  increased      expenses associated with the acquisition;and·  loss      of key employees or customers of any acquired  business.We cannotassure you that our future acquisitions will be successful and will notadversely affect our business, results of operations or financialcondition.Dueto many factors, including the Radyne acquisition and the amount of businessrepresented by large contracts, our operating results are difficult to forecastand may be volatile. We haveexperienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in neworders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earningsper share, from quarter-to-quarter. One reason for this is that a significantportion of our business — primarily the over-the-horizon microwave systems ofour telecommunications transmission segment, our RF microwave amplifiers segmentand our mobile data communications segment — is derived from a limited number ofrelatively large customer contracts, the timing of which cannot bepredicted. Our neworders, net sales and operating results, including our net income and earningsper share, also may vary significantly from period-to-period because of thefollowing factors: the financial performance of acquisitions; product mix sold;fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by ourcompetitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changesin delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatorydevelopments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expectedvolatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount ofstock-based compensation expense we may record); and general economicconditions. Inaddition, on August 1, 2008, as a result of our acquisition of Radyne there willbe a significant change to our future financial performance. Accordingly, youshould not rely on period-to-period comparisons as indications of our futureperformance because these comparisons may not be meaningful.  16 Ourbusiness, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depend on ourability to maintain our level of U.S. government business. In recentyears, we have increased our dependence on U.S. government business. Our salesto the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S.government) accounted for approximately 66.4%, 61.3% and 47.3% of ourconsolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,respectively. Approximately 71.5% of our backlog at July 31, 2008 consisted oforders from the U.S. government. Radyne’s business and net sales were alsosignificantly dependent on the business it received from the U.S.government. We expectsuch business to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net salesfor the foreseeable future. U.S. government business exposes us to variousrisks, including: ·  unexpected      contract or project terminations orsuspensions; ·  unpredictable      order placements, reductions orcancellations; ·  reductions      in government funds available for our projects due to government policy      changes, budget cuts and other spending  priorities; ·  penalties      arising from post-award contractaudits; ·  cost      audits in which the value of our contracts may be  reduced; ·  higher-than-expected      final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development,      for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries      for a fixed price; and ·  unpredictable      cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance      of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out      procedures, including government approval of final indirect      rates. All ofour U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for itsconvenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for ourrecovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on workcompleted prior to termination. In addition to the right of the U.S. governmentto terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuingapproval by Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriatesfunds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contractperformance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of amajor program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies arenormally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made byCongress for future fiscal years. We obtainU.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We cannotassure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or thatawarded contracts will generate sufficient net sales to result inprofitability. Ifwe are unable to comply with complex U.S. government regulations governingsecurity and contracting practices, we could be disqualified as a supplier tothe U.S government. As asupplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations,including those governing security and contracting practices. Failure to complywith these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines beingimposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility forbidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified asa supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S.government customers and revenues from sales of our products would declinesignificantly. Among the potential causes for disqualification are violations ofvarious statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, exportcontrol, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protectionof the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of costs, and foreigncorruption. The government could investigate and make inquiries of our businesspractices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting. Basedon the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust ourcontract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits andinvestigations, the government could make claims against us, and if it were toprevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.  17 We could be adversely affected by theresults of ongoing investigations into our compliance with exportregulations.InOctober 2007, our Florida-based subsidiary, Comtech Systems, Inc. (“CSI”),received a customs export enforcement subpoena from the U.S. Immigration andCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) branch of the Department of Homeland Security. Thesubpoena relates to CSI’s $2.0 million contract with the Brazilian NavalCommission (the Brazil contract) and it required the production of all books,records and documents, including copies of contracts, invoices and paymentsrelated to agreements between CSI, its agent, its subcontractor and theBrazilian government. We believe that the ICE investigation is focused primarilyon whether or not CSI was in compliance with export-related laws andregulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”)and the Export Administration Regulations. CSI produced documents in response tothe subpoena request. Customsofficials have detained certain inventory related to the Brazil contract pendingresolution of this matter.We engaged outside counsel to assist CSIin its response to the subpoena and related matters and to conduct our owninvestigation. Based on our ongoing investigation into this matter, webelieve that the detained inventory, which consists of commercial satelliteequipment, was not modified or adapted in any way to meet Brazilian militaryrequirements and was only subject to the jurisdiction of the Department ofCommerce and not the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State. In addition,in order to provide certain defense services, including conducting factoryacceptance testing at CSI’s Florida facility, we obtained a license (referred toas a Technical Assistance Agreement (“TAA”)) from the U.S. Department of State.We believe that the TAA authorized all activities under the Brazil contract thatwere subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State.Webelieve that CSI made a good faith effort to comply with applicable regulations;however, we believe that CSI made inadvertent administrative errors resulting ina TAA that did not become effective on a timely basis. The administrative errorsrelate primarily to the execution of non-disclosure agreements (“NDA”) withcertain third country national employees of CSI’s agent. These individuals havenow signed appropriate NDAs, and, in December 2007, CSI filed an amended TAAwith the U.S. Department of State. CSI has requested that the U.S. Department ofState confirm CSI’s and our view that the Brazil contract does not require anyother State Department license.In March2008, the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Department of State informed us thatthey were reviewing our amended TAA. In May 2008, the U.S.Attorney’s Office in the Middle District ofFlorida informed us that, based on its conversations with the ICE agent whoinitiated the subpoena, it was closing its investigation into the Brazil matter.In June 2008, the ICE agent informed us that he would recommend that thedetained inventory be released back to us upon the U.S. Department of Stateconfirming our position that a State Department license for the hardware shippedwas not required. In August2008, the ICE agent informed us that the U.S. Department of State wantedto clarify certain technical matters and, on its behalf, the ICE agent was goingto interview one of our engineers.This interviewoccurred in September of 2008. We continue to remain cautiouslyoptimistic that we will be able to shortly reship the Brazil inventory to ourcustomer.Inaddition to their review of the Brazil contract, in March 2008, the EnforcementDivision of the U.S. Department of State informed us that they sought to confirmour company-wide ITAR compliance for the five-year period ended March 2008. Inresponse, we expanded the scope of our own investigation. In June 2008, weprovided detailed information and a summary of our findings to the U.S.Department of State. In July 2008, the U.S. Department of State requestedsupplemental information and we responded to their request. Our findings to dateindicate that there were certain instances of exports and defense servicesduring the five-year period for which we did not have the appropriateauthorization from the U.S. Department of State; however, none of thoseinstances involved Proscribed Countries as defined by ITAR. We are awaitingadditional feedback from the U.S. Department of State as itrelates to all of the aforementioned matters.Since thereceipt of the original Brazil subpoena in October 2007, we have engaged outsidecounsel and export consultants to help us assess and improve, as appropriate,our internal controls with respect to U.S. export controls laws and regulationsand laws governing record keepingand dealings with foreign representatives. In addition, in connection with our August 1, 2008 acquisition ofRadyne, we are expanding our export internal control assessment to include ournewly acquired subsidiaries. To date, we have noted opportunities for improvingour procedures to comply with such laws and regulations, including at our newlyacquired Radyne subsidiaries and are in the process of makingimprovements. 18 During fiscal 2008, we have takennumerous steps to significantly improve our export control processes, includingthe hiring of additional employees who are knowledgeable and experienced withITAR and the engagement of an outside export consultant to conduct additionaltraining. We are also in the process of implementing enhanced formalcompany-wide ITAR control procedures, including at our newly acquired Radynesubsidiaries. Because our assessments are continuing, we expect to remediate,improve and enhance our internal controls relating to exports throughout fiscal2009.Because the above matters are ongoing,we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of these matters. Violations of U.S.export control-related laws and regulations could result in civil or criminalfines and/or penalties and/or result in an injunction against us, all of whichcould, in the aggregate, materially impact our business, results of operationsand cash flows. Should we identify a material weakness relating to ourcompliance, the ongoing costs of remediation could be material. In addition,inventory related to the Brazil contract (including the inventory that has beendetained) had a net book value of $1.1 million as of July 31, 2008. If thisinventory is permanently seized or not returned to us timely, or we can notresell the inventory to other customers, we would be required to write-off thevalue of this inventory in a future accounting period.Ourdependence on international sales and international sales agents may adverselyaffect us. U.S. export laws may also restrict our ability to sell our productsabroad which reduces our ability to obtain sales from foreigncustomers. Sales foruse by international customers (including sales to U.S. domestic companies forinclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) representedapproximately 26.7%, 26.2% and 35.6% of our consolidated net sales for thefiscal years ended July 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately21.4% of our backlog at July 31, 2008 consisted of orders for use by foreigncustomers. We expect that international sales (including sales from Radyne) willcontinue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales. Thesesales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations inforeign currency exchange rates (which may make our products lessprice-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to publichealth epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations,and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of ourproducts and the generally greater difficulties of doing businessabroad. Weattempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seekingsubcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S.dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in ourfavor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing businessin foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilledreceivables relating to international sales are subject to increasedcollectibility risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisionsrelating to termination at the convenience of the government. In somecountries, we may rely upon one international sales agent. We attempt to reduceour reliance on sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales officesand by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent salesrepresentative in a territory. Certainof our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agenciesfor export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to beexported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severelylimit unlicensed technical discussions such as with any persons who are not U.S.citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need alicense, it may reduce our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciledforeign company who may not be subject to the same U.S. laws. We cannot be sureof our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products,and failure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability tosell our products outside the U.S.  19 Wehave significant operations in Florida and California, and other locations,which could be materially and adversely impacted, in the event of a naturaldisaster or other significant disruption. Our telecommunications transmissionsegment designs and manufactures our over-the-horizon microwave equipment andsystems out of two facilities located in Florida, where major hurricanes haveoccurred in the past. As of August 1, 2008, our RF microwave amplifiers segmentmanufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifier and klystronamplifiers in Santa Clara,California, close to major earthquake fault lines. Our operations in these and otherlocations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing centerlocated in Tempe, Arizona and our mobile data communication segment’s networkoperations center located in Germantown, Maryland), could be subject to naturaldisasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons,tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weatherconditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts,telecommunications failures, and other natural and manmade disasters ordisruptions.In the event of such a natural disasteror other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to ouroperations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers orcustomers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which couldmaterially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect ourbusiness, revenue and financial condition.Allof our businesses are subject to rapid technological change; we rely uponlicensed technology for some of our products and we must keep pace with changesto compete successfully. We areengaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, andchanging customer demands. The introduction of products and services embodyingnew technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render any ofour products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The technology used inour products and services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, inlarge part, on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineeringexpertise and the development, either through internal research and developmentor acquisitions, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may not havethe economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and wemay not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made byour competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology islicensed by us from a third-party. A significant technologicalbreakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.Reductionsin telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect ourrevenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, includingintangible assets. For thelast several years, the U.S. and global economies have been growing and ourrevenues and profits have increased as our customers have increased theirspending on telecommunications equipment and systems. However, during fiscal2008, adverse conditions in the U.S. consumer mortgage market have negativelyimpacted the global economy and nearly all businesses, including ours, arefacing uncertain economic environments. Some economists are now predicting arecession. Our businesses have been negatively affected in the past by uncertaineconomic environments both in the overall market, and more specifically in thetelecommunications sector. As a result of the current global economicconditions, our customers may reduce their budgets for spending ontelecommunications equipment and systems. As a consequence, our currentcustomers and other prospective customers may postpone, reduce or even foregothe purchase of our products and systems, which could adversely affect ourrevenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, includingintangible assets. Although we remain confident that the long-term demanddrivers for our businesses, including our satellite earth station products,remain strong, it is currently difficult to assess whether or not futurebookings will meet or exceed the levels experienced in fiscal2008. 20 Ourmobile data communications business is subject to unique risks. Ourmobile data communications business segment is reliant upon just a fewcontracts. In addition to the other risk factors described in this section, therisk factors applicable to our mobile data communications business include thefollowing: ·  Our      mobile data communications segment’s revenues and profits are primarily      derived from the Movement Tracking Systems (“MTS”) contract and the U.S.      Army’s Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below command and control      systems (also known as Blue Force Tracking (“BFT”)) contract. Both of      these contracts can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to      unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions by the U.S.      government. Because both of these contracts are indefinite      delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, the U.S. Army is not      obligated to purchase any equipment or services under the      contracts. ·  Our      MTS and BFT contracts are not subject to automatic renewal or extension      upon their scheduled expiration on July 12, 2010 and December 31, 2011,      respectively.  In addition, the U.S. Army may decide to award      future orders, at any time, to other parties. If another party is awarded      future orders or if one or both of our contracts are not renewed, extended      or if we fail to succeed in a recompete process, it would have a material      adverse impact on our business and results of  operations. ·  In      fiscal 2007, the BFT program’s prime contractor, Northrop Grumman      Corporation, awarded a contract to a competitor to develop a new prototype      network and related equipment to increase network capacity for the U.S.      Army’s BFT tracking system. Although we are currently working closely with      the U.S. Army to provide additional enhancements to our network      capabilities and communications performance and believe that we have and      are developing new products that provide compelling technological      advancement to our existing products and that are, importantly, backwards      compatible with the large number of existing BFT and MTS systems in active      deployment today, it is possible that the U.S. Army (including our MTS      customers) will ultimately cease or reduce its ordering levels of our      products and services.  If this occurs, it would have a material      adverse impact on our business and results of  operations. ·  We      currently anticipate that we will continue to maintain a substantial      inventory in order to provide products to our customers on a timely basis.      Certain components required in our production process have purchasing      lead-times of four months or longer, and the delivery timetables on our      contracts require us to provide products in shorter timeframes after we      receive an order. If forecasted orders are not received, we may be left      with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals that      would result in an adverse impact on our business, results of operations      and financial condition. ·  We      lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from a      limited number of third party satellite networks. Our ability to grow and      remain profitable depends on the ability of our satellite network      providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security      to our customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the      prices of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures,      our business, results of operation and financial condition could be      adversely affected. ·  Our      systems occasionally experience downtime. All satellite communications are      subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a      natural disaster may interrupt service. Interruptions in service could      have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and      financial condition. Should we be required to restore service on another      system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which      would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of      operations and financial condition. ·  To      date, commercial satellite-based mobile data applications have not been a      material part of our business. In addition, we do not have extensive      experience designing, manufacturing or selling microsatellites and related      components. Our future success in developing these markets will depend on,      among other things, our ability to access the best distribution channels,      the development or licensing of applications which create value for the      customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We may      have to increase our operating expenses to be successful in these      markets.  21 ·  There      are several existing and potential commercial and defense-related      competitors, such as Qualcomm, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation, that      participate in the mobile data communications market and who have much      greater financial resources than us. Existing competitors, including      terrestrial-based service providers, are also aggressively pricing their      products and services and may continue to do so in the future. Competitors      such as ViaSat, Inc. and Harris Corporation continue to offer new      value-added products and services, which we may be unable to match on a      timely or cost effective basis. Companies, such as Surrey Satellite      Technology, Ltd. and MicroSat Systems, Inc., compete against us in the      microsatellite and related components markets.  Increased      competition may adversely impact margins throughout the industry. We      anticipate that new competitors will also enter the mobile data      communications market in the future. This could adversely impact our      existing business, results of operations and financial condition and could      also impair our ability to penetrate the commercial market in a      significant way. Ourbacklog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and suchcancellation could result in decreased sales and increased provisions for excessand obsolete inventory. Wecurrently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer maymodify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog are subject tocancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event thatwe are unable to perform under the contract.  We cannot assure youthat our backlog will result in net sales. We recorda provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and futureusage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount ofbacklog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog iscanceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to beinaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required forexcess and obsolete inventory.  In the future, if we determine thatour inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in ourfinancial statements at the time of such determination.  Any suchcharges could be material to our results of operations and financialcondition. Ourdependence on component availability, government furnished equipment,subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers, including the coremanufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing centerlocated in Tempe, Arizona, may adversely affect us. Althoughwe obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limitednumber of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are availablefrom alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in thedelivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. In recentyears, we have increased the company-wide dependency on our high-volumetechnology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of ourtelecommunications transmission segment. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobiledata communications segment were $123.8 million, $78.3 million and $55.7million, respectively. Intersegment sales in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 by thetelecommunications transmission segment to the RF microwave amplifiers segmentwere $16.0 million, $6.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively. If a naturaldisaster or other business interruption occurred, we do not have immediateaccess to other manufacturing facilities, and as a result, our business wouldsuffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center isunable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have amaterial adverse impact on all three of our business segments, our results ofoperations and our financial condition. We intendto continue to increase our company-wide dependency on our high-volumetechnology manufacturing center. For example, the success of the Radyneacquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipatedefficiencies and cost savings, primarily through the result of closing Radyne’sPhoenix, Arizona, manufacturing facility and integrating that operation into ourTempe, Arizona facility. We also intend to continue to seek contracts with thirdparties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. No assurances canbe given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and costsavings. In thepast, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certaincomponents that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into oursatellite transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receivethese government furnished components in a timely manner, we could experiencedelays in fulfilling orders from our customers.  22 Contractcost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot bejustified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us toreduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and otherrisks. Asubstantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed pricecontracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological,manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases inthe cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contractcosts that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth canoccur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price wereincorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation processrequires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may includeunavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the workto be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, theeffect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from thecustomer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included inthe estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or moreprograms could have a material impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Adverseregulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products. Ourproducts are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must complywith various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well asinternational laws and regulations. Regulatory changes, including changes in theallocation and availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standardsand specifications that define the current satellite networking environment,could materially harm our business by (i) restricting development efforts by usand our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete,or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. Changes in, orour failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materiallyharm our business. In addition, the increasing demand for wirelesscommunications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt newstandards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reducednumber of available frequencies for other products and services and the timedelays inherent in the government approval process of new products and serviceshave caused and may continue to cause our customers to cancel, postpone orreschedule their installation of communications systems including theirsatellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwavecommunication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect onour sales of products to our customers. The EUhas adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical andelectronic equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste fromElectrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which directs EU member states toenact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producersof electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for thecollection, recycling, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal of certainproducts placed on the market after August 13, 2005, and from products inuse prior to that date that are being replaced. The EU has also adopted theRestriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical andElectronic Equipment (“RoHS”) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the use oflead, mercury, and certain other substances in electrical and electronicproducts placed on the market in the EU after July 1, 2006. Similarlaws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions, including inthe U.S., China and Japan. Other environmental regulations may require us toreengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentallycompatible, and such reengineering and component substitution may result inadditional costs to us. There can be no assurance that such existing or futurelaws will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Ourinvestments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result ofprior acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets resultingfrom our Radyne acquisition could be impaired as a result of future businessconditions, requiring us to record substantial write-downs that would reduce ouroperating income. We havegoodwill and intangible assets of $31.9 million recorded on our balance sheet asof July 31, 2008. This amount will materially increase as a result of the Radyneacquisition. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts andintangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. Theannual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Changesin our operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result inan impairment of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations.In addition, if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operatingefficiencies associated with the Radyne acquisition, our goodwill and intangibleassets may become impaired.  23 Theloss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect ourbusiness. Oursuccess depends on the continued contributions of key technical managementpersonnel, including the key corporate and operating unit management at each ofour subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel, particularly the key engineers ofour subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subject toemployment or noncompetition agreements. Our growth and future success willdepend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualifiedengineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel fromother companies, academic institutions, government entities and otherorganizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful todate in recruiting and keeping key personnel, we may not be successful inattracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow andoperate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate forus in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow anddiversify. Ourbusiness and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable tocontinue to manage growth of our businesses. Certainof our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, andmay continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational andfinancial resources. In addition to anticipated organic growth, our revenues areexpected to significantly increase in fiscal 2009 as a result of the Radyneacquisition. In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve andexpand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We alsoneed to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage ouremployee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilitiesand production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new productintroductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able totimely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standardsrequired by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a materialadverse impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.Ourmarkets are highly competitive. Themarkets for our products are highly competitive. We cannot assure you that wewill be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not developnew technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expectthe DoD’s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components inmilitary equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also,although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in itsearly stages in many developing countries, we believe competition may intensifyas businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential oftelecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical,marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours. Protectionof our intellectual property is limited; we are subject to the risk of thirdparty claims of infringement. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology islicensed by us from a third-party. Our businesses rely in large part uponour proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques.Historically, patents have not been an important part of our protection of ourintellectual property rights. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition,restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protectour intellectual property. We limit access to and distribution of ourproprietary information. These efforts allow us to rely upon the knowledge andexperience of our management and technical personnel to market our existingproducts and to develop new products. The departure of any of our key managementand technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosureobligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectivesmay have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve futurerevenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietarytechnology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may failto do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products areor may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights tothe same extent as the laws of the U.S.Webelieve that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessaryfor the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated. If the technologywe use is found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required tochange our business practices, license the protected technology, and/or paydamages or other compensation to the infringed party. If we are unable tolicense protected technology that we use in our business or if we are requiredto change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making and sellingour products or providing certain telecommunications services.  24 Ouroperations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and we may besubject to environmental liabilities. We engagein manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federalgovernmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission,generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances usedto manufacture our products, such as the fabrication of fiberglass antennas byour Comtech Antenna Systems, Inc. subsidiary. We are also subject to the RoHSdirective which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances inelectrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or futureenvironmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines,suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessationof operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. Inaddition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us orour predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, incontamination requiring investigation or remediation, or leading to otherliabilities, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business,results of operations and financial condition. Ourfiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 Federal income tax returns were recently audited bythe Internal Revenue Service and our fiscal 2006 tax return has been selectedfor audit. Other returns may be selected for audit in the future. Althoughadjustments relating to our fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 tax return wereimmaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for fiscal 2006 and otherperiods that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverseimpact on our results of operations and financial position. We aresubject to income taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions,including Canada. Significant judgment is required in determining the provisionfor income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, thefinal determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could bematerially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisionsand accruals. Recentlyenacted securities laws and regulations are increasing our costs and possiblefuture changes to financial reporting standards may result in incrementalcosts. TheSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance,public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes resulted in increasedcosts and as we grow, we expect to see our costs increase. The SEC haspromulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including thepossibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial ReportingStandards (“IFRS”). If we are required to change our financial reportingstandards and policies to comply with IFRS, our costs could significantlyincrease. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) has revised itsrequirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on the NASDAQ. Thesechanges are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including makingit more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officerliability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe thatthese new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for usto attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularlyto serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers. Weare subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Identification of material weaknesses in internalcontrols (including those at our newly acquired subsidiaries at Radyne), ifidentified, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accuratefinancial statements. Pursuantto Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we arerequired to furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness ofour internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independentregistered accountants are required to attest to and report on management’sassessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, wedocument our internal control design and the testing processes that support ourevaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There canbe no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses,if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of thecontrols necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurancethat we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accountingpersonnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel amongpublicly traded companies.  25 Changesin financial accounting standards related to stock-based awards are expected tocontinue to have a significant effect on our reported results. In fiscal2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),“Share-Based Payment,” a revised standard that requires that we recordcompensation expense in the statement of operations for employee and directorstock-based awards using a fair valuemethod. The adoption of the new standard had a significant effect on ourreported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurateguidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of thefactors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards. As a result, theongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our commonstock and may result in greater stock price volatility. Inaddition, since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamentalcomponent of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-basedawards directlymotivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through theuse of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the extentthat this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-basedawards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change ourequity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain andmotivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Weface risks from the uncertainty of prevailing political conditions. Currentglobal political conditions are uncertain. For example, the winner of theNovember 2008 U.S. presidential election could significantly change policies orpriorities which could have a negative impact on our business. Because theaccuracy of our budgeting and forecasting process relies on stable politicalconditions, the prevailing political environment renders estimates of futureincome and expenses even more difficult than usual to formulate. The futuredirection of the political environment could have a material adverse impact onour business, results of operations and financial condition. Terroristattacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of warelsewhere may negatively impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costsand stock price.Terroristattacks, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ responses thereto, andthreats of war could adversely impact our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future eventsmay disrupt our operations or those of our customers and may affect theavailability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means totransport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products tocustomers. In addition, these could have an adverse impact on the U.S. and worldeconomy in general. Provisionsin our corporate documents, stockholder rights plan, and Delaware law coulddelay or prevent a change in control of Comtech. We havetaken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delayingor preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholdersmay consider favorable. For example, we have a classified board and theemployment contract with our chief executive officer and contracts with other ofour executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstancesor in the event of a change of control of Comtech. We also adopted a stockholderrights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, andsubstantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquireus on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions couldprevent us from being acquired. In addition, our certificate of incorporationgrants our Board of Directors the authority to fix the rights, preferences andprivileges of and issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock withoutstockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue shares ofpreferred stock, such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stockcould have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the commonstock or which could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of Comtech. Inaddition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DelawareGeneral Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute providesthat except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage inany “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period ofthree years after the date of the transaction in which the person became aninterested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in aprescribed manner. A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales andother transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interestedstockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law, an “interested stockholder” is a person who,together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more ofthe corporation’s voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delayingor preventing a change in control of Comtech.  26 Ourdebt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. Thehigher level of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of our 2.0% convertiblesenior notes increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our2.0% convertible senior notes, may, at our option, be redeemable for cash on orafter February 4, 2009. Holders of our 2.0% convertible senior notes have theright to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding 2.0%convertible senior notes on February 1, 2011, February 1, 2014 and February 1,2019, and upon certain events, including a change in control. Should wedecide to redeem some or all of the outstanding 2.0% convertible senior notes,or if the holders of our 2.0% convertible senior notes require us to repurchasesome or all of the outstanding 2.0% convertible senior notes, we cannot assureyou that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest onour debt or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will beavailable to pay or refinance such debt. The level of our indebtedness, amongother things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt; makeit difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for workingcapital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or otherpurposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in ourbusiness and the industry in which we compete; and make us more vulnerable inthe event of a downturn in our business. Ourstock price is volatile.The stockmarket in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies inparticular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated tothe operating performance of any specific public company.  The marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likelyto fluctuate significantly in the future as well.Factorsthat could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock aredescribed throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include:·  strategic      transactions, such as acquisitions and  divestures;·  issuance      of potentially dilutive equity-type securities·  future      announcements concerning us or ourcompetitors;·  receipt      or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and      services;·  quality      deficiencies in services orproducts;·  results      of technological innovations;·  new      commercial products;·  changes      in recommendations of securitiesanalysts;·  government      regulations;·  proprietary      rights or product or patentlitigation;·  changes      in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications      sector;·  changes      in securities market conditions,generally;·  energy      blackouts;·  acts      of terrorism or war;·  inflation      or deflation; and·  rumors      or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or      practices.Shortfallsin our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected bysecurities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect thetrading price of our common stock.  "
1,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2007-09-19,"ITEM 1A. RISK            FACTORSForward-Looking            StatementsThis Form 10-K            contains “forward-looking statements” including statements concerning the            future of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of            our products, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements            can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,”            “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,”            “continue,” or other similar words. When considering forward-looking            statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in            this Form 10-K. However, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks            that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do            not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business,            financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted            below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our actual            financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any            forward-looking statement.Due to many            factors, including the amount of business represented by large contracts, new orders,            net sales and our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be            volatile.We have            experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders,            net sales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, from            quarter-to-quarter. One reason for this is that a significant portion of our business            — primarily the over-the-horizon microwave systems of our telecommunications            transmission segment, our RF microwave amplifiers segment and our mobile data            communications segment — is derived from a limited number of relatively large            customer contracts, the timing of which cannot be predicted. Our new orders, net sales            and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, also may vary            significantly from period-to-period because of the following factors: product mix sold;            fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our            competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in            delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatory developments;            changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our            stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation            expense we may record); and general economic conditions. Accordingly, you should not            rely on period-to-period comparisons as indications of our future performance because            these comparisons may not be meaningful.Our business,            results of operations, liquidity and financial position depend on our ability to            maintain our level of U.S. government business.In recent years,            we have increased our dependence on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S.            government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for            approximately 61.3%, 47.3% and 42.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years            ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 47.9% of our backlog at            July 31, 2007 consisted of orders from the U.S. government. We expect such business to            represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable            future. U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including:    •unexpected contract or                        project terminations or suspensions;    •unpredictable order                        placements, reductions or cancellations;    •reductions in                        government funds available for our projects due to government policy                        changes, budget cuts and other spending priorities;    •penalties arising from                        post-award contract audits;    •cost                        audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced;    •higher-than-expected                        final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development,                        for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries                        for a fixed price; and    •unpredictable cash                        collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of                        contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures,                        including government approval of final indirect rates.12All of our U.S.            government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience.            Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred            or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In            addition to the right of the U.S. government to terminate, U.S. government contracts            are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending.            Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even            though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning            of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are            normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by            Congress for future fiscal years.We obtain U.S.            government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We cannot assure you that            we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will            generate sufficient net sales to result in profitability.If we are            unable to comply with complex U.S. government regulations governing security and            contracting practices, we could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S            government.As a supplier to            the U.S. government we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing            security and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement            regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our            suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new            government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we            would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales            of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for            disqualification are violations of various statutes, including those related to            procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment            practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records in the recording of            costs, and foreign corruption. The government could investigate and make inquiries of            our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting.            Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our            contract-related costs and fees. Depending on the results of these audits and            investigations, the government could make claims against us, and if it were to prevail,            certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us.Our            dependence on international sales and international sales agents may adversely affect            us.Sales for use by            international customers (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in            products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 26.2%,            35.6% and 44.0% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2007,            2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 42.9% of our backlog at July 31, 2007            consisted of orders for use by foreign customers. Direct and indirect sales to a North            African country during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,            respectively, were 3.0%, 9.7% and 13.2% of consolidated net sales. We expect that            international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net            sales.These sales            expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign            currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political            and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable            export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may            apply to the export of our products and the generally greater difficulties of doing            business abroad.We attempt to            reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with            large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone            payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to            reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries, in all instances. In            such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject            to increased collectibility risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could            have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.In some            countries, such as the aforementioned North African country, we rely upon one            international sales agent. We attempt to reduce our reliance on sales agents by            establishing additional foreign sales offices and by engaging, where practicable, more            than one independent sales representative in a territory.Foreign defense            contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of            the government. In addition, certain of our products and systems may require licenses            from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are            not permitted to be exported. We cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses            that may be required to export our products, and failure to receive required licenses            could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outside the U.S.13All of our            businesses are subject to rapid technological change; we must keep pace with changes to            compete successfully.We are engaged            in businesses characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards,            frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The            introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of            new industry standards could render any of our products and services obsolete or            non-competitive. The technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly, and            our business position depends, in large part, on the continuous refinement of our            scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internal            research and development or acquisitions, of new or enhanced products and technologies.            We may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such            efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements            made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. A significant            technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or new firms, could            have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.Reductions in            telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues,            profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible            assets.For the last            several years, the U.S. and global economies have been growing and our revenues and            profits have increased as our customers have increased their spending on            telecommunications equipment and systems. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal            2007, adverse conditions in the U.S. consumer mortgage market appear to have spread to            the commercial loan market and nearly all businesses, including ours, are facing            uncertain economic environments. Some economists are now predicting a            recession.Our businesses            have been negatively affected in the past by uncertain economic environments both in            the overall market, and more specifically in the telecommunications sector. If the            economy slows, some of our customers may reduce their budgets for spending on            telecommunications equipment and systems. As a consequence, our current customers and            other prospective customers may postpone, reduce or even forego the purchase of our            products and systems, which could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and the            recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets.In the third            quarter of fiscal 2007, bookings of our satellite earth station products were below our            expectations. We believe this was most likely due to inherent order flow fluctuations            that exist in any communications technology book and ship business; and in fact, during            the fourth quarter of 2007, bookings regained their strength and met our expectations.            Although we remain confident that the long-term demand drivers for our businesses,            including our satellite earth station products, remain strong, it is currently            difficult to assess whether or not future bookings will meet or exceed the levels            experienced in fiscal 2007.Our mobile            data communications business is subject to unique risks.Although sales            and earnings have increased significantly in the past few years, our mobile data            communications business has a relatively limited operating history compared to our            other business segments. Our mobile data communications business segment is reliant            upon just a few contracts and it is subject to many of the risks inherent in the            operation of a new business enterprise. In addition to the other risk factors described            in this section, the risk factors applicable to our mobile data communications business            include the following:          • Our          mobile data communications segment’s revenues and profits are          primarily derived from the Movement Tracking Systems (“MTS”)          contract and the U.S. Army’s Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade          and Below command and control systems (also known as Blue Force Tracking          (“BFT”)) contract. Both of these contracts can be terminated          at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding, deployment          and technology decisions by the U.S. government. Because both these          contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”)          contracts, the U.S. Army is not obligated to purchase any equipment          or services under the contracts.          • Our          MTS and BFT contracts are not subject to automatic renewal or extension          upon their scheduled expiration on July 12, 2010 and December 31, 2011,          respectively. In addition, the U.S. Army may decide to award future          orders, at any time, to other parties. If another party is awarded future          orders or if one or both of our contracts are not renewed, extended          or if we fail to succeed in a recompete process, it would have a material          adverse impact on our business and results of operations.      14    •The                        BFT program’s prime contractor, Northrop Grumman Corporation, has                        awarded a contract to a competitor to develop a new prototype network and                        related equipment to increase network capacity for                        the U.S. Army’s BFT tracking system. Although we are currently                        working closely with the U.S. Army to provide additional enhancements to                        our network capabilities and communications performance and believe that we                        have and are developing new products that provide compelling technological                        advancement to our existing products and that is, importantly, backwards                        compatible with the large number of existing BFT and MTS systems in active                        deployment today, it is possible that the U.S. Army (including our MTS                        customers) will ultimately cease or reduce its ordering levels of our                        products and services. If this occurs, it would have a material adverse                        impact on our business and results of operations.    •We                        currently anticipate that we will continue to maintain a substantial                        inventory in order to provide products to our customers on a timely basis.                        Certain components required in our production process have purchasing                        lead-times of four months or longer, and the delivery timetables on our                        contracts require us to provide products in shorter timeframes after we                        receive an order. If forecasted orders are not received, we may be left                        with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals that                        would result in an adverse impact on our business, results of operations                        and financial position.    •We                        lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from a limited                        number of third party satellite networks. Our ability to grow and remain                        profitable depends on the ability of our satellite network providers to                        provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our                        customers. If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices                        of their services, or to suffer operational or technical failures, our                        business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely                        affected.    •Our                        systems occasionally experience downtime. All satellite communications are                        subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural                        disaster may interrupt service. Interruptions in service could have a                        material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and                        financial condition. Should we be required to restore service on another                        system in the event of a satellite failure, our costs could increase which                        would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations                        and financial condition.    •To                        date, commercial satellite-based mobile data applications have not been a                        material part of our business. Our future success in commercial markets                        will depend on, among other things, our ability to access the best                        distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which                        create value for the customer and our ability to attract and retain                        qualified personnel. We may have to increase our operating expenses to be                        successful in the commercial satellite-based mobile data market.    •There are several                        existing and potential commercial and defense-related competitors, such as                        Qualcomm, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation, that participate in the                        mobile data communications market and who have much greater financial                        resources than us. Existing competitors, including terrestrial-based                        service providers, are also aggressively pricing their products and                        services and may continue to do so in the future. Competitors such as                        ViaSat, Inc. and Harris Corporation continue to offer new value-added                        products and services, which we may be unable to match on a timely or cost                        effective basis. Increased competition may adversely impact margins                        throughout the industry. We anticipate that new competitors will also enter                        the mobile data communications market in the future. This could adversely                        impact our existing business, results of operations and financial condition                        and could also impair our ability to penetrate the commercial market in a                        significant way.Our backlog            is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result            in decreased sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete            inventory.We currently            have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or            terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog are subject to cancellation at            the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to            perform under the contract. We cannot assure you that our backlog will result in net            sales.We record a            provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends            and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand            at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates            of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have            understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if            we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such            costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges            could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.15Our            dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractor            availability and performance and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing            expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona,            may adversely affect us.None of our            business segments generally maintain a substantial inventory of components and            subsystems. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source            or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are            available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in            the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse impact on our            business, results of operations and financial condition.In recent years,            we have increased the company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology            manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications            transmission segment. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, intersegment sales by the            telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were            $78.3 million, $55.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively. Intersegment sales in            fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 by the telecommunications transmission segment to the RF            microwave amplifiers segment were $6.5 million, $7.5 million and $8.6 million,            respectively. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred, we do not            have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities, and as a result, our business            would suffer. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center is unable            to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse            impact on all three of our business segments, our results of operations and our            financial condition.Throughout            fiscal 2007, the U.S. government experienced delays in the receipt of certain            components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite            transceivers that we ship to the U.S. government. If we do not receive these government            furnished components in a timely manner, we could experience delays in fulfilling            orders from our customers.Contract cost            growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an            increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and            the potential loss of future business and other risks.Almost all of            our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bear            the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price            increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely            affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This            cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were            incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. The cost estimation process requires            significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability            and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the            effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in            performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters,            and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A            significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact            on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse            regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products.Our products are            incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S.            government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as international laws and            regulations. Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocation and availability            of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that define the            current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by (i)            restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current            products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for            additional competition.Changes in, or            our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our            business. In addition, the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted            pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth            for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other            products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process            of new products and services have caused and may continue to cause our customers to            cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including            their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave            communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales            of products to our customers.The EU has            adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic            equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste from Electrical and            Electronic Equipment directive, which directs EU member states to enact laws,            regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and            electronic  equipment are  financially  responsible  for             the  collection, recycling,  treatment,  and             environmentally sound disposal of16certain products placed on the market after August 13, 2005, and from            products in use prior to that date that are being replaced. The EU has also adopted the            Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic            Equipment (“RoHS”) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the use of lead,            mercury, and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on            the market in the EU after July 1, 2006.Similar laws and            regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions, including in the U.S., China            and Japan. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to            utilize components that are more environmentally compatible, and such reengineering and            component substitution may result in additional costs to us. There can be no assurance            that such existing or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our            business.Acquisitions            and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention; results            may fall short of expectations.We intend to            continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses, technologies            and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy. Any future acquisition or            investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive            issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt and amortization expenses or in            process research and development charges related to intangible assets. Acquisitions            involve numerous risks, including:    •difficulties in the                        integration and assimilation of the operations, technologies, products and                        personnel of an acquired business;    •diversion of                        management’s attention from other business concerns;    •increased expenses                        associated with the acquisition; and    •loss                        of key employees or customers of any acquired business.We cannot assure            you that our acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our            business, results of operations or financial condition.We have            investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in            future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring            substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.Goodwill            recorded on our balance sheet as of July 31, 2007 was $24.4 million. We evaluate the            recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential            impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring            judgment. Changes in our operating performance or business conditions, in general,            could result in an impairment of goodwill which could be material to our results of            operations.The loss of            key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our            business.Our success            depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, including            the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of            our key personnel, particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries, would be            difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements.            Our growth and future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and            retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for            such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and            other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to            date in recruiting and keeping key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting            and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably.            Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not            continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify.Our business            and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to continue to manage            growth of our businesses.Certain of our            businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continue            to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources.            In order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management,            operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and            retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage            research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet            product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we            are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality            standards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a            material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.17Our markets            are highly competitive.The markets for            our products are highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to            successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and            products that are more effective than our own. We expect the DoD’s increased use            of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will            encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of            advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing            countries, we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governments            realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors            have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than            ours.Protection of            our intellectual property is limited; we are subject to the risk of third party claims            of infringement.Our businesses            rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering            “know-how” and production techniques. Historically, patents have not been            an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely upon            the laws of unfair competition, restrictions in licensing agreements and            confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We limit access to and            distribution of our proprietary information. These efforts allow us to rely upon the            knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our            existing products and to develop new products. The departure of any of our key            management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and            non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property            objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations            and financial condition.Our ability to            compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our            ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the            rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in            which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual            property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.We believe that            we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of            our businesses as currently contemplated. If the technology we use is found to infringe            on protected technology, we could be required to change our business practices, license            the protected technology, and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed            party. If we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or            if we are required to change our business practices, we could be prohibited from making            and selling our products or providing certain telecommunications services.Our            operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to            environmental liabilities.We engage in            manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental            regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation,            manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our            products, such as the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our Comtech Antenna            Systems, Inc. subsidiary. We are also subject to the RoHS directive which restricts the            use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The            failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the            imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our            manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse            impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the            handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may            have resulted or could in the future result in contamination requiring investigation or            remediation, or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material            adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.Our fiscal            2004 Federal income tax return is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, other            returns may be selected for audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could            have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial            position.We are subject            to income taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Canada.            Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.            Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax            examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is            reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.18In fiscal 2006,            we were informed by the Internal Revenue Service that our Federal income tax return for            the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 was selected for a general tax audit. The audit is            ongoing and additional income tax returns for other fiscal years may be examined. If            the outcome of the audit differs materially from our original income tax provisions, it            could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial            condition.Recently            enacted securities laws and regulations are increasing our costs.The            Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public            disclosure and compliance practices. For example, the SEC has promulgated new rules on            a variety of subjects. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”)            has revised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on the NASDAQ.            These changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making            it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability            insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new laws            and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified            members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and            qualified executive officers.We are            subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley            Act of 2002. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls, if identified,            could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial            statements.Pursuant to            Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to            furnish a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal            controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered            accountants are required to attest to and report on management’s assessment, as            well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal            control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion,            and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we            will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future            periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There            likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance            and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such            personnel among publicly traded companies.Changes in            financial accounting standards related to stock-based awards are expected to continue            to have a significant effect on our reported results.In fiscal 2006,            we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based            Payment,” a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in            the statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair            value method. The adoption of the new standard had a significant effect on our reported            earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our            future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to            estimate the value of stock-based awards. As a result, the ongoing application of this            standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater            stock price volatility.In addition,            since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our            employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate            our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term            vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the extent that this accounting            standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may            incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it            difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a            material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.We face risks            from the uncertainty of prevailing political conditions.Current global            political conditions are uncertain. Because the accuracy of our budgeting and            forecasting process relies on stable political conditions, the prevailing political            environment renders estimates of future income and expenses even more difficult than            usual to formulate. The future direction of the political environment could have a            material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial            condition.Terrorist            attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war elsewhere may            negatively impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock            price.Terrorist            attacks, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ responses thereto,            and threats of war could adversely impact our business, results of operations and            financial condition. Any escalation in these events or similar or future events may            disrupt our operations or those  of  our customers and may affect the             availability of19materials needed            to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing            facilities and finished products to customers. In addition, these could have an adverse            impact on the U.S. and world economy in general.Provisions in            our corporate documents, stockholder rights plan, and Delaware law could delay or            prevent a change in control of Comtech.We have taken a            number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a            merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.            For example, we have a classified board and the employment contract of our chief            executive officer provides for a substantial payment in the event of a change of            control of Comtech. We also adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause            substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a            stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of            Directors. These provisions could prevent us from being acquired. In addition, our            certificate of incorporation grants our Board of Directors the authority to fix the            rights, preferences and privileges of and issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred            stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue shares            of preferred stock, such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stock            could have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or            which could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of Comtech. In addition, we            are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,            an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that except in certain limited            circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any “business combination”            with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date            of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the            business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business            combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a            financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for            purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an “interested            stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three            years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. This provision            could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of            Comtech.Our debt            service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.The higher level            of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of our 2.0% convertible senior notes            increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We cannot assure you            that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt            or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay            or refinance such debt.   The level of our                        indebtedness, among other things, could:    •make                        it difficult for us to make payments on our debt;    •make                        it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for                        working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service                        requirements or other purposes;    •limit our flexibility                        in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry                        in which we compete; and    •make                        us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.Our stock            price is volatile.The stock market            in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, have            experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating            performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has            fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the            future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our            stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include:    •strategic transactions,                        such as acquisitions and divestures;  •future announcements                        concerning us or our competitors; •receipt or non-receipt                        of substantial orders for products and services; •quality deficiencies in                        services or products;  •results of                        technological innovations;  •new                        commercial products;  •changes in                        recommendations of securities analysts; •government                        regulations;20    •proprietary rights or                        product or patent litigation; •changes in economic                        conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications                        sector; •changes in securities                        market conditions, generally; •energy                        blackouts;  •acts                        of terrorism or war; •inflation or deflation;                        and  •rumors or allegations                        regarding our financial disclosures or practices.Shortfalls in            our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities            analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our            common stock"
7,CMTL,COMTECH TELECOMMUN,2006-09-20,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSForward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including statements concerning thefuture of our industry, product development, business strategy, continued acceptance of our products,market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by theuse of forward-looking terminology such as may, expect, anticipate,estimate, continue, or other similar words. When considering forward-lookingstatements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form10-K. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could causeour actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-lookingstatement.10Due to many factors, including the amount of business represented by large contracts, new orders, netsales and our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be volatile.We have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, netsales and operating results, including our net income and earnings per share, from quarter-to-quarter.One reason for this is that a significant portion of our business  primarily the over-the-horizonmicrowave systems of our telecommunications transmission segment, our RF microwave amplifiers segmentand our mobile data communications segment  is derived from a limited number of relativelylarge customer contracts, the timing of which cannot be predicted. Our new orders, net sales andoperating results, including our net income and earnings per share, also may vary significantly fromperiod-to-period because of the following factors: product mix sold; fluctuating market demand; pricecompetition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates; unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems; political instability; regulatorydevelopments; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items,the amount of stock based compensation expense we may record); and general economic conditions. Accordingly,you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons as indications of our future performance becausethese comparisons may not be meaningful. Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position depend on our ability to maintainour level of U.S. government business.In recent years, we have increased our dependence on U.S. government business. Our sales to the U.S.government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) accounted for approximately47.3%, 42.1% and 40.1% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2006, 2005and 2004, respectively. Approximately 60.4% of our backlog at July 31, 2006 consisted of orders fromthe U.S. government. We expect such business to represent a significant portion of our consolidatednet sales for the foreseeable future. U.S. government business exposes us to various risks, including: unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;  unpredictable order placements, reductions or cancellations;  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes, budget  cuts and other spending priorities; penalties arising from post-award contract audits; cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced; higher-than-expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work  performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; and unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract  deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government approval of  final indirect rates. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience.Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed,settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the right ofthe U.S. government to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approvalby Congress of the necessary spending. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program ona fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, atthe beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies arenormally committed to the contract only if, as and when appropriations are made by Congress for futurefiscal years. We obtain U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We cannot assure you thatwe will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sufficientnet sales to result in profitability.11If we are unable to comply with complex U.S. government regulations governing security and contracting  practices, we could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S government.As a supplier to the U.S. government we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governingsecurity and contracting practices. Failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practicescould result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibilityfor bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier togovernment agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenuesfrom sales of our products would decline significantly. Among the potential causes for disqualificationare violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control,U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracyof records in the recording of costs, and foreign corruption. The government could investigate andmake inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting.Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government could adjust our contract-related costsand fees. Depending on the results of these audits and investigations, the government could makeclaims against us, and if it were to prevail, certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us. Our dependence on international sales and international sales agents may adversely affect us.Sales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusionin products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 35.6%, 44.0%and 45.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,respectively. Approximately 28.4% of our backlog at July 31, 2006 consisted of orders for use byforeign customers. Direct and indirect sales to a North African country during the fiscal year endedJuly 31, 2006 were 9.7% of consolidated net sales. We expect that international sales will continueto be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales.These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability,exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations,and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products and the generallygreater difficulties of doing business abroad. We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with largesystems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocableletters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doingbusiness in foreign countries, in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relatingto international sales are subject to increased collectibility risk and may result in significantwrite-offs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.In some countries, such as the aforementioned North African country, we rely upon one internationalsales agent. We attempt to reduce our reliance on sales agents by establishing additional foreignsales offices and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representativein a territory. Foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience ofthe government. In addition, certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. governmentagencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. Wecannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products, andfailure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outsidethe U.S.All of our businesses are subject to rapid technological change; we must keep pace with changes tocompete successfully.We are engaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards,frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introductionof products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards couldrender any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The technology used in our productsand services evolves rapidly, and our business position depends, in large part, on the continuousrefinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development, either through internalresearch and development or acquisitions, of new or enhanced products and technologies. We may nothave the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be ableto identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effectivefashion. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including smaller competitors or newfirms, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.12Reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues,profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets.From the second half of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, our revenues from commercial customers werenegatively affected by the uncertain economic environment both in the overall market, and more specificallyin the telecommunications sector. Since 2003, the telecommunications sector has stabilized and isgrowing again; however, if the economy slows, some of our customers may reduce their budgets forspending on telecommunications equipment and systems. As a consequence, our current customers andother prospective customers may postpone, reduce or even forego the purchase of our products andsystems, which could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and the recoverability of our assets,including intangible assets.Our mobile data communications business is subject to unique risks.Although sales and earnings have increased significantly in the past few years, our mobile data communicationsbusiness has a relatively limited operating history compared to our other business segments. It issubject to many of the risks inherent in the operation of a new business enterprise. In additionto the other risk factors described in this section, the risk factors applicable to our mobile datacommunications business include the following: Our contract for the U.S. Army logistics communitys MTS system currently obligates us to provide  hardware, including mobile satellite transceivers, and satellite and other services, through July  2007, at fixed prices and other terms set forth in the contract. The U.S. Army is not obligated to  purchase any equipment or services under the contract. Orders and related sales relating to this  contract are subject to unpredictable funding and deployment decisions. The MTS contract is not subject to automatic renewal or extension upon its scheduled expiration in  July 2007. As such, the U.S. Army may decide to recompete the contract in which case a new MTS contract  for all or a portion of our efforts could be awarded to another party in the future. If the MTS contract  is not renewed, extended or if we fail to succeed in a recompete process, it would have a material  adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  In general, as we seek to grow our mobile data communications business, we anticipate that we will  need to maintain a substantial inventory in order to provide terminals to our customers on a timely  basis. Certain components that we need have purchasing lead-times of four months or longer, and the  MTS contract requires us to provide mobile terminals within 90 days after we receive an order. If  forecasted orders are not received, we may be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable  parts or terminals that would result in an adverse impact on our business, results of operations  and financial position. We lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from a limited number of third party  satellite networks. Our ability to grow and remain profitable depends on the ability of our satellite  network providers to provide sufficient network capacity, reliability and security to our customers.  If our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services, or to suffer operational  or technical failures, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely  affected. Our systems occasionally experience downtime. All satellite communications are subject to the risk  that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service. Interruptions  in service could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial  condition. Should we be required to restore service on another system in the event of a satellite  failure, our costs could increase which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of  operations and financial condition. To date, commercial satellite-based mobile data applications have not been a material part of our business.  Our future success in commercial markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to access  the best distribution channels, the development or licensing of applications which create value for  the customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We may have to increase our  operating expenses to be successful in the commercial satellite-based mobile data market.  There are several existing commercial and defense-related competitors, such as Qualcomm, Inc. and Northrop  Grumman Corporation, that participate in the mobile data communications market and who have much  greater financial resources than us. Existing competitors, including terrestrial-based service providers,  are also aggressively pricing their products and services and may continue to do so in the future.  Competitors continue to offer new value added products and services, which we may be unable to match  on a timely or cost effective basis. Increased competition may impact margins throughout the industry.  We anticipate that new competitors will also enter the mobile data communications market in the future.  This 13  could impact our penetration into the commercial market in a significant way and could negatively impact  our existing business, results of operation and financial condition.  Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could resultin decreased sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.We currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate.Almost all of the contracts in our backlog are subject to cancellation at the convenience of thecustomer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. We cannotassure you that our backlog will result in net sales.We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trendsincluding the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time.If our backlog is cancelled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate,in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Inthe future, if we determine that our inventory was overvalued, we would be required to recognizesuch costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges couldbe material to our results of operations and financial position.Our dependence on component availability, subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers,including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center locatedin Tempe, Arizona, may adversely affect us.None of our business segments generally maintain a substantial inventory of components and subsystems.Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number ofsources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliersand subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could havea material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In recent years, we have increased the company-wide dependency on our high-volume technology manufacturingcenter located in Tempe, Arizona, which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment. Infiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment tothe mobile data communications segment were $55.7 million, $19.5 million, and $12.8 million, respectively.Intersegment sales in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 by the telecommunications transmission segment tothe RF microwave amplifiers segment were $7.5 million, $8.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively.If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred, we do not have immediate access toother manufacturing facilities, and as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, if our high-volumetechnology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it couldhave a material adverse impact on all three of our business segments, our results of operations andour financial condition. Contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as anincrease in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potentialloss of future business and other risks.Almost all of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts. This means that we bearthe risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increasesor other increases in the cost of performance. Operating margin is adversely affected when contractcosts that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimatesused for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. Thecost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth mayinclude unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance,availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recoverany claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or moreprograms could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products.Our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S.government regulations, including those of the FCC,as well as international laws and regulations. Regulatory changes, including changes in the allocationand availability of frequency spectrum, and in the military standards and specifications that definethe current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by (i) restrictingdevelopment efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive orobsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition.14Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially harm ourbusiness. In addition, the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure onregulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products andservices. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the timedelays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused and maycontinue to cause our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communicationssystems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwavecommunication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of productsto our customers.The EU has recently adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronicequipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipmentdirective, which directs EU member states to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisionsto ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for thecollection, recycling, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal of certain products placed onthe market after August 13, 2005, and from products in use prior to that date that are beingreplaced. The EU has also adopted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electricaland Electronic Equipment (RoHS) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the use of lead,mercury, and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the marketin the EU after July 1, 2006. Similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions, including in the U.S., Chinaand Japan. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize componentsthat are more environmentally compatible, and such reengineering and component substitution may resultin additional costs to us. There can be no assurance that such existing or future laws will not havea material adverse effect on our business. Acquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention; results mayfall short of expectations.We intend to continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses, technologiesand product lines as a key component of our growth strategy. Any future acquisition or investmentmay result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities,incurrence of debt and amortization expenses or in process research and development charges relatedto intangible assets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations, technologies, products and personnelof an acquired business; diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; increased expenses associated with the acquisition; and potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business. We cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business,results of operations or financial condition.We have investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and changes in future businessconditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs thatwould reduce our operating income.Goodwill recorded on our balance sheet as of July 31, 2006 was $22.2 million. We evaluate the recoverabilityof recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annualimpairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Changes in our operating performanceor business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill which could be materialto our results of operations.The loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business.Our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel, includingthe key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries. Many of our key personnel,particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries, would be difficult to replace, and are not subjectto employment or noncompetition agreements. Our growth and future success will depend in large partupon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel.Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities andother organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruitingand keeping key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and 15retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably. Also, the managementskills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continueto grow and diversify.Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to continue to managegrowth of our businesses.Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may continueto place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order tomanage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financialsystems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manageour employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and productionand inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technologytransitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the qualitystandards required by our existing and potential customers, we could experience a material adverseimpact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our markets are highly competitive.The markets for our products are highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfullycompete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effectivethan our own. We expect the DoDs increased use of commercial off-the-shelfproducts and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market.Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stagesin many developing countries, we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governmentsrealize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial,technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.Protection of our intellectual property is limited; we are subject to the risk of third party claimsof infringement.Our businesses rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-howand production techniques. Historically, patents have not been an important part of our protectionof our intellectual property rights. We rely upon the laws of unfair competition, restrictions inlicensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We limitaccess to and distribution of our proprietary information. These efforts allow us to rely upon theknowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our existing productsand to develop new products. The departure of any of our key management and technical personnel,the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieveour intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on ourability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others.We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or maybe sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the lawsof the U.S.We believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operationof our businesses as currently contemplated. If the technology we use is found to infringe on protectedtechnology, we could be required to change our business practices, license the protected technology,and/or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party. If we are unable to license protectedtechnology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices, wecould be prohibited from making and selling our products or providing certain telecommunicationsservices.Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to environmentalliabilities.We engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulationsrelating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxicor other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, particularly in the fabrication offiberglass antennas by our Comtech Antenna Systems, Inc. subsidiary. We are also subject to the RoHSdirective which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronicproducts. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result inthe imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processesor cessation of operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.16In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessorsmay have resulted or could in the future result in contamination requiring investigation or remediation,or leading to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business,results of operations and financial condition.Our fiscal 2004 Federal income tax return is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, other returnsmay be selected for audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverseimpact on our results of operations and financial position. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Canada.Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. Although we believeour tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax examinations and any related litigationcould be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.In fiscal 2006, we were informed by the Internal Revenue Service that our Federal income tax returnfor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 was selected for a general tax audit. The audit is in theearly stages and additional income tax returns for other fiscal years may be examined. If the outcomeof the audit differs materially from our original income tax provisions, it could have a materialimpact on our results of operations and financial position.Recently enacted securities laws and regulations are increasing our costs.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosureand compliance practices. For example, the SEC has promulgated newrules on a variety of subjects. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ) hasrevised its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on the NASDAQ. These changesare increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and moreexpensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liabilitycoverage. We believe that these new laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attractand retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee,and qualified executive officers.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Actof 2002. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls, if identified, could indicatea lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required tofurnish a report of managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls aspart of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our auditors are required to attest to and report on managementsassessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internalcontrol design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then wetest and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediatematerial weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controlsnecessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retainsufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demandfor such personnel among publicly traded companies.Changes in financial accounting standards related to stock option expenses are expected to continueto have a significant effect on our reported results.In fiscal 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-BasedPayment, a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in the statementof operations for employee stock options using a fair value method. The adoption of the new standardhad a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provideaccurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factorsused to estimate the value of stock options. As a result, the ongoing application of the new standardcould impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. In addition, since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term equity incentivesas a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options andother long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholdervalue and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the extentthat this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant options to employees, we may incurincreased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract,retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business,results of operations and financial condition. 17We face risks from the uncertainty of prevailing economic and political conditions.Current global political and economic conditions are uncertain. As a result, it is difficult to estimatethe level of expansion, if any, for the global or U.S. economies generally or the markets in whichwe participate. Because our budgeting and forecasting process relies on estimates of growth in themarkets we serve, the current economic environment renders estimates of future income and expenseseven more difficult than usual to formulate. The future direction of the domestic and global economiesand political environment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operationsand financial condition.Terrorist attacks and threats, and government responses thereto, and threats of war elsewhere may negativelyimpact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price.Terrorist attacks, the U.S. governments and other governments responses thereto, and threatsof war could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any escalationin these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customersand may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transportthose materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. In addition, thesecould have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general. Provisions in our corporate documents, stockholder rights plan, and Delaware law could delay or preventa change in control of Comtech.We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventinga merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example,we have a classified board and the employment contract of our chief executive officer provides fora substantial payment in the event of a change of control of Comtech. We also adopted a stockholderrights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase thecost paid by a stockholder, who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.These provisions could prevent us from being acquired. In addition, our certificate of incorporation grantsour Board of Directors the authority to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of and issue upto 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intentionto issue shares of preferred stock, such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stockcould have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or which coulddelay, defer, or prevent a change in control of Comtech. In addition, we are subject to the provisionsof Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statuteprovides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any businesscombination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after thedate of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the businesscombination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes mergers,asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or withinthree years did own, 15% or more of the corporations voting stock. This provision could havethe effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.The higher level of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of our 2.0% convertible senior notes increasesthe risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be able togenerate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital, borrowingsor equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt.The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt;  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions,  capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in  which we compete; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.18Our stock price is volatile.The stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, haveexperienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of anyspecific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in thepast and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significantimpact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the Risk Factors
 section and include:   strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;    future announcements concerning us or our competitors;    receipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;    quality deficiencies in services or products;    results of technological innovations;    new commercial products;    changes in recommendations of securities analysts;    government regulations;    proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;    changes in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunicationssector;    changes in securities market conditions, generally;    energy blackouts;    acts of terrorism or war;    inflation or deflation; and    rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices. Shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securitiesanalysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.We have never declared or paid cash dividends.We have never declared or paid a cash dividend and do not intend to declare any cash dividends on ourcommon stock in the foreseeable future"
