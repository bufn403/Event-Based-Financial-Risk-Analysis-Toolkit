Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and OperationsOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.Our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments. We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.Below is a summary of our most significant sources of competition. Many of these competitors offer competitive pricing, packaging and/or bundling of services to customers, which further increases competition. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.•Connectivity & Platforms’ broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services); electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks; and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see “—We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses” below and Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.•Competition for video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other OTT service providers and aggregators, DBS providers and telecommunications companies, and our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers.•Business Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers.•Our businesses in Content & Experiences, as well as our video business, face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment, including from social networking and user-generated content, and recreational activities. They must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming), advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has further intensified as certain DTC streaming and other OTT service providers have commissioned, and may continue to commission, high-cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs.Competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. Further, consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer free or lower cost DTC streaming and other OTT services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services or to bundle DTC streaming and other OTT services on their platform. Our businesses’ ability to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. For example, some of these constituencies may have their own, and some have conflicting, environmental, social and governance priorities, which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment.Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further challenge existing business models and increase the number of competitors that our businesses face. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K20Table of ContentsAs consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services in lieu of our linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, the number of video customers we have, the related video revenues and the amount of subscriber fees we receive for our linear television networks from other video service providers each decrease. The continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers, rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels, continues to disrupt traditional media distribution business models despite our efforts to adapt our video service offerings and offer new services, such as Peacock and NOW.The number of entertainment choices available to consumers, such as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms, and gaming and virtual reality products and services, continue to significantly increase, intensify audience fragmentation and disaggregate the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. This in turn has reduced traditional television viewership, and when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, has caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. In addition, as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. On the other hand, this practice may also negatively impact our results of operations when we keep our content for our own use, including for Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties who pay us licensing fees for such content.Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.We compete for the sale of advertising time with television networks and stations, digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and a broad array of other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, and all other advertising platforms. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and we expect that a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social networking and user-generated content platforms and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, increased use of time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies or regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, and economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, including DTC streaming service providers and other online content providers, and this trend may continue or accelerate. Lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of our linear television networks have experienced, and likely will continue to experience, as well as the level of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.We create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways, and to meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks’ results of operations as the media distribution business model continues to change.We obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests. For example, content creators have launched, and may continue to launch, their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.21Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsEntering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.Programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Residential Connectivity & Platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to offset programming cost increases through rate increases, the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.The loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.Our linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to our television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes. Similarly, multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics. In addition, our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either “must-carry” status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or “retransmission consent,” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider.For all of these types of arrangements, our ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our businesses.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K22Table of ContentsIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of our businesses, and our success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content we create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. The legal landscape for new technologies, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), remains uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against unauthorized third-party use, misappropriation, reproduction or infringement.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for our businesses. For example, certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation, and sporting events on our international networks may be illegally transmitted. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. We also rely on third-party satellite transponder capacity to provide video services in Europe, as well as on third-party wireless networks to offer certain wireless services in the United States and internationally. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents, or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, how we create our entertainment products, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies (including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services) continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies and create more competitors for our businesses. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds, and some providers offer newer satellite broadband services. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers or that enhance our business operations, such as through the use of AI, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speeds by leveraging our DOCSIS 4.0 technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platforms. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.23Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsA cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering and other malicious activities. Incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.Cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. For example, we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques (such as AI) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors’ systems and other technologies. We also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, that in many cases is provided or made available to third-party vendors who agree to protect it, which has in the past and may in the future become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks with respect to such third-party suppliers and service providers and their products and services. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused, and may from time to time in the future cause, a variety of business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise or exfiltration of confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data, and reputational impacts. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. In addition, any such events have and could continue to lead to litigation or cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations. Refer to Item 1C: Cybersecurity for additional information.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States, in Europe or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services, including advertising, and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions.Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K24Table of ContentsWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as higher interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.Natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Our services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and fines, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others. For example, COVID-19 and corresponding governmental measures negatively impacted our businesses in the past, including as recently as in 2022 by requiring temporary closures of our theme parks.The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.25Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, Content & Experiences depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of the writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees in our Content & Experiences business, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Many of these collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. For example, the Writers Guild of America (“Writers Guild”) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG”) work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, paused productions, which reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages in the future.In addition, labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses.Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance MattersWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, with some also subject to international laws and regulations. In particular, the Communications Act and FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the United States. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. Legislative and regulatory activity has increased under the Biden Administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet/net neutrality requirements. Comcast 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K26Table of ContentsFederal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. For example, the FCC has proposed reimposing network neutrality requirements that would reclassify our broadband service as a “telecommunications service” under Title II of the Communications Act, which would authorize the FCC to potentially regulate our customer rates, speeds, data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and prohibit, or seriously restrict, arrangements between us and internet content, applications and service providers. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs. In addition, U.S. and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium"

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and OperationsOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments. We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.Below is a summary of our most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.•Cable Communications’ and Sky’s broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 4G and 5G wireless broadband services and 5G fixed wireless networks), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we agree to receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses in certain areas. Competition for video services offered by Cable Communications and Sky consists primarily of DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, DBS providers and telecommunications companies. Our voice and wireless services primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. Many of our competitors offer bundled products and services with favorable pricing to customers, which has increased competition. •NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers.Consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, that are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.The ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal’s television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications’ broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K24Table of ContentsCable Communications continues to experience accelerated net losses in its video and voice customers. For example, in Europe, more of Sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to NOW, Sky’s DTC streaming service, instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings, enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, and offer new programming, such as Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.The increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, as well as in gaming and virtual reality products and services, also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduces traditional television viewership, coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s television channels or to Peacock. Our results of operations may be impacted as we license our own content exclusively on our content platforms, including Peacock, rather than receiving license revenue from third parties for rights to such content.Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.We compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, increased use of time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, and this trend may continue or accelerate. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal’s networks and some of Sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. Programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications segment and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of Cable Communications’ programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to offset programming cost increases through rate increases, the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment’s results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications’ video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.25Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsNBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.NBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.NBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s television programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses may be adversely affected.The loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.NBCUniversal’s cable television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. In addition, NBCUniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either “must-carry” status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or “retransmission consent,” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers. For all of these types of arrangements, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses.Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K26Table of ContentsLess favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its broadband and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, specific pricing terms of Sky’s wholesale fiber access are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, it would adversely affect Sky’s ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky’s businesses and results of operations.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal’s businesses, and certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation. It also presents similar challenges for Sky’s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.27Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies (including 4G and 5G wireless broadband services and 5G fixed wireless networks) continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speeds by leveraging our DOCSIS 4.0 technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platforms. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.A cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. Incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.Cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors’ systems and other technologies. Moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such third-party suppliers and service providers. Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K28Table of ContentsWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past, and could in the future, cause a variety of potential adverse business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ data, equipment and reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. In addition, any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States, in Europe or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services, including advertising, and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions.Weak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.29Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.Natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Our services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and fines, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others. In addition, COVID-19 and corresponding governmental measures to prevent its spread across the globe have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our businesses. For example, as a result of COVID-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions.The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K30Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance MattersWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, with some also subject to international laws and regulations. In particular, the Communications Act and FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the United States. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. Legislative and regulatory activity has increased under the Biden Administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet/net neutrality requirements. Federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.31Comcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsIn addition, labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses.Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium"

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and OperationsThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. In particular, COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations. For example, as a result of COVID-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions. The creation and availability of our film and television programming globally also have been disrupted as a result of COVID-19, such as postponements or cancellations of sporting events, theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production.The impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life, travel protocols and the length of time that such measures remain in place, global economic conditions, current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy. It is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K22Table of ContentsBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.•Cable Communications’ and Sky’s broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications’ video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, DBS providers and telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks. Sky faces competition for its video services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets. Our voice and wireless services primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. Many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable pricing, which has increased competition. •NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.Consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.The ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal’s television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications’ broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.For example, Cable Communications continues to experience net video customer losses. In Europe, more of Sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to NOW, Sky’s DTC streaming service, instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.The increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s television channels or to Peacock.23Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal’s networks and some of Sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications segment and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of Cable Communications’ programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment’s results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications’ video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.NBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.NBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s television programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K24Table of Contentsincluding the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses may be adversely affected.The loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.NBCUniversal’s cable television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. In addition, NBCUniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either “must-carry” status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without generating any compensation to us, or “retransmission consent,” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers. Increasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky license their prior season and library content on third-party distribution platforms, including to DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, these providers may not distribute NBCUniversal’s or Sky’s programming. In addition, at times we have opted to, and expect that we may in the future, not license certain popular owned content to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue. For all of these types of arrangements, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses.Less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its broadband and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, it would adversely affect Sky’s ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky’s businesses and results of operations.25Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsOur businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal’s businesses, and certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation. It also presents similar challenges for Sky’s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. For example, global supply chains in general have been, and may continue to be, disrupted as a result of COVID-19. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K26Table of Contentscould be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways, developing smart televisions using our technology platform, and the operation of Peacock. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.A cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. Incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.Cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors’ systems and other technologies. Moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such third-party suppliers and service providers. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past, and could in the future, cause a variety of potential adverse business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ data, equipment and reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. In addition, any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications’ or Sky’s services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).27Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom’s recent withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.Natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.Our services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and fines, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K28Table of Contentscandidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance MattersWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.While all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our Cable Communications and broadcast television businesses in the United States. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete. Legislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the Biden Administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet/net neutrality requirements. Federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s 29Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentscollective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.In addition, NBCUniversal’s Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium"

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and OperationsThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. While our Cable Communications results were strong in 2020, they were negatively affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people increasingly worked and learned remotely from home. COVID-19 had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations during 2020. For example, in late February we temporarily closed our theme park in Japan, and in mid-March we temporarily closed our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood, and although our parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June 2020, our park in Hollywood remains closed. We cannot predict when the Hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or estimate attendance levels at any of the parks. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term. The creation and availability of our film and television programming globally have been and will continue to be disrupted, including as a result of the postponement or cancellation of sporting events (such as the professional soccer, hockey, baseball and basketball leagues and the Olympics), theatrical closures and the suspension of entertainment content production. We expect any continued deterioration of global economic conditions would result in lower advertising revenues and consumer spending across our businesses.The impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life and the length of time that such measures remain in place to respond to COVID-19, further deterioration of the global economy and the widespread availability of a vaccine. At this point, it is impossible to predict such extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.21Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Some established DTC streaming and other OTT service providers have become core competitors to our video services and more continue to enter the market at a growing pace.For example:•Cable Communications’ and Sky’s high-speed internet services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS providers. Competition for Cable Communications’ video services consists primarily of DBS providers, phone companies with fiber-based networks and increasingly DTC streaming and other OTT service providers and devices, each of which typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours, including bundled offers with high-speed internet services. Sky faces competition for its services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets, many of which offer customers bundled services, which has increased competition. •NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, content (including sports programming) and other resources required to operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming to attract viewers.For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.Consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources and efficiencies of scale who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, consolidation or cooperation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.The ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.While we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses, such as by growing high-speed internet services and business services and by investing in Peacock as the media and entertainment landscape continues to rapidly evolve, there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks decrease, even as Cable Communications’ high-speed internet services become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.For example, in Europe, as more of Sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to Sky’s DTC streaming service instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our high-speed internet services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms and Flex, which more easily aggregate content from linear (i.e., traditional television channels) and Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K22Table of ContentsDTC streaming and other OTT services for our customers, and by launching Peacock, our DTC streaming service, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.The increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. NBCUniversal’s revenue relatedly may be negatively impacted as traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which pay NBCUniversal fees based on their respective numbers of customers, lose customers. Time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, reduce viewership, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels. Consumers in many cases have multiple options for viewing the same content; for example, content may be available through traditional linear platforms, on demand services, or a DTC streaming or OTT service, which may also result in audience rating declines. Reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s programming channels.Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of NBCUniversal’s networks and some of Sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as through DTC streaming or other OTT service providers or delayed viewing through DVR or on demand services, might not be fully counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications segment and to increase for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as on demand or streaming services. Additionally, Cable Communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment’s results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communication’s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.NBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our 23Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content at NBCUniversal and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. We also are incurring significant costs to develop Peacock, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering.NBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests (for example, they may launch DTC streaming or other OTT services for their owned content, forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers or they may license their content on an exclusive basis to certain of our competitors or rival DTC streaming or other OTT service providers).Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability of NBCUniversal to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses may be adversely affected.The loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.NBCUniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers. NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s ability to renew these agreements on favorable terms may be affected by recent industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms.Increasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky license their prior season and library content on third party distribution platforms, including to DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, these providers may not distribute NBCUniversal’s or Sky’s programming, and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers may not license programming NBCUniversal or Sky creates (or license it at reduced rates). In addition, we expect not to license certain popular content, and we may decide not to license additional owned popular content, to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.NBCUniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either “must-carry” status, in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or “retransmission consent,” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses.Less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K24Table of Contentsaccesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its high-speed internet and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, this would adversely affect Sky’s ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky’s businesses and results of operations.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses, and certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. It also presents similar challenges for Sky’s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may 25Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsdiscontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications’ or Sky’s services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for high-speed internet and voice services, such as mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depend on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).Weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt. If our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions, we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected. Further, a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound and Euro, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways and the development of Peacock. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K26Table of ContentsWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. Cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. In addition, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future. The occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition, we obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third-party’s information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.The risk of systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systems-related events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, we have experienced systems-related events and breaches in the past, and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.27Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance MattersWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.While all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our Cable Communications and Broadcast Television businesses in the United States. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statues, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend likely will continue. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete. Legislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the 2020 U.S. presidential election. For example, the U.S. Congress may consider proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiatives. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws and United States and foreign policymakers could enact new competition laws or regulatory enforcement options that could negatively impact our businesses. With the change in administration, tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21%. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.Comcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K28Table of ContentsIn addition, NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television networks and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB and European football games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock.

2,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2020-01-30,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. OTT service providers continue to proliferate, complicating the competitive landscape by influencing consumer behavior and challenging existing business models, which is discussed in more detail in the risk factor immediately below.For example:•Competition for Cable Communications’ video, high-speed internet and voice services consists primarily of phone companies with fiber-based networks and DBS providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours. Sky faces competition for its video, high-speed internet and voice services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets, many of which offer customers bundled services, which has increased competition. Increasingly, additional companies, some with significant financial resources or fewer regulatory burdens, have entered, or are seeking to enter, the video distribution market by offering OTT streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various OTT services. Many OTT service providers offer smaller packages of channels or subscriptions to access programming at price points lower than our standard packages or for free, which adversely affects demand for Cable Communications’ and Sky’s traditional DTH video services, including for expanded video packages, premium networks, and DVR and On Demand services. •Cable Communications’ and Sky’s high-speed internet services compete primarily against phone companies with fiber-based networks offering speeds and pricing comparable to ours. Wireless internet services, such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services, satellite-delivered internet services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as smartphones, tablets, wireless data cards, and mobile and fixed wireless routers that connect to such services, also may compete with our high-speed internet services, particularly as wireless technology evolves. Some municipalities in the United States own and operate their own broadband networks and additional municipalities may do so in the future.•NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities.•NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, content and other resources required to operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming to attract viewers.For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.Consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, consolidation or cooperation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.The ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, employees, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.While we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses, such as by growing high-speed internet services and business services and by investing in new theme parks and Peacock, there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These distribution platforms have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content. 20Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsConsumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which is reducing the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks even as it makes Cable Communications’ high-speed internet services more important to consumers. These changing consumer behaviors also are occurring in Europe, as more of Sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to Sky’s OTT video service instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our high-speed internet services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms and Flex, which can more easily aggregate linear and OTT programming choices for our customers, the continuing trend of OTT service providers delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional video distribution business models.The increase in OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. Time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels. Reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s programming channels.Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital media, radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have increasingly shifted their expenditures to digital media and their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of NBCUniversal’s networks and some of Sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as through OTT services or delayed viewing through DVR or on demand services, might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes and wireless gateways. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K21 Table of ContentsWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.In the United States, federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the high-speed internet, video and voice services industries. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by U.S. laws and regulations. NBCUniversal’s other businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels. Sky’s business is subject to various telecommunications and media-specific regulations where it operates. The FCC, FTC and certain state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend likely will continue. In addition, regulators and the courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws as new competition law theories emerge. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.Legislators and regulators at all levels of government, including foreign authorities, frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statues, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may address communications and other issues that could significantly affect our businesses. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings regarding our services, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome. For example, some states have passed or introduced legislation or executive orders that impose various open internet and data privacy requirements. Such attempts by the states to regulate portions of our businesses have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. These requirements and any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications and Sky segments and to increase for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as on demand or streaming services. Additionally, Cable Communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications and Sky segments’ results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, if renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications’ or Sky’s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.NBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content at NBCUniversal and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. We also are incurring significant costs to develop Peacock, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering.NBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s  22Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsprogramming channels if media companies launch successful OTT services for their owned content such that they forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers.Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability of NBCUniversal to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses may be adversely affected.The loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.NBCUniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers.Increasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky are entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including OTT services. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may not distribute NBCUniversal’s or Sky’s programming, and OTT services may not license programming NBCUniversal or Sky creates. In addition, we expect not to license certain popular content, and we may decide not to license additional popular content that we own, to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.NBCUniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either “must-carry” status, in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or “retransmission consent,” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. However, certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses.Less favorable telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regimes in the U.K. and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its high-speed internet and phone services, in most cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in the U.K, Italy or other markets where Sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is unable to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on commercially reasonable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky’s businesses and results of operations.We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K23 Table of ContentsCyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. In addition, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future. The occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition, we obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third-party’s information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.The risk of systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systems-related events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, we have experienced systems-related events and breaches in the past, and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates  24Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsthe creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. It also presents similar challenges for Sky’s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications’ or Sky’s services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as OTT video services, or substitute services for high-speed internet and voice services, such as mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. Weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt. If our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions, we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected. Further, a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, including our 2018 acquisition of Sky and the development of Peacock and new theme parks. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound and Euro, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange Comcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K25 Table of Contentsrate fluctuations. Sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders.

4,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2019-01-31,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Online video distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.”Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K21 Table of ContentsCompetition for Cable Communications’ cable services consists primarily of phone companies with fiber-based networks and DBS providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours. Some of these competitors are also offering smaller packages of channels at price points lower than our standard packages, both through traditional and online video distribution platforms, which could cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable. Consolidation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers in the United States provides competitors with the ability to offer free or lower cost streaming services for viewing their content, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for their internet or wireless phone services. Additional companies, some with significant financial resources, continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market, either by offering OTT streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various OTT services.Sky faces competition in video, high-speed internet and voice services from cable and/or telecommunications providers in each of its European markets. More providers in Europe now offer customers bundles of services, which has increased competition. The intensity of this competition has increased in recent years, including as a result of OTT streaming services. Cable Communications’ and Sky’s high-speed internet services compete primarily against phone companies with fiber-based networks offering speeds and pricing comparable to ours. Wireless internet services, such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services, satellite-delivered internet services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as smartphones, tablets, wireless data cards, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, also may compete with our high-speed internet services, particularly as wireless technology evolves. Some municipalities in the United States own and operate their own broadband networks, and additional municipalities may do so as well. Cable Communications’ and Sky’s wireline voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and internet-based phone services.We continue to seek ways to enhance the value of Cable Communications’ cable services network, such as by growing high-speed internet services and business services and by launching additional services, such as our security and automation services. Sky also is seeking ways to enhance the value of its services. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our Cable Communications or Sky segment revenue, maintain Cable Communications or Sky segment operating margins or to compete successfully in the future.Each of NBCUniversal’s businesses and Sky also face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, content and other resources required in operating these businesses.The ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or newer competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.Consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks even as it makes Cable Communications’ high-speed internet services more important to consumers. While these changes are primarily affecting our U.S. businesses today, there can be no assurance that they will not also affect Sky’s businesses to a similar extent in the future, even with Sky offering a standalone OTT video streaming service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings to changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 platform and adding apps such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on set-top boxes, virtual multichannel video providers, online video distributors and programming networks providing their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through traditional video distribution services continue to emerge, gain consumer acceptance and disrupt traditional video distribution services. Many of these service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than traditional video packages for access to their content, which could have an adverse effect on demand for Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video services, including for expanded video packages, premium networks, and DVR and On Demand services.     22Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsAn increasing number of companies offering OTT streaming services, including some with exclusive high-quality original video programming, as well as programming networks offering content directly to consumers over the internet, have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation. The increase in entertainment choices adversely affects the audience ratings of NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and Sky’s owned television channels. Time-shifting technologies, such as video on demand services and DVR and cloud-based recording services, also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and Sky’s owned television channels, and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount NBCUniversal and Sky receive for distribution of their content.The success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.Our cable communications, cable networks, broadcast television, and Sky businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital media, radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, and audience fragmentation, increased viewing of ad-free content through online video distribution platforms, regulatory intervention regarding where advertising may be placed, or the economy in general. In addition, advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of NBCUniversal’s networks and Sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as viewing content through many online video distribution platforms or delayed viewing on DVRs, might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the U.S. deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS FDX, our X1 and Sky Q set-top boxes, cloud DVR and wireless gateways. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.In the United States, federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the high-speed internet, video and voice services industries. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by U.S. laws and regulations. NBCUniversal’s cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels. Sky’s business is subject to various telecommunications and media-specific regulations in most of the countries where it operates. The FCC and certain state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend likely will continue. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.Legislators and regulators at all levels of government, including foreign authorities, frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statues, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation regarding our services. For example, some states have passed or introduced legislation or executive orders that Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K23 Table of Contentsimpose various open internet and data privacy requirements. Such attempts by the states to regulate portions of our businesses have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. These requirements and any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. The U.S. Congress may consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications and Sky segments and to increase for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as On Demand or streaming services. Additionally, Cable Communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications and Sky segments’ results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, if renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications’ or Sky’s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.Most of NBCUniversal’s, as well as Sky’s, businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute NBCUniversal’s cable network and broadcast television programming, Sky’s owned television channels, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television networks and Sky’s owned television channels, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which it will earn consumer acceptance.NBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, including in the case of Sky, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for NBCUniversal’s content, and the timing and amount of rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses may be adversely affected. 24Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsThe loss of NBCUniversal’s programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.NBCUniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. Increasingly, NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses are entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including subscription video on demand services. If NBCUniversal’s programming does not attract sufficient viewers, traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute NBCUniversal’s broadcast and cable networks, and OTT video streaming services may not license programming we create. In addition, the number of subscribers to NBCUniversal’s cable networks has been, and may continue to be reduced, as a result of multichannel video providers offering smaller packages of channels as part of their virtual or traditional television programming packages and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video providers. NBCUniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either “must-carry” status, in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or “retransmission consent,” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. However, certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. There can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce NBCUniversal’s revenues and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses.Less favorable regulation, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky relies on various telecommunications providers to deliver its video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the U.K. and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunication providers to provide its high-speed internet and phone services, in most cases, on regulated terms, including price. These regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, pricing terms are not regulated. If Sky is unable to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on commercially reasonable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates.  The loss of Sky’s wholesale distribution agreements with traditional multichannel video providers could adversely affect Sky’s businesses. Sky benefits from its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with traditional multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that any of its distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce Sky’s revenues and the reach of its television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect Sky’s businesses.Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K25 Table of ContentsWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. Cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. In addition, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future. The occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition, we obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and may in some cases provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third-party’s information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.The risk of systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches. We have experienced minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our products, services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material  26Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsnegatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. It also presents similar challenges for Sky’s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications’ cable services or Sky’s services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as OTT video services, or substitute services for high-speed internet and voice services, such as mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. Weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt. If our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions, we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected. Further, a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, including our 2018 acquisition of Sky and 2017 launch of a wireless phone service using virtual network operator rights. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives, or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.We are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K27 Table of Contentsdamage, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment and Sky businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We, primarily through Sky and NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom’s referendum to withdraw membership from the EU (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur, our businesses may be adversely affected. 28Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium"
3,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2018-01-31,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Online distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.”Competition for our cable services consists primarily of DBS providers and phone companies with fiber-based networks that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours. Some of these competitors are also offering smaller packages of channels at price points lower than our standard packages, both through traditional and online distribution platforms, which could cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable. AT&T, our largest phone company competitor, acquired DirecTV, the nation’s largest DBS provider, in 2015 to create an even larger competitor, and in 2016, announced a proposed merger with Time Warner, a media and entertainment company. If consolidation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers occurs, some of our competitors may offer free or lower cost streaming services for viewing their content through unlimited data-usage plans for their Internet or wireless phone services. Additional companies, some with significant financial resources, continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market, primarily by offering Internet streaming and downloading of video programming.Wireless Internet services, such as 3G and 4G, and in the near future 5G, wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as smartphones, tablets, wireless data cards, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our wireline voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and Internet-based phone services.Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to enhance the value of our cable services network, such as by growing our high-speed Internet services and business services and by launching additional services, such as our security and automation services. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our Cable Communications segment revenue, maintain our Cable Communications segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future.Each of NBCUniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, content and other resources required in operating these businesses.The ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or newer competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section. 20Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsChanges in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.Distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the Internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services.Consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed Internet services more important to consumers. While we are attempting to adapt our video service offerings to changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying our X1 platform and cloud DVR technology and adding apps such as Netflix on our X1 set-top boxes, virtual multichannel video providers, subscription video on demand services and programming networks that provide content directly to consumers over the Internet continue to gain consumer acceptance. Many of these service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video services, including for expanded video packages, premium networks, and our DVR and On Demand services.    An increasing number of companies offering subscription video on demand services, including some that also offer exclusive high-quality original video programming, as well as programming networks offering content directly to consumers over the Internet, have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation. The increase in entertainment choices adversely affects the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming. Time-shifting technologies, such as video on demand services and DVR and cloud-based recording services, also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our cable networks and broadcast television programming and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount NBCUniversal receives for distribution of its content.The success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.A decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital media, radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and audience fragmentation, the growing use of new technologies and online distribution platforms, or the economy in general. In addition, advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as viewing content through many online distribution platforms or delayed viewing on DVRs, might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, current and new wireless Internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast Internet access speeds. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS FDX and the continued development of our X1 set-top boxes, cloud DVR and wireless gateways. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures.Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K21 Table of ContentsWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video, high-speed Internet and voice services industries. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations. Our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels. In addition, we are subject to conditions relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters set forth in the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which is currently scheduled to expire in September 2018. The FCC and certain states also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services, and this trend may continue. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. Congress may consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent open Internet requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure. We are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our Cable Communications segment’s video business.We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our Cable Communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase for the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming, especially sports programming, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as On Demand or streaming services. Additionally, in the past few years, we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment’s results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.NBCUniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.Most of NBCUniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content, and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the  22Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsother costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.The loss of NBCUniversal’s programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect its businesses.Our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses are also entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including subscription video on demand services. If our programming does not attract sufficient viewers, traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute our broadcast and cable networks, and subscription video on demand services may not license programming we create. In addition, the number of subscribers to our cable networks may be reduced as a result of multichannel video providers offering smaller packages of channels as part of their virtual or traditional television programming packages and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either “must-carry” status, in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or “retransmission consent,” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. However, certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. There can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce NBCUniversal’s revenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses.We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. Cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition, we may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and may provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K23 Table of Contentsor our products, services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal’s businesses, and its success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation - Other Areas of Regulation - Intellectual Property” discussion for additional information.We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected.Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as subscription video on demand services, or substitute services for our high-speed Internet and voice services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative  24Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsimpact on our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us, and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance any existing debt on acceptable terms.Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. For example, our launch of a wireless phone service in 2017 using virtual network operator rights has success-based working capital requirements, primarily associated with the procurement of handsets, which customers are able to pay for upfront or finance interest-free over 24 months, and other equipment, which could have negative effects on our cash flows. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or DOJ, may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives, or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses.Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.Many of NBCUniversal’s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent. If we fail to retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.Comcast 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K25 Table of ContentsOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium"
14,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2017-02-03,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do notcompete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments andcompete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating thecompetitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content mayadversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.  Competition for our cable services consists primarily ofDBS providers and phone companies with fiber-based networks that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.

Additional companies, some with significant financial resources, continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market, primarily by offering online video programmingservices that can be viewed live, through streaming services or by downloading.  Current and future wireless Internet services, such as3G, 4G and 5G wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with ourhigh-speed Internet services. Our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and Internet-based phone services.  Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to enhance the value of our cable services network, such as by growing our high-speed Internet and business services businesses and by launching additionalservices, such as our home security and automation services. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our Cable Communications segment revenue, maintain our CableCommunications segment operating margin, or to compete successfully in the future.  Each of NBCUniversals businesses also facessubstantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required inoperating these businesses.  The ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputationamong our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will nothave an adverse effect on our businesses. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the Competition discussion within that section. Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses andchallenge existing business models.  New technologies and platforms for the distribution, sale and viewing of content have been, andwill likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These technologies and distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior asconsumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services.  While our cablecommunications business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and apps such as Netflix on our X1 set top boxes, new and traditional competitors, as well as someprogramming networks, continue to launch subscription video on demand services, live online broadcast and cable television streaming services and downloading services that can be viewed on television sets, computers, smartphones and tablets. Many ofthese service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video services, including for expanded digital video packages, premiumnetworks, and our DVR and On Demand services.  New technologies and distribution platforms, together with an increasing number ofcompanies offering their content directly to consumers over the Internet, including some that also offer exclusive high-quality original    Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26 Table of Contentsvideo programming, have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation. The increase in entertainment choices has and maycontinue to reduce the number of subscribers to our cable networks. Time-shifting technologies, such as DVRs and cloud-based recording services and video on demand services, reduce the viewing of content through traditional linear televisiondistribution outlets. Reduced viewing of our content through traditional linear television distribution outlets has caused and will likely continue to cause audience ratings declines for NBCUniversals linear television content and mayadversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount NBCUniversal receives for distribution of its content.  The success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, could have anadverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.  A decline in advertisers expenditures orchanges in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.  Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcasttelevision businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital media, as well as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from thesale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specificadvertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and audience fragmentation, the growing use of new technologies, or the economy in general. In addition, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from usmay be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could benegatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as delayed viewing on DVRs or viewing content online, might not be counted in audience measurements or maygenerate less, if any, revenue than traditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Reductions in advertisers expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses. Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and ourcompetitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, current and new wireless Internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly toallow for greater speed and reliability, and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast Internet access speeds. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. Ifwe choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively onour technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1, X1 set-top boxes, wireless gateways and cloud DVR technology, and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to competesuccessfully in the future. We also may incur increased costs if changes in our competitors product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we makeadditional research and development expenditures.     27 Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may imposeadditional costs and restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video, high-speedInternet and voice services industries. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations. Our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws andregulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. Inaddition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. In recent years, the FCC and certain statesalso have been more active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend may continue. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcementactions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the Legislation and Regulation discussionwithin that section.  Changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, couldhave an adverse effect on our businesses.  Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, andsometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. In addition, in recent years, the FCC and certain states have been more active inconsidering rulemakings and legislation regarding our services. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. Inaddition, Congress is expected to consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should address theFCCs authority to implement or enforce open Internet regulations, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure. We are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses,nor can we predict how the FCC or other agencies under the new Administration will address regulatory matters affecting our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have anegative impact on our businesses and results of operations.  Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which couldadversely affect our Cable Communications segments video business.  We expect programming expenses for our video services tocontinue to be our Cable Communications segments largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming, especially sportsprogramming, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional deliveryplatforms, such as On Demand or streaming services. Additionally, in the past few years, we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programmingto our video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the mediaindustry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverseeffect on our Cable Communications segments results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in whichcase we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.    Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28 Table of ContentsNBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, and its businesses maybe adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.  Most of NBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. Thesuccess of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changingpreferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial funds in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast televisionnetworks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.  We alsoobtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, andwe may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs.Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size,the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content, and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts willexceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptableterms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.  The loss of NBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, orthe renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect its businesses.  Our cable networks depend on theirability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, and if a network does not attract sufficient viewers, multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute the network. Our broadcast television networksdepend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years,each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either must-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station ismandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with thedistributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through December 31, 2017.Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including subscription video on demandservices, and some multichannel video providers are offering smaller packages of channels as part of their streaming and linear television programming packages. In addition, certain online entities may stream our broadcast television content onlinewithout our consent and without paying any compensation to us. As a result, there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or therenewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce our distribution revenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcasttelevision and filmed entertainment businesses.     29 Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and adisruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses. Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations andprogramming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, including those caused by us or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructiveor disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terroristattacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our theme parks or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. These eventsalso could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, andmay provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, suchas misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expendsignificant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business, and our lines ofbusiness may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers. Inthe ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation ordisruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate a comprehensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, thedevelopment, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite any efforts to preventthese events and security breaches, there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any suchevents or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have anadverse effect on our business.  We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations andfinancial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectivelymitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the   Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of Contentsequipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected. Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economicconditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinuesubscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as subscription video on demand services, or substitute services for our high-speed Internetand voice services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and homeentertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us, and any disruption in theglobal financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance any existing debt on acceptable terms.  Ourbusinesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.  We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies,conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements onunfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to changeour business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can betime-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, ourbusinesses could be adversely affected.  In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value ofNBCUniversals businesses, and its success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorizedreproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costsdue to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.  Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, andthe enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing ofhigh-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and otherplatforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developedcopyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed orweakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may    31 Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsbe negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Item 1: Business and refer to the Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation Intellectual Property discussion for additional information.  Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks,and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.  From time to time, we make acquisitions andinvestments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, including, for example, with respect to our wireless strategy. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipatedbenefits, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions orinitiatives. For example, our launch of a wireless phone service in 2017 using virtual network operator rights from a third party will have success-based working capital requirements, primarily associated with the procurement of handsets and otherequipment, as we launch the service, which could have negative effects on our cash flows. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or DOJ, may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatoryapprovals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives, or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses. Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses. Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as wellas some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreements are industry-wideagreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered bythat agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that wewill renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.  In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events,including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.  The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses. We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for keymanagement personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have anegative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent. If we failto retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, ourbusinesses could be adversely affected.  We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect ourbusinesses.  We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing businessinternationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and the global economic    Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of Contentsslowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display andsale of advertising; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws andregulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign CorruptPractices Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.  Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our companythrough his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.  Our Class B common stock has anondilutable 33 1/3% ofthe combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was thenumber of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in theform of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even ifthey are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving ComcastCorporation, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of thecombined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and,accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.     33 Comcast 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents"
9,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2016-02-05,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
  Our businesses currently facea wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products andservices and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed in the risk factor immediatelybelow in Changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.     25 Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsCompetition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of companies that typically offerfeatures, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our video, high-speed Internet and voice services, such as DBS providers and phone companies with fiber-based networks. In 2015, AT&T, our largest phone company competitor, acquiredDirecTV, the nations largest DBS provider, which created an even larger competitor.  Wireless Internet services, such as 4Gwireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice servicescontinue to face increased competition from wireless and Internet-based phone services as more consumers choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. There also continue to be new entrants, some with significant financial resources, that potentially may compete with our cable services. Inparticular, Google, which has launched high-speed Internet and video services in a limited number of areas, has announced plans to expand in more areas, including in some of our significant markets. As Google expands to more areas, we expect it tobecome a meaningful wireline competitor to our high-speed Internet and video services. In addition, some local municipalities are launching their own fiber-based high-speed Internet services. Companies that provide subscription video on demandservices over the Internet or the ability to download video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance. There can be no assurance that these or other newer entrants will not continue to launch similar services. Our cable communications business continues to seek ways enhance the value of our cable services network, such as by growing our high-speedInternet and business services businesses and by launching additional services, such as our home security and automation services. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow ormaintain our Cable Communications segment revenue, maintain our Cable Communications segment operating margin, or to compete successfully in the future.  In addition, some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities and may expand their service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings. Because we do not have our own wirelessfacilities, our inability to provide a competitive wireless product as part of our bundled cable services offering could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, business and results of operations. Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well asfrom other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. All of our businesses ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies,including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. There can be no assurance that wewill be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business andrefer to the Competition discussion within that section.  Changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods forviewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.  Alternative products and services forthe distribution, sale and viewing of content have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These products and services arealso driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services.    Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26 Table of ContentsWhile our cable communications business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, forexample, by deploying our X1 platform and Cloud DVR technology, products and services have emerged that compete with our video services, including those that offer subscription video on demand services or the ability to download content that can beviewed on television sets, computers, smartphones and tablets. Some of these products and services charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content, which adversely affects demand for our video services,including for expanded digital video packages, premium networks, and our DVR and On Demand services.  The increased availability ofthese products and services, including some that also offer high-quality original video programming that is exclusive to that service, have contributed to an increased number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which intensifiesaudience fragmentation. Additionally, the increased availability of DVRs and cloud-based recording services and video on demand services reduces the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlets. Reduced viewing ofour content through traditional linear television distribution outlets has caused and will likely continue to cause audience ratings declines for NBCUniversals linear television content and may adversely affect the price and amount ofadvertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount NBCUniversal receives for distribution of its content. Additionally, several companies now offer smaller packages of channels directly to customers over the Internet at price points lower than ourstandard packages, which could adversely affect demand for our video services and reduce the subscription revenue that our cable networks or broadcast television businesses receive from multichannel video providers. These smaller packages could alsocause our cable communications business to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable.  The success of anyof these ongoing and future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position,businesses and results of operations.  A decline in advertisers expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negativelyimpact our businesses.  Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale ofadvertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio, print and, increasingly, digital media. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline inexpenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increasedcompetition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or the economy in general. In addition, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected bylower audience ratings, which some of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement methodologies and could be negatively affected if methodologies do notaccurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as delayed viewing on DVRs or viewing content online, might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue thantraditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Reductions in advertisers expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses. Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and ourcompetitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide     27 Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsthem with a competitive advantage. For example, some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast Internet access speeds, and wireless Internettechnologies continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive toconsumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could beadversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1, X1 set-top boxes, wireless gateways and Cloud DVR technology, and there can be no assurance that wecan execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer requirethat we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures.  We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses. Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video and voice services industry, and more recently, Internet services. We expectthat legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases may adversely affect, the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Ourbroadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations. Our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, stateand local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. In addition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Orderand the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result inadministrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1, Business and refer to the Legislation andRegulation discussion within that section.  Changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, oradoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on our businesses.  Legislators and regulators at all levels of governmentfrequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. In addition, the FCC and certain states are becoming moreactive in considering rulemakings and legislation, as well as in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additionalrestrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. For example, as more fully discussed in Item 1, Business  Legislation and Regulation, in 2015, the FCC adopted new open Internet regulations that reclassifybroadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service, making it subject to certain common carriage regulations under Title II of the Communications Act. This change could have a material adverse effect on our business andresults of operations. In addition, in 2015, the FCC adopted an order that preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks. The FCC is also considering the appropriate regulatoryframework for VoIP service, including whether that service should be regulated under Title II. Accordingly, the legal and regulatory environment applicable to our businesses continues to intensify. Any changes to the legal and regulatory frameworkapplicable to any of our services or businesses could have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations.    Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28 Table of ContentsProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our CableCommunications segments video business.  We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our CableCommunications segments largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming, especially sports programming, which weexpect will continue for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as OnDemand or streaming services. Additionally, in the past few years, we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video servicescustomers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which mayfurther increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our CableCommunications segments results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may beunable to provide such content as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. NBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails toachieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.  Most of NBCUniversals businessescreate and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create,acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. We haveinvested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning theextent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.  We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such asmovie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid byour competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programmingrights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, and the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges orobtain carriage on, multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs ofproducing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected. The loss of NBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms,could adversely affect its businesses.  Our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreementswith multichannel video providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliatedlocal broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its    29 Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsDMA, either must-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, orretransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to thestation by such distributor. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through December 31, 2017. Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainmentbusinesses have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including subscription video on demand services, and some multichannel video providers are offering smaller packages ofchannels as part of their streaming and linear television programming packages. In addition, certain online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. As a result, therecan be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce our distributionrevenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure ordestruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.  Network and information systems andother technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, including those caused by us or bythird parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or anycombination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment, data andproperties. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could have an adverse effect onour results of operations.  In addition, we may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers,personnel and vendors, and may provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised.Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputationand require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business, and our lines ofbusiness may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers. Inthe ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced a few minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradationor disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate a comprehensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring,the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite any efforts toprevent these events and security breaches,    Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of Contentsthere can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against lossesresulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or securitybreaches could have an adverse effect on our business.  We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operationalsupport.  We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational supportnecessary to provide certain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitorthe operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we couldeffectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or providethe equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected.  Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.  A substantial portionof our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results ofoperations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower costcompetitive services, such as subscription video on demand services, or substitute services for our high-speed Internet and voice services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negativeimpact on our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks business. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair theability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us, and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing, including refinancing any existing debt, on acceptable terms. Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights ofothers.  We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses andother agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringementby third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question orfrom the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain orcontinue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversals businesses, and its success is highlydependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction,dis-    31 Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentstribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection withour content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. For example, NBCUniversal has brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR.Additionally, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislationwould ultimately affect our businesses.  Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement ofintellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorizedcopies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmedentertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures likethose in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to newtechnologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Item 1, Business and refer tothe Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Property discussion for additional information.  Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated. From time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, including, for example, with respect to awireless strategy. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationshipswith current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or DOJ, may impose restrictions on theoperation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses. Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses. Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as wellas some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and wemay lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement mayhave a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew ourcollective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.  Inaddition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLBgames. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.    Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of ContentsThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverseeffect on our businesses.  We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintainlong-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one ormore of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent.If we fail to retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adverselyaffected.  We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses. We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including globalfinancial market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content andthe display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local laborlaws and regulations, and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.  Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company throughhis beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.  Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reducedbelow 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class Bcommon stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions,even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving ComcastCorporation, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of thecombined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit therights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potentialability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.     33 Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents"
16,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2015-02-27,">Item 1A: RiskFactors  Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adverselyaffected if we do not compete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidlychanging environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying andcomplicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below in Changes in consumer behavior driven by newer products and services may adversely affect our businesses andchallenge existing business models.  Cable Communications  Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of companies that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services, such as:     DBS providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas       phone companies with fiber-based networks, which overlap a significant portion of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks      other providers of traditional cable services in some of our service areas and SMATV systems   Some of our phone company competitors also have their own wireless facilities andmay expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings, which may have an adverse impact on our competitive position, business and results of operations. In May 2014, AT&T, our largest phone company competitor, announcedits intention to acquire DirecTV, the nations largest DBS provider; if completed, this transaction will create an even larger competitor for our cable services.  There continue to be new entrants, some with significant financial resources, that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services. These newer entrants, some of which charge a nominal or no feefor access to their content, include companies that provide subscription video on demand services over the Internet or the ability to download video programming. Additionally, Google has launched high-speed Internet and video services in a limitednumber of areas, and some local municipalities are launching their own fiber-based high-speed Internet services. There can be no assurance that these newer entrants will not continue to launch services in more of our services areas. Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network, such as by expanding and enhancing our businessservices to medium-sized businesses and by launching additional services, such as our home security and automation services. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain ourcable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future.    Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of ContentsNBCUniversal  Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities.NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. For example:      our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations,as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home, such as video games, DVDs and the Internet       our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and onlinedigital distributors       our filmed entertainment business competes with other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the productionof its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters, and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs and for distribution by online digital distributors; it also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all otherforms of entertainment inside and outside the home       our theme parks business competes with other multi-park entertainment companies and with other recreational and tourism activities   All of our businesses ability to compete effectively depends on our perceivedimage and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and governmental authorities. In addition, our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our cable servicescustomers with a satisfactory customer experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. For a more detaileddescription of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1, Business and refer to the Competition discussion within that section.  Changes in consumer behavior driven by newer products and services may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models. Newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content, have been, and will likely continueto be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These products and services are also driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when,where and how they consume content and access communications services.  While our cable communications business is attempting to adaptto changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying our X1 platform and Cloud DVR technology, products and services have emerged that may compete with our video services, including services and devices that offer subscription video on demandservices or the ability to download movies, television shows and other video programming, any of which can be viewed on television sets, computers, smartphones and tablets. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to theircontent, which could adversely affect demand for our video services, including for expanded digital video packages, premium networks, and our DVR and On Demand services. Additionally, one traditional provider of cable services has begun, and othercompanies have indicated they also may begin, to offer smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the Internet at price points lower than our traditional video service package offerings, which could adversely affect demandfor our video services or cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable.     31 Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsNewer services in wireless Internet technology, such as 4G wireless broadband services and Wi-Finetworks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice services continue to face increased competition fromwireless and Internet-based phone services as more consumers choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services.  Newer products and services are also driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services. For example, the increasedavailability of DVRs, video on demand services and cable, broadcast and other video programming on the Internet including high-quality original video programming that may be viewed only through subscription video on demand services, as well asincreased access to media through wireless devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlets. Some content providers are also beginning to offer programming directly to consumersover the Internet for a nominal fee. Reduced viewing of content through traditional distribution outlets could adversely affect demand for our cable communications video services, the price and amount of advertising that advertisers arewilling to purchase from us, the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to NBCUniversal for content, and the levels of DVD and theatrical sales. These newer products and services have contributed to an increased number ofentertainment choices available to consumers, which have caused and may continue to cause audience ratings pressure for our content and intensify the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes inconsumer behavior, including among younger consumers, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, business and results of operations.  A decline in advertisers expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.  Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms,such as radio, print and, increasingly, online media. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negativelyimpact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies,or by the economy in general. In addition, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which some of our cable networks have experienced and may continue to experience.Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement methodologies and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, newer methods of viewing content (such as delayedviewing on DVRs or viewing content online) might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Reductions inadvertisers expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses.  Our businesses depend on keeping pace withtechnological developments.  Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage newand existing technologies, and our competitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks thatprovide very fast Internet access speeds, and wireless Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technologyor equipment that is not as effective or attractive    Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of Contentsto consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technologyinitiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, we may incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of our X1 set-top boxes, wireless gateways and Cloud DVRtechnology, and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may incur increased costs if changes in theproducts and services that our competitors offer require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures, which could have anadverse effect on our businesses.  We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may imposeadditional costs and restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video servicesindustry and may increase the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases may adversely affect, therights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations. Our cable networks, filmed entertainment and themeparks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and thesafety of consumer products and theme park operations. In addition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors andother matters. We are also seeking regulatory approvals from federal, state and local authorities relating to our acquisition of cable systems from Time Warner Cable and Charter and cannot predict what conditions might be applied to any suchapprovals or how such conditions might affect our businesses. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. For a moreextensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1, Business and refer to the Legislation and Regulation discussion within that section. Changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses.  Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existingstatutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additionalrestrictions on our businesses. For example, as more fully discussed in Item 1, Business  Legislation and Regulation, in February 2015, the FCC adopted new open Internet regulations that reclassify broadband Internet serviceas a telecommunications service, making it subject to common carriage regulations under Title II of the Communications Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, in February2015, the FCC adopted an order that preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks. The FCC is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for VoIP service, includingwhether that service should be regulated under Title II. Any changes to the regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations.     33 Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our CableCommunications segments businesses.  We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our CableCommunications segments largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming, especially sports programming, which weexpect will continue for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as OnDemand or mobile apps. Additionally, in the past few years, we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video servicescustomers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by the increasing trend of consolidation in the media industry,which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact onour Cable Communications segments results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case wemay be unable to provide such content as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.  NBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create oracquire content increase.  Most of NBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success ofwhich depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcasttelevision programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts inour content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance. We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sportsorganizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into orrenewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Moreover, particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cashflows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, and the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on, multichannel videoproviders for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. Ifour content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected. The loss of NBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adverselyaffect its businesses.  Our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with multichannelvideo providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network    Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34 Table of Contentsaffiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years,each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either must-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station ismandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with thedistributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. In the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf ofour owned local broadcast television stations. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through December 31, 2017. Our ability to continue to receive compensation fromdistributors as part of our retransmission consent negotiations may be adversely impacted by online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. Increasingly, our cablenetworks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including subscription video on demand services. There can be noassurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce the reach of our televisionprogramming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses.  We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties maydisrupt our businesses.  Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management,customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, including those caused by us or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computerviruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters,terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in large expenditures torepair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future.  Inaddition, we may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and may provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we obtain assurances that thesethird parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in ourinformation technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, and could cause regulators to imposefines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.  The risk of these systems-related events andsecurity breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business, and our lines of business may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintaincertain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced afew minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to preventsystems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and main-    35 Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentstenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite any efforts toprevent these events and security breaches, there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting fromany such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have anadverse effect on our business.  We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations andfinancial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectivelymitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide theequipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected. Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economicconditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinuesubscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as subscription video on demand services, or substitute services for our high-speed Internetand phone services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spendingin our theme parks business. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us, and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect ourability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.  Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rightsand on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.  We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights,trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual propertyrights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently fromfurther use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively andcould have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from ourbusinesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversals businesses, and its success is highlydependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction,dis-   Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36 Table of Contentstribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection withour content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. For example, NBCUniversal has brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR.Additionally, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislationwould ultimately affect our businesses.  Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement ofintellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorizedcopies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmedentertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures likethose in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to newtechnologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Item 1, Business and refer tothe Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Property discussion for additional information.  Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions, including our planned transactions with TimeWarner Cable and Charter. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships withcurrent and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions such as the Time Warner Cable or Charter transactions. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or DOJ,may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect onour businesses.  Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affectour businesses.  Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel andothers, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreements are industry-wideagreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered bythat agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that wewill renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.     37 Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsIn addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreementsof varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses.  The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses.  We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term andemergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of ourkey management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent. If wefail to retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected. We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including globalfinancial market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content andthe display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local laborlaws and regulations, and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.  Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company throughhis beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.   Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock isreduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on theClass B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A Special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentiallymaterial transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers orconsolidations involving Comcast Corporation, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person orgroup owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock,and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class Bcommon stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.    Comcast 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K 38 Table of Contents"
5,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2014-02-12,">Item 1A: RiskFactors  Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adverselyaffected if we do not compete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changingenvironments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. There also continue to be new entrants with significantfinancial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services, as well as with our cable and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating thecompetitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which is discussed immediately below in Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses. Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all our serviceareas, and phone companies, which overlap approximately 45% of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. We also compete with other providers of traditional cable services. All of these companies typically offerfeatures, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services. Companies that offer services that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of video programming may also compete with our video services. Recently, Googlelaunched high-speed Internet and video services in a limited number of areas, and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to launch these services in more of our services areas. Furthermore, our phone company competitors have their ownwireless facilities and may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network, such as by increasing the speed of our high-speed Internet services, by expanding and enhancing our business servicesto medium-sized businesses and by launching additional services, such as our home security and automation services. We expect these and other initiatives designed to help us compete effectively, such as deploying our X1 platform and wirelessgateways, will require increased capital spending. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future. Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, aswell as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. For example, our cable networks, broadcast television networksand owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations, as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home, such as video games, DVDs and websites. In addition, ourcable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and online digital distributors. Our filmed entertainment business competes with other major studios andother producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production     31 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsof its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters, and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs and with digital distributors for the licensing and sale of its products. It alsocompetes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home.  Ourcable communications business, cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertisingplatforms, such as radio stations, print media and websites. Additionally, our ability to compete depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors andgovernmental authorities.  For a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses, see Business Competition above. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses. We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. New technologies, particularly alternative methods for thedistribution, sale and viewing of content, have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and that drive changes in consumer behavior. These technologies may affectdemand for all of our products and services as the number of entertainment choices available to, and the manner in which they are delivered to, consumers continue to increase and evolve. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emergingtechnologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses.  Newer services and technologies that maycompete with our video services include digital distribution services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers, aswell as other devices such as smartphones and tablets. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content, which could adversely affect demand for our video services, including for premium networks and our DVR, On Demandand streaming services. In addition, consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information, entertainment and communications services anywhere and anytime they want; newer services in wireless Internet technology such as 4G wirelessbroadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice services are facing increasedcompetition from wireless and Internet-based phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effecton our cable communications competitive position, business and results of operations.  New technologies are also affectingconsumer behavior in ways that are changing how content is viewed as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content, which may have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations. For example, the increasedavailability of DVRs, video-on-demand services and cable, broadcast and other video programming on the Internet (including high-quality original video programming that may be viewed only through digital distribution services), as well as increasedaccess to various media through wireless devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets, which could adversely affect the demand for our video services, the price and amount of advertisingthat advertisers are willing to purchase from us, the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to NBCUniversal for its content and the levels of DVD and theatrical sales. These new technologies have increased the number ofentertainment choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. Some of these newer technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or tofast-forward or skip advertisements within programming, which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive. Delayed    Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of Contentsviewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of DVRs has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video-on-demand services and Internetsources. Some of these new technologies are also challenging the existing legal copyright framework that we rely on to protect and monetize our intellectual property rights, as more fully discussed below in Our businesses depend on using andprotecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. These and other changes in technology, distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses.  Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and ourcompetitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, some companies are building costly fiber-optic networks that provide significant high-speed Internet access speeds andwireless Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by ourcompetitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, wemay incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways. We also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer require thatwe offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses. Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our businesses. We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our Cable Communications segments largest single expense item and toincrease in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services or distributeexisting programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms, we incur increased programming expenses. Additionally, we are currently paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their requiredconsent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. If we are unableto raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts withcontent providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses could beadversely affected.  We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may impose additional costsand restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and mayincrease the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP voice service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases may adversely affect, the rights andobligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations, and our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parksbusinesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and the safety ofconsumer products and theme     33 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentspark operations. In addition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment ofcompetitors and other matters. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules,regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on ourbusinesses, which could adversely affect our businesses. For example, in 2010, the FCC adopted open Internet regulations applicable to broadband Internet service providers (ISPs). The regulations required broadband ISPs suchas us to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service (the transparency rule); barred broadband ISPs from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmfuldevices; and barred wireline broadband ISPs such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic. The no-blocking and non-discrimination requirements allowed for reasonable network management. The FCC did not prohibitspeed tiers or usage-based pricing, but specifically noted that paid prioritization (i.e., charging content, application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our last-mile facilities) or an ISPs prioritizing ofits own Internet content likely would violate these regulations. In January 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated all of the FCCs rules except for the transparency rule but the court clarified that the FCC had thefundamental authority to regulate broadband Internet access services as a general matter. Although we remain bound by the FCCs original open Internet regulations as a condition of the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal ConsentDecree for the remainder of the term of those orders, it is possible that the FCC may appeal the courts decision or seek to adopt new Internet regulations or take other actions that restrict the manner in which we and other ISPs provideInternet services. The FCC also may attempt to reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service, which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of theCommunications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates for broadband Internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and Internet content, application, and serviceproviders, including backbone connection arrangements. These arrangements historically have not been regulated by the FCC. The FCC Chairman, however, has stressed that the FCC has a responsibility to ensure connectivity of the Internet,and although he has made clear that he does not consider peering and transit arrangements to be an open Internet issue, he considers it a related issue that the FCC, at a minimum, should monitor. The FCC might also take a broader view ofits existing authority, as confirmed by the court decision, to adopt any regulation that conceivably would promote broadband deployment and adoption so long as it is not a common carrier regulation, and states may also attempt to regulate theInternet pursuant to the courts decision. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of allof our businesses, see Business  Legislation and Regulation above.  Weak economic conditions may have a negativeimpact on our businesses.  A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected byprevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions, or increases in price levels generally due to inflationary pressures, could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results ofoperations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower costcompetitive services, such as Internet video streaming and downloading services, or substitute services, such as mobile phones, smartphones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue ofour cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses. Weak economic conditions could also reduce the fees that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks programming and   Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34 Table of Contentsfor the retransmission of our broadcast television networks and stations content. Weak economic conditions have also in the past reduced, and could continue to reduce, the performance ofour home entertainment releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending in our theme parks business. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties tosatisfy their obligations to us. Further, any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our businesses may be adverselyaffected.  A decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses. Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertisingon a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increased competition for the leisuretime of audiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or by the economy in general, any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors. In addition, advertiserswillingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which some of our cable networks have experienced and may continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurementand could be negatively affected by changes in audience measurement methodologies. For example, newer methods of viewing content (such as delayed viewing on DVRs or viewing content on computers, tablets or smartphones) might not be counted inaudience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Further, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, or other significant adverse newsevents could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty. Reductions in advertising expenditures could adversely affect our businesses. NBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict, and its businesses may be adverselyaffected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.  Most ofNBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on ourability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic andinternational consumer market. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for themepark attractions, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance.  We also obtain a significant portion of ourcontent from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price weare willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Moreover, particularly with respectto long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, the ability to imposesurcharges on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing anddistributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.     35 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsThe loss of NBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of theseagreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect its businesses.  Our cable networks depend on the maintenance ofdistribution agreements with multichannel video providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own theaffiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, eithermust-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right tomandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. In the course of renewing distribution agreementswith multichannel video providers, we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmissionconsent through December 31, 2014. Our ability to continue to receive compensation from distributors as part of our retransmission consent negotiations may be adversely impacted by online entities that stream our broadcast television contentonline without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content onother distribution platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, couldreduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights ofothers.  We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses andother agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringementby third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question orfrom the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain orcontinue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversals businesses, and its success is highlydependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negativelyaffects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. Forexample, there is ongoing litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of, or compensation to, NBC or its affiliates, and the U.S. Supreme Court has granted certiorari tohear the broadcasting industrys challenge to one such entity. If this practice is validated, the fees multichannel video providers are willing to pay for our broadcast television content may be negatively impacted. We also have brought a suitagainst a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR. None of this litigation is final, and the results as to the validity of these practices have been mixed to date. Additionally, there is apending legislative proposal that seems    Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36 Table of Contentsintended to legitimize some of these practices. There can be no assurance as to whether the courts will ultimately invalidate these practices or the pending legislation will be enacted, or howany such rulings or legislation would ultimately affect our businesses.  Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier,and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing ofhigh-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcasttelevision and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technicalprotective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system failsto adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Business Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Property above for additional information. We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure ordestruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.  Network and information systems andother technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, naturaldisasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in largeexpenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidentalrelease or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such securitybreach. We may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses, and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that thisinformation may be compromised. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for anydisruptions to our businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloudservers. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events and security breaches, and we have experienced a few minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significantdegradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance ofthese systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that these events and security breacheswill not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.     37 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations andfinancial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectivelymitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability to provide someservices may be adversely affected.  Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operationsand adversely affect our businesses.  Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical andproduction personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor unionbefore the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us. Moreover, many of NBCUniversals collective bargainingagreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. A labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, andresolution of disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages. In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with varioussports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses. The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses. We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans forkey management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel couldhave a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent. If we fail to retain our on-air orcreative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected. We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including globalfinancial market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content andthe display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local laborlaws and regulations, and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as   Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K 38 Table of Contentsthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If these risks occur, our businesses may be adversely affected. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that werecontemplated at the time of any transaction.  From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategictransactions. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current andnew employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses. Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and ourChairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock. Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject toproportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cablebusiness, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A Special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the Class B commonstock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of ourother shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving Comcast Corporation, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities thatrequire shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stockor securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO,beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock,which could be at a premium.     39 Comcast 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents"
0,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2013-02-21,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do notcompete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number ofcompanies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment and information products and services to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior.Companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of video programming, and wireless services and devices continue to evolve. Moreover, in recent years, Congress and various states haveenacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors. Our ability to compete effectively also is in partdependent on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and governmental authorities.  While competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS operators and phone companies, we also directly compete against other providers of traditional cable services, as well as other companiesthat offer programming and other communications services, including high-speed Internet and phone services, to our customers and potential customers. These companies typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ourcable services. Furthermore, while we began offering Verizon Wirelesss products and services in addition to our cable services in certain of our service areas in 2012, some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilitiesand may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  In addition, our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network, such as by increasing the speed of our high-speed Internet services, by expanding and enhancing ourbusiness services to medium-sized businesses and by launching additional services, such as our home security and automation service. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow ormaintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future.     29 Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsEach of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition fromproviders of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. For example, ourcable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations, as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home, such as videogames, DVDs and websites. More recently, NBCUniversal has begun competing for viewers with digital distribution services, such as Netflix and Amazon, some of which have their own high-quality original content. In addition, our cable networks competewith other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers. Our filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for theproduction of its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs. It also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outsidethe home. Our theme parks business also competes with other multi-park entertainment companies.  In addition, our cable communicationsbusiness, cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such asradio stations, print media and websites.  For a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses, seeBusiness  Competition above. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses. We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. New technologies, particularly alternative methods for thedistribution, sale and viewing of content, have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and that drive changes in consumer behavior. These technologies may affectthe demand for all of our products and services, as the number of entertainment choices available to, and the manner in which they are delivered to, consumers continue to increase and evolve. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt toemerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses.  Newer services and technologiesthat may compete with our video services include digital distribution services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets andcomputers, as well as other devices such as smartphones and tablets. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content, which could adversely affect the demand for our video services, including for premium networks andour DVR, On Demand and streaming services. In addition, consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information, entertainment and communication services outside the home, and newer services in wireless Internet technology, such as 3G and 4Gwireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice services are facingincreased competition from wireless and Internet-based phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have anadverse effect on our cable communications competitive position, business and results of operations.  New technologies also areaffecting consumer behavior in ways that affect how content is viewed as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content, which may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. For example, theincreased availability of DVRs, video-on-demand    Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of Contentsservices and cable, broadcast and other video programming on the Internet (including high-quality original video programming that may be viewed only through digital distribution services), aswell as increased access to various media through wireless devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets, which could adversely affect the demand for our video services, the price andamount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us, the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to NBCUniversal for its content and the levels of DVD and theatrical sales. Some of these newer technologies also giveconsumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within our programming, which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive. Delayed viewing andadvertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of DVRs has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video-on-demand services and Internet sources. These and other changes in technology, distribution platformsand consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses.  Programming expenses for our video services are increasing,which could adversely affect our businesses.  We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our CableCommunications segments largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. Inaddition, as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms, we incur increased programming expenses. We have begun paying certain local broadcasttelevision stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions fromlocal broadcast television stations. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on ourresults of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such contentas part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.  We are subject to regulation by federal, state, localand foreign authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governmentsextensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP voice service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, andin some cases may adversely affect, the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations, and ourcable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which havebecome more stringent over time, and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. In addition, we are subject to the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businessesrelating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules,regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on ourbusinesses, which could adversely affect our businesses. For a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses, see Business  Legislation and Regulation above.     31 Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses. Weak economic conditions in the United States and internationally, including a weak U.S. housing market, persisted during 2012. A substantialportion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. A continued or further decline in economic conditions, or an increase in price levels generally due to inflationarypressures, could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or may discontinuesubscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as Internet video streaming, or substitute services, such as wireless Internet devices andsmartphones. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses. Weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that multichannelvideo providers pay for our cable networks programming and have reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and DVD releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending in our theme parksbusiness. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Further, any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtainfinancing on acceptable terms. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our businesses may be adversely affected. A decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses. Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety ofplatforms, and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increased competition for the leisure time ofaudiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or by the economy in general, any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors. In addition, advertiserswillingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected by changes in audience measurementmethodologies. For example, newer methods of viewing content (such as delayed viewing on DVRs or viewing content on computers, tablets or smartphones) might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue thantraditional distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue. Further, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as aresult of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty. Reductions in advertising expenditures could adversely affect our businesses.  NBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict, and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumeracceptance or our costs to create or acquire content increase.  Most of NBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media andentertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market anddistribute cable networks and broadcast television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. We have invested, and willcontinue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks, in our films and for theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which itwould earn consumer acceptance.    Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of ContentsWe also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios,television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by ourcompetitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Moreover, particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sportsprogramming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size and the timing and amount of our rights payments, and therecan be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannotobtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.  The loss ofNBCUniversals programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect its businesses.  Our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers. Our broadcast television networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements withthird-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect toits retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either must-carry status, in which the distributors carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, orretransmission consent, in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation (if any) paid to thestation by such distributor. In the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations. All of our NBC andTelemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent for the period January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014. Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businessesalso have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of anyof these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcasttelevision and filmed entertainment businesses.  Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies,and our competitors use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, some companies are building fiber-optic networks that provide significant high-speed Internet access speeds andwireless Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective, cost-efficient or attractive to consumers as thatemployed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Moreover, changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and developmentexpenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses.     33 Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and adisruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses. Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations andprogramming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denialof service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of ourservices, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect themfrom similar events in the future. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personneland vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. We may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties inconnection with our businesses, and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against lossesresulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breachescould have a material adverse effect on our businesses. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring hasintensified, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts to cause such systems-related events andsecurity breaches, and we have experienced a few minor systems-related events that, to date, have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations. While we develop andmaintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcomesecurity measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future or not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights ofothers.  We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses andother agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringementby third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question orfrom the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain orcontinue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.    Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34 Table of ContentsIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversalsbusinesses, and our success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content we create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or displayof copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising on our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of protecting ourintellectual property rights. Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and othercontent into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks andother platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lackdeveloped copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights arerepealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, and the value of our intellectual property may be negativelyimpacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase. See Business  Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Property above for additional information. We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations andfinancial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectivelymitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability to provide someservices may be adversely affected.  Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operationsand adversely affect our businesses.  Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical andproduction personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor unionbefore the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us. Moreover, many of NBCUniversals collective bargainingagreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. A labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, andresolution of disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages. In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with varioussports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.     35 Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverseeffect on our businesses.  We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintainlong-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one ormore of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creativetalent. If we fail to retain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our business could beadversely affected.  Sales of DVDs have been declining.  Several factors, including weak economic conditions, the maturation of the standard-definition DVD format, piracy and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time, are contributing to anindustry-wide decline in DVD sales both in the United States and internationally, which has had an adverse effect on our filmed entertainment businesss results of operations. DVD sales have also been adversely affected by an increasing shiftby consumers toward subscription rental, discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment, such as video-on-demand services, which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales. A continued decline in our DVD sales volumes could havean adverse effect primarily on our filmed entertainment business.  We face risks arising from the outcome of various litigationmatters.  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those referred to in Legal Proceedings andthose arising in the ordinary course of business, including regulatory and administrative proceedings, claims and audits. While we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financialcondition, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period, and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be time-consuming, costlyand injure our reputation. Further, no assurance can be given that any unfavorable outcome would not have an adverse effect on our businesses. We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses. We, primarily through NBCUniversal, operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including the current European debt crisis and other global financial marketturmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display andsale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws, andregulations and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign CorruptPractices Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If these risks occur, our businesses may be adversely affected.    Comcast 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36 Table of ContentsAcquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize thefinancial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.  From time to time we make acquisitions andinvestments and enter into other strategic transactions. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquiredbusinesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have an adverse effecton our businesses.

15,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2012-02-23,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do notcompete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number ofcompanies that provide a broad range of entertainment, information and communication products and services to consumers. Moreover, in recent years, Congress and various states have enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies thathave had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors.  Whilecompetition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS operators and phone companies, we also directly compete against other providers of traditional cable services, including SMATV systems and companies that build competing cablesystems in the same communities that we serve, as well as other companies that offer programming and other communications services, including high-speed Internet and phone services, to our customers and potential customers. These companies typicallyoffer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services. Furthermore, we began offering Verizon Wireless products and services in addition to our cable services in certain of our service areas in 2012, some of ourphone company competitors, including Verizon, have their own wireless facilities, which we do not have, and have expanded or may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our business andresults of operations. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape, as companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of movies,television shows and other video program-   Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28 Table of Contentsming, and as wireless services and devices continue to evolve. In addition, we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing cable services, such as by enhancing our video servicesofferings by developing applications for, and providing live television streaming on, devices such as tablets and smartphones, by increasing cross functionality among our services and by expanding our business services to medium-sized businesses.There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow our cable communications business or to compete successfully in the future. Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well asfrom other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. We must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses. For example, our cable and broadcast networks and owned local televisionstations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations, as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home, such as video games, DVDs and websites. More recently, we have begun competing for viewers withservices that provide Internet video streaming and downloading of our competitors content and, in some cases, of the services own high-quality original content. They also compete for the sale of advertising time with other networks andstations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio stations, print media and websites. In addition, our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming bymultichannel video providers. Our filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for the production of its films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space inretail stores for its DVDs and also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home. Our theme parks business also competes with other multi-park entertainmentcompanies. For a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses, see Competition above.  Ourability to compete effectively also is in part dependent on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and governmental authorities. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our competitive position, business and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. New technologies have been, and will likelycontinue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face and that drive changes in consumer behavior. These technologies may affect the demand for all of our products and services, as the number of entertainment choicesavailable to, and the manners in which they are delivered to, consumers continue to increase. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our competitiveposition, business and results of operations.  New services and technologies that may compete with our video services include onlineservices and devices that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers, as well as other devices such as smartphones, tablets andInternet-connected televisions. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content, which could adversely affect the demand for our video services, including for our premium networks, DVR and On Demand services. Inaddition, consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information, entertainment and communication services outside the home, and newer services in wireless Internet technology, such as 3G and 4G wireless broadband services and Wi-Finetworks, and devices such     29 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsas wireless data cards, tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our high-speed Internet services. Our voice services are facing increasedcompetition from wireless and Internet-based phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effecton our cable communications competitive position, business and results of operations.  New technologies also are affectingconsumer behavior in ways that affect how content is viewed, which may have a negative impact on NBCUniversals business and results of operations. For example, the increased availability of video on demand services, DVRs and video programmingon the Internet (including high-quality original video programming that may be viewed only through Internet streaming services), as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of ourcontent through traditional distribution outlets, which could adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us, the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay for our content and thelevels of DVD and theatrical sales. Some of these new technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within our programming, which also mayadversely impact the advertising revenue we receive. Delayed viewing and advertising skipping have the potential to become more common as the penetration of DVRs increases and content becomes increasingly available via video on demand services andInternet sources. These and other changes in technology, distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations. Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our future results of operations. We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our Cable Communications segments largest single expense item in theforeseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services or distribute existingprogramming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms, we incur increased programming expenses. We have recently begun paying certain local television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission ofbroadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for direct monetary compensation and other concessions from local television stations. If we are unable to raise our customersrates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire,there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business and results of operations could beadversely affected.  We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may impose additional costsand restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and mayincrease the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP phone service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases may adversely affect, the rights andobligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations, and our cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parksbusinesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, that have become more stringent over time, and the safety ofconsumer products and theme park operations. In addition, as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, we are subject to the NBCUniversal    Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30 Table of ContentsOrder and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. Failure to comply with the laws andregulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change,existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones, which may significantly affect our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or imposeadditional restrictions on our businesses, which could materially affect our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses, see Business  Legislation andRegulation above.  Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.  Weak economic conditions in the United States and internationally, including a weak U.S. housing market, persisted during2011. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. A continued or further decline in economic conditions, or an increase in price levels generally due toinflationary pressures, could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe, or maydiscontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as video streaming over the Internet, or substitute services, such as wirelessInternet devices and smartphones. The weak economy negatively affected video services during 2011. Weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications, cable networks and broadcasttelevision businesses. Weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks programming and have reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and homeentertainment releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending for our theme parks business. Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy theirobligations to us. Further, any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financialcondition may be adversely affected.  A decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impactour results of operations.  Our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenuefrom the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increasedcompetition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or by the economy in general, any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors. Inaddition, advertisers willingness to purchase advertising may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings for our television programming. Changes in the advertising industry also could adversely affect the advertising revenue of our cableand broadcast networks. For example, we rely on Nielsen ratings and Nielsens audience measurement techniques to measure the popularity of our content. A change in such measurement techniques or the introduction of new techniques couldnegatively impact the advertising revenue we generate. Further, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage andgeneral economic uncertainty. Reductions in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations.     31 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of ContentsNBCUniversals success depends on consumer acceptance of its content, which is difficult topredict, and our results of operations may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or our costs to acquire content increase.  Most of NBCUniversals businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. Thesuccess of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domesticand international consumer market. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content on our cable and broadcast networks and for theme park attractions, before learningthe extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance. In addition, poor theatrical performance of a film may require us to reduce our estimate of revenue from that film, which would accelerate the amortization of capitalized film costs and couldresult in a significant impairment charge. We also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content,particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiringadditional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Moreover, particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number offactors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size and the timing and amount of our rights payments, and there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights, as well as the othercosts of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our results of operations may beadversely affected.  The loss of our programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms,could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.  Our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distributionagreements with multichannel video providers. Our broadcast networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with third-party local television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local television stations.In addition, every three years, each of our owned local television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either must-carry status, pursuant to which the distributorscarriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent, pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the termsand conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the station by such distributor. In the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, we may enter intoretransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local television stations. All of our NBC and Telemundo owned local television stations have elected retransmission consent for the period January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014.Increasingly, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms. There can be no assurance that any ofthese agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce the reach of our television programming and itsattractiveness to advertisers, which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses and results of operations.  Our business depends on keeping pace with technological developments.  Our success is, to alarge extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and the use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide our competitors   Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K 32 Table of Contentswith a competitive advantage. For example, while we are beginning to employ IP technology in certain of our services, some phone companies have been using IP technology to provide video servicesin substantial portions of their service areas, and wireless Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not aseffective, cost-efficient or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, ourbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to ourcustomers or that we make additional research and development expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with ourvendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties couldrequire that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation ofour businesses as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges orclaims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and otherthird parties on reasonable terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, intellectualproperty constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversals businesses, and our success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content we create or acquire against third-party misappropriation,reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising on ourcontent, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of protecting our intellectual property rights. Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, bytechnological advances allowing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and filmsthrough unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. While piracy is a challenge in the UnitedStates, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. Any repeal or weakening of lawsor enforcement in the United States or internationally that is intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights, or a failure of the legal system to adapt to new technologies, could make it more difficult for us to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value or increasing the costs of enforcing our rights. See Business  Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas of Regulation  Intellectual Propertyabove for additional information.  Sales of DVDs have been declining. Several factors, including weak economic conditions, the maturation of the standard-definition DVD format, piracy and intense competition forconsumer discretionary spending and leisure time, are contributing to an     33 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contentsindustry-wide decline in DVD sales both in the United States and internationally, which has had an adverse effect on our filmed entertainment business results of operations. DVD sales havealso been adversely affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental, discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment, such as video on demand services, which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales. Acontinued decline in our DVD sales volumes could have an adverse impact on our filmed entertainment business, as well as on our cable networks and broadcast television businesses. We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure ordestruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our business.  Network and information systems andother technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, naturaldisasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in largeexpenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidentalrelease or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy anysuch security breach. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions toour businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurringhas intensified, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches fromoccurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be noassurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future. Moreover, we may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses, and while we obtain assurancesthat these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised.  We may be unableto obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.  We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significantamount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of ourhardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financialdifficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or theyotherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, in which case our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.    Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34 Table of ContentsLabor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations andadversely affect our business.  Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and productionpersonnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent and cable communications employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before theexpiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us. Moreover, many of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreementsare industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. A labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and resolutionof disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages. In addition, our cable and broadcast networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations tobroadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse impact on our businesses, cash flows and results of operations. We face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those referred to in Legal Proceedings and those arising in theordinary course of business, including regulatory and administrative proceedings, claims and audits. While we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, an adverseoutcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period, and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be time-consuming, costly and injure ourreputation. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition.Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that werecontemplated at the time of any transaction.  From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategictransactions. In 2011, in addition to the NBCUniversal transaction, we entered into agency agreements with Verizon Wireless providing, among other things, for Verizon Wireless sale of our cable services and our sale of Verizon Wirelessproducts and services. We also formed an innovation joint venture with Verizon Wireless and two other cable operators to develop technology to better integrate wireline and wireless products and services. In connection with these and otheracquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors,incur significant indebtedness, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.  The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses.  We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term andemergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of ourkey management personnel could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our on-air and creative talent.

Our operation of businesses worldwide increased substantially as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction. There arerisks inherent in doing business internationally, including the current European debt crisis and other global financial market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationarypressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing,staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments. In addition, doing business internationally is subject to risksrelating to political or social unrest, corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If these risks come to pass, ourbusinesses may be adversely affected.

12,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2011-02-25,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do notcompete effectively.  All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number ofcompanies that provide a broad range of news and entertainment programming and information and communication services to consumers. While competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS operators and phone companies, we also directly compete against otherproviders of traditional cable services, including companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities that we serve and SMATV systems, as well as other companies that offer programming and other communications services, includinghigh-speed Internet and phone services, to our customers and potential customers. Recently, companies have emerged that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming, some of which charge anominal or no fee for access. Phone companies have expanded their service areas in recent years, which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas. Some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless phone facilities, which wedo not have, and have expanded or may expand their cable service offerings to include wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our growth, business and results of operations. In addition, in 2010, DBS operators and phone companies continued toadd features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the cable services we offer. In recent years, Congress and various states have enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies that have hadthe effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors. In addition, while we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing cable products and services, such as by employingaddressable advertising and offering our cable services to business customers, there can be no assurance that we can execute on these enhancements or expansions in a manner sufficient to grow our businesses or compete successfully in the future. Each of NBCUniversals businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from alternative providers of similar types ofcontent, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. We must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating NBCUniversals businesses. For example, our cable programming andbroadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for viewers with other cable networks, broadcast networks and television stations, as well as with other forms of content available in the home, such as video games, DVDs and websites,and they also compete for the sale of advertising time with other cable networks,broad-cast networks and television stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio stations, print media and websites. In addition, our cable programming networks compete withother cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by MVPDs. NBCUniversals filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for the production ofits films, for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its DVDs and also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home. In addition, our ability to compete effectively is in part dependent on our perceived image and reputation among our variousconstituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, investors and governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the future against existing or new competitors or that competition willnot have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  Changes in technology and consumer behavior mayadversely affect our businesses and results of operations.  New technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developedthat further increase the number of competitors we face for our cable services, our cable distribution and programming advertising businesses and NBCUniversals businesses. For example, new services and technologies that may compete with ourvideo services include online services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets, as well as wireless and other emerging mobiletechnologies that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming. Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content, which could adversely affect our cable programming and broadcast businesses. The successof these new services and technologies also could negatively impact the demand for our video services, including for our advanced, premium and On Demand services. Moreover, changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may requirethat we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers. Further, the increasing number of choices available to our customers could adversely affect advertisers willingness to purchase advertisingfrom us. In addition, newer services in wireless Internet technology, such as 3G and 4G wireless broadband services, may compete with our high-speed Internet services, and our phone services are facing increased competition from wireless andInternet-based phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services. The success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.     Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K 24 Table of Contents Moreover, the use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide our competitors with acompetitive advantage. For example, in some cases, phone companies are using IP technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas, and wireless Internet technologies continue to evolve. We expect other advances incommunications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace, to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail toemploy technologies desired by our customers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. New technologies also are affecting consumer behavior in ways that may have a negative impact on revenue for our programming content. For example,the increased availability of DVRs and video programming on the Internet, as well as increased access to various media through mobile devices, have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets. Some ofthese new technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within our programming, which may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive.Delayed viewing and advertising skipping have the potential to become more common as the penetration of DVRs increases and content becomes increasingly available via Internet sources. Changes in technology, distribution platforms and consumerbehavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.  Programming expenses for our video services areincreasing, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.  We expect programming expenses for our video services tocontinue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future. The MVPD industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video servicesor distribute existing programming to more of our customers, we incur increased programming expenses. We also expect to be subject to increasing demands, including demands for cash payments and other concessions, by broadcasters in exchange fortheir required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our customers. If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost ofprogramming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our programming contracts and retransmission consents with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable termsor that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video servicesand our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  As aresult of the NBCUniversal transaction, our businesses are subject to the conditions set forth in the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses and results of operations.  In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversalConsent Decree incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by the parties and imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters. Among other things, (i) we are requiredto make certain of our cable, broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions, and they may invoke commercial arbitration to determine what programming must be made available and the price,terms and conditions that apply; (ii) multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration to determine the price, terms and conditions for access to our broadcast stations, cable networks and regional sports networks; (iii) weare prohibited from discriminating against cable programming networks on the basis of their non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for carriage, under a standard that is comparable to existing law; (iv) we must comply with theFCCs open Internet rules regardless of whether these rules are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded, and those rules will apply to any set-top box we provide that enables a customer to receive high-speed Internet services; (v) wemust satisfy various other conditions relating to our high-speed Internet services, including deploying broadband to certain unserved areas, implementing a program to improve high-speed Internet adoption among lower-income households, offering allour customers a stand-alone high-speed Internet service, and maintaining a high-speed Internet service of at least 12 megabits per second across most of our footprint; and (vi) we must renew our distribution agreement with Hulu ifthe two other broadcast network owners of Hulu also renew their agreements, and we must relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in Hulu. These and other conditions and commitments relating to the NBCUniversal transaction are of varyingduration, ranging from three to seven years. Although we cannot predict how the conditions will be administered or what effects they will have on our businesses, we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business or results ofoperations. There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be any legal challenges to the NBCUniversal Consent Decree.  Weare subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP digital phone service industries. We expect that     25 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some cases adversely affect, the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entitiesunder the Communications Act and other laws.  In addition, local franchising authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operateour cable systems. We have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time. Local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition of renewal or transfer, and these concessions or other commitmentscould be costly to us. In addition, we could be disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors, such as if phone companies that provide video services are not subject to the local franchisingrequirements and other requirements that apply to us. For example, the FCC has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants. See Legislation andRegulation  Cable Services  Video Services  Franchising above for additional information.  The televisionbroadcasting and content distribution industries in the United States also are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations. For example, NBCUniversals owned local television stations may be adversely affected by recent proposals toreallocate spectrum for broadband capability that is currently available for television broadcasters. As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, our businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal,state and local levels, including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, which have become more stringent over time, and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations, which may have an adverse effect on ourbusinesses and results of operations.  Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result inadministrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, Congress is constantly considering new legislative requirements, as are various regulatory agencies such as the FCC, which could potentially affect ourbusinesses. Any future legislative, judicial or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, which could materially affect our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the risksassociated with the regulation of all of our businesses, see Legislation and Regulation above.  Weak economic conditionsmay have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Weak economic conditions, including a weak housingmarket, persisted during 2010. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. To the extent these weak economic conditions continue, customers may reduce theadvanced or premium services to which they subscribe, or maydiscontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as video streaming over theInternet, or substitute services, such as wireless phones. The weak economy negatively affected our net cable services customer additions during 2010. Moreover, weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of ourcable and programming businesses. Weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that MVPDs pay for our cable television programming and has reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releasesand attendance and spending for our theme parks business. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. A decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our results of operations. Our cable distribution, cable programming and broadcast businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety ofplatforms, and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, by increased competition for the leisure time ofaudiences and audience fragmentation, by the growing use of new technologies, or by the economy in general, causing advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors. In addition, advertisers willingness topurchase advertising may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings for our television programming. Changes in the advertising industry also could adversely affect the advertising revenue of our cable programming and broadcast networks. Forexample, we rely on Nielsen ratings and Nielsens audience measurement techniques to measure the popularity of our content. A change in such measurement techniques or the introduction of new techniques could negatively impact the advertisingrevenue we receive. Further, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty.Reductions in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations.  NBCUniversals success depends onconsumer acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict, and our results of operations may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or our costs to acquire content increase. Most of NBCUniversals businesses create media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes andpreferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and    Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26 Table of Contents other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market. NBCUniversal historically has invested substantial amounts in its content, including inthe production of original content, before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance. We intend to continue to invest significantly in this area. In addition, we obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties,such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors forpopular content. Renewing our contract rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content onacceptable terms, or at all, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, poor theatrical performance of a film may require us to reduce our estimate of revenue from that film, which would accelerate the amortization ofcapitalized film costs and could result in a significant write-off, and may adversely affect multiple reporting periods.  The loss ofour programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our business.  Our cable programming networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers. Our broadcast networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements withthird-party local television stations in the markets where we do not own our local television stations. In addition, every three years, each of our owned local television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel videoproviders within its DMA, either must-carry status, pursuant to which the distributors carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or retransmission consent,pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the station by such distributor.In the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers, we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local television stations. All of our NBC affiliated owned local television stations haveelected the retransmission consent option, while our owned Telemundo affiliated stations have elected must-carry or retransmission consent depending on circumstances. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing agreements will be renewed inthe future on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of any of these agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers, which in turncould adversely affect our business. Sales of DVDs have been declining. Several factors, including weak economic conditions, the maturation of the standard-definition DVD format, piracy and intense competition forconsumer discretionary spending and leisure time, are contributing to an industry-wide decline in DVD sales both in the United States and internationally, which has had an adverse effect on NBCUniversals results of operations. DVD sales havealso been adversely affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental, discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment, such as on-demand services, which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales. Media andentertainment industries face a challenge in managing the transition from physical to electronic formats in a manner that generates sufficient revenue to maintain historical profits and growth. There can be no assurance that DVD wholesale prices andsales volumes can be maintained at current levels due to aggressive retail pricing and the consumer transition to digital and lower-priced rental services.  We rely on network and information systems and other technology, as well as key properties, and a disruption, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technology or properties may disrupt our business. Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer serviceoperations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns,denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruptionof our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties, equipment and data. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protectthem from similar events in the future. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to ourbusinesses that may result. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks, including customer,personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. The occurrence of any such network or information systems-related events or security breachescould have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.     27 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents  We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Moreover, some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor theoperations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we couldeffectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability toprovide some services may be materially adversely affected, in which case our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties,to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royaltyor licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currentlyconducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they canbe time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms,our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, NBCUniversals intellectual property constitutesa significant part of its value, and the success of its businesses is highly dependent on protecting its intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. Theunauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising on our content, and increases our costsdue to our active enforcement of protecting our intellectual property rights. Piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advancesallow-ing the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular,piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on DVDs, peer-to-peer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable programming and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses. Whilepiracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the UnitedStates. Any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally that are intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights, or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies, could make itmore difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value or increasing the costs of enforcing our rights. See Legislation and Regulation  Other Areas  Intellectual Property andPiracy above for additional information.  Labor disputes, whether involving our own employees or sports leagues, may disruptour operations and adversely affect our business.  Many of NBCUniversals employees, including writers, directors, actors,technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of acollective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us. Moreover, many of NBCUniversals collective bargaining agreements areindustry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. A labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and resolution ofdisputes may increase our costs. For example, a Writers Guild of America strike in 2007-2008 disrupted NBCUniversals ability to produce scripted television programming, causing viewership levels and ratings to decline, which resulted in lowerU.S. advertising revenue for the NBC Network. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages. In addition, our cable programming networks, our regional sports networks, and our broadcast networks have programming rights agreements of varyingscope and duration with various sports leagues and associations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Labor disputes in these and other sports leagues orassociations could have an adverse impact on our businesses, revenue and results of operations. The current collective bargaining agreement with both the NFL and the NBA players union expire at the end of their respective 2010-2011   Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28 Table of Contents  seasons. collective bargaining agreement with the NBAs players union expires following the end of the 2010-2011 season. Our programming rights agreement with the NFL requires us tomake significant payments to the NFL, and, at the NFLs option, we may be required to make these payments even if the NFL does not play all or part of a season during the term of our agreement because of a player strike or lockout. In theabsence of a timely agreement, protracted negotiations could result in a player strike or lockout, in which case the number of NFL games that we broadcast, and our revenue from those broadcasts, may be reduced. Although the NFL would be required tocredit or refund the rights fee attributable to the lost games to us (in addition to paying interest and out-of-pocket production costs) if all or part of an NFL season is canceled, it would have the right to apportion the credit or refundthroughout the remaining term of our agreement, potentially all in the final year of the term. The timing of such payments and refunds could have an impact on our cash flows during the relevant period. In addition, any labor disputes that occur inany sports league or association for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those referred to in Legal Proceedings and those arising in theordinary course of business, including regulatory and administrative proceedings, claims and audits. While we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, an adverseoutcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period, and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be time-consuming, costly and injure ourreputation. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition.Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that werecontemplated at the time of any transaction, including the NBCUniversal transaction.  From time to time we make acquisitions andinvestments and enter into other strategic transactions. In connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquiredbusinesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant indebtedness, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.In particular, the NBCUniversal transaction involves the integration of the Comcast Content Businesswith NBCUniversals businesses, as well as the integration of NBCUniversals businesses with our cable distribution and other businesses. We, as well as NBCUniversal, will be required to devote significant management attention andresources to continue integrating these businesses. Challenges involved in the integration include successfully integrating each companys operations, technologies and content, and combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale andretaining key employees. There can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate these businesses or succeed in the highly competitive media industry. Moreover, there can be no assurance that NBCUniversal will be able to generate strong cashflows or favorable financial returns.  The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have anegative impact on our business. We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While wemaintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the lossof one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, NBCUniversals businesses depend on the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its on-air and creative talent. If we fail toretain our on-air or creative talent, if the costs to retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals lose their current appeal, our business could be adversely affected. We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business. Our operation of businesses worldwide increased substantially as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction. There are risks inherent in doingbusiness internationally, including economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution ofcontent and the display and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations, issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverselocal labor laws and regulations, potentially adverse tax developments, political or social unrest, corruption and risks related to government regulation. If these risks come to pass, our business may be adversely affected.    29 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over severalpotentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our operations through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock.

10,CMCSA,COMCAST CORP,2010-02-23,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
  Our cable services currently face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations.  We operate in intensely competitive industries. We compete with a number of companies that provide a broad range of news and entertainment programmingand information and communication services to consumers. While competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS operators and phone companies, we also directly compete against other providers of cable services, includingcompanies that build competing cable systems in the same communities that we serve, satellite master antenna television systems and other companies that offer programming and other communications services, including high-speed Internet and phoneservices, to our customers and potential customers. In 2009, phone companies continued to expand their service areas, which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and our primary competitors continued to add features and adoptaggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer. Moreover, in recent years, Congress and various states have enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted  13 Comcast 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors. See Legislation and Regulationin Item 1 for additional information. In addition, while we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing products and services, such as by employing addressable advertising and offering commercial services, there can be no assurancethat we can execute on these enhancements or expansions in a manner sufficient to compete successfully in the future. Also, our ability to compete effectively is in part dependent upon our perceived image and reputation among our variousconstituencies, including our customers, investors and governmental authorities. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively. Technological advances have increased and will likely continue to increase competition for our cable services, which could adversely affect our future results of operations. We operate in a technologically complex environment where the use of certain types of technology may provide our competitors with a competitiveadvantage. For example, cable operators may employ different technologies in their efforts to recapture bandwidth to allow for more HDTV programming and On Demand services, faster Internet speeds and other services for customers. Also, in somecases, phone companies are using IP technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas. We expect other advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace, to occur in the future. If wechoose technology that is not as effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by our customers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectivelyon our technology initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Moreover, new technologies havebeen, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face for our video, high-speed Internet and phone services and our advertising business. For example, new services and technologies that may competewith our video services include online services that offer Internet video streaming, downloading and distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, and wireless and other emerging mobile technologies that provide for thedistribution and viewing of video programming. Newer services in wireless Internet technology, such as third and fourth generation wireless broadband services, may compete with our high-speed Internet services, and our phone services are facingincreased competition from wireless phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with wireless phone service. Moreover, some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities, which we donot have, and have expanded or may expand their cable service bundle offerings to include wireless offerings, which may adversely affect our growth, business and results of operations. The success ofany of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Programming expenses are increasing, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.  We expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video programming distribution industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming,especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers, we incur increased programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers rates oroffset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our programming contracts with programming providersexpire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services and our business and results of operationsmay be adversely affected.  We also expect to be subject to increasing demands, including demands for cash payments and otherconcessions, by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our customers. We cannot predict the magnitude of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we concede tocertain of these demands or fail to obtain the required consents. We are subject to regulation by federal, state and localgovernments, which may impose additional costs and restrictions.  Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the videoservices industry and may increase the regulation of the Internet service and VoIP digital phone service industries. We expect that legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify, and in some casesadversely affect, the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws. Congress is constantly considering new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses. The results ofthese legislative, judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business and results of operations.  In addition, localfranchising authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems. We have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time. Local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a conditionof renewal or transfer, and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to us. In addition, we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors, such as if phonecompanies that provide video services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us. Comcast 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K 14 Table of Contents For example, the FCC has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants. See Legislation andRegulation in Item 1 and refer to the Franchising discussion within that section.  We also face other risksrelated to federal, state and local regulations. For example, Congress and the FCC are also considering various forms of net neutrality regulation. See Legislation and Regulation in Item 1 and refer to theHigh-Speed Internet Services discussion within that section. For a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with our regulation by federal, state and local governments, see Legislation and Regulation inItem 1.  Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Weak economic conditions persisted during 2009, and a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whosespending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. To the extent these weak economic conditions continue, customers may reduce the advanced or premium services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or moreof our cable services. This risk may be worsened by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as video streaming over the Internet, or substitute services, such as wireless phones. The weak economy negativelyaffected our net customer additions during 2009 and also had a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our Cable and Programming segments. If these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate, our business, results of operations andfinancial condition may be adversely affected.  We rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption orfailure of such networks, systems or technology may disrupt our business.  Network and information systems and other technologies,including those related to our network management and customer service operations, are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructiveor disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events,could result in a degradation or disruption of our cable services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment and data. These network and information systems-related events also could result in large expenditures to repair orreplace the damaged networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of informationmaintained in our information technology systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capitaland other resources to remedy any such security breach. The occurrence of any such network or information systems-related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness and results of operations. We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support. We depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to providecertain of our services. Moreover, some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor theoperations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we couldeffectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications, our ability toprovide some services may be materially adversely affected, in which case, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.  We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our productsand services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetaryliability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit ourability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert managements attentionand resources away from our business. Moreover, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third partieson reasonable terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We face risks arising from the outcome ofvarious litigation matters.  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those referred to in LegalProceedings in Item 3 and those arising in the ordinary course of business, including regulatory and administrative proceedings, claims and audits. While we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will  15 Comcast 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-KTable of Contents have a material effect on our financial condition, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any oneperiod, and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be time-consuming, costly and injure our reputation. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition.Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that werecontemplated at the time of any transaction.  From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategictransactions. In connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current andnew employees, customers and vendors, incur significant indebtedness, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, cash flows and financial condition.  In addition, in connection with our proposed NBC Universal transaction with GE, wecannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory and governmental approvals to consummate the transaction on acceptable terms or predict whether any conditions that may be imposed on our businesses in permitting thetransaction to occur would have an adverse effect on our businesses. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete a committed financing of NBC Universal on currently contemplated terms, including that the new companywill receive an investment grade credit rating from the debt rating agencies. Moreover, assuming the NBC Universal transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate our programming assets with those of NBCUniversal, create popular programming, develop new digital products and services or succeed in the highly competitive media industry.  Also, as noted in more detail in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we are required to pay to GE at the closing of this transaction $7.1 billion in cash, lesscertain adjustments primarily based on the free cash flow generated by NBC Universal between December 4, 2009 and the closing, and we have committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or common stock for each of two potential redemptions byGE (for an aggregate of up to $5.75 billion, with amounts not used for the first redemption to be available for the second redemption) to the extent the new company cannot fund the redemptions. There can be no assurance that the new company will beable to generate strong cash flows or attractive financial returns.   The loss of key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business.We rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans forkey management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel couldhave a negative impact on our business. Our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights overseveral potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our operations through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock. Our Class B common stock has a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This nondilutable voting power is subject toproportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.s cablebusiness, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A Special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the Class B commonstock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other stockholders and even if they might be in the best interests of ourother stockholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving Comcast Corporation, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities thatrequire shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stockor securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock.  Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influenceover our operations and the ability (subject to certain restrictions through November 17, 2012) to transfer potential effective control by selling the Class B common stock. In addition, under our articles of incorporation,Mr. Roberts is entitled to remain as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President until May 26, 2010, unless he is removed by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the entire Board of Directors or he is no longer willing or ableto serve.  Comcast 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K 16 Table of Contents "

BUSINESS    We are thelargest broadband cable provider in the United States and offer a wide variety of consumer entertainment and communication products and services, serving more than 21 million video subscribers, 8 million high-speed Internet subscribers and1 million phone subscribers. We were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania in December 2001. Through our predecessors (including our immediate predecessor Comcast Holdings), we have developed, managed and operated broadband cable systemssince 1963.    We manage our operations through two reportablesegments, Cable and Content. The Cable segment generates approximately 95% of our consolidated revenues.    Our Cable segment develops, manages and operates our broadband cable systems, including video, high-speed Internet and phone services (cableservices).    Our Content segment includes our six nationalcable networks: E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, The Golf Channel, OLN, G4 and AZN Television (formerly known as the International Channel).    Our other business interests include Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers, the Philadelphia 76ers and two large multipurpose arenas inPhiladelphia, and manages other facilities for sporting events, concerts and other events. Comcast Spectacor and all other businesses not included in our Cable or Content segment are included in Corporate and Other activities.   For financial and other information on our segments, refer toNote 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is filed as Exhibit 13.1 to, and portions of which are incorporated by reference in, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND WEBSITES    Our telephone number is (215) 665-1700 and our principal executiveoffices are located at 1500 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102-2148.

The information posted on our website is not incorporated into our SEC filings. Table of ContentsGENERAL DEVELOPMENTS OF OUR BUSINESSES    We operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive, highly regulatedand technologically complex environment. During 2005, we continued to focus on our strategy of differentiating our products and services. Our cable business launched a new Internet-Protocol (IP)-enabled phone service (Comcast DigitalVoice) in 25 markets, accelerated the deployment of Video On Demand (VOD) and our advanced services (including digital video recorders (DVR) and high-definition television (HDTV)), launched a new interactiveprogramming guide for our digital cable services, and invested in our infrastructure systems to accelerate the convergence of our products and services. Our content business expanded its ownership and management of content businesses on a national,regional and local level.    The following are the moresignificant strategic transactions (and potential transactions) since the beginning of 2005:     In March 2005, we entered into two joint ventures with Motorola under which we are developing and licensing next-generation programming access security (known asconditional access) technology for cable systems and related products. One of the ventures will license such products to equipment manufacturers and other cable companies. The other venture will provide us greater participation in thedesign and development of conditional access technology for our cable systems. These ventures increase our ability to work with additional equipment vendors.     In April 2005, we completed a transaction with a group of investors to acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (MGM). We acquired our 20% interest for approximately$250 million in cash. This transaction contemplates the inclusion of Sony Pictures and MGM programming in our VOD service.     In April 2005, we entered into agreements with Time Warner to: (i) jointly acquire substantially all the assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation; (ii) redeem ourinterest in Time Warner Cable and its subsidiary, Time Warner Entertainment; and (iii) exchange certain cable systems with Time Warner Cable. As a result of these transactions, on a net basis, our cash investment is expected to be $1.5 billionand we expect to gain approximately 1.7 million video subscribers.     In August 2005, we acquired the rights to broadcast National Hockey League games on OLN for the next two years, with options to televise additional seasons. OLNs coverage ofNHL games began in October 2005, with some hockey programming also available on VOD and our high-speed Internet service.     In September 2005, we, together with a group of investors, launched PBS KIDS Sprout, a new 24/7 cable network designed for preschoolers. Some of Sprouts programming is alsoavailable on VOD and our high-speed Internet service.     In October 2005, we entered into an agreement with Susquehanna Communications, an organization in which we own an approximate 30% interest, to acquire Susquehannas cablesystems for approximately $775 million. As a result of this transaction, we expect to add approximately 225,000 video subscribers.     In November 2005, we entered into a joint venture with Sprint Nextel Corporation (Sprint), Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Advance/Newhouse Communications todevelop communication and entertainment products that combine our cable products and interactive features with wireless technology.   2 Table of ContentsDESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES    Cable Segment    The table below summarizes certain information for our cable operations as of December 31 (homes and subscribers in millions):      2005  2004  2003  2002(1)  2001  Cable                 Homes Passed(2)   41.6  40.8  39.8  39.2  13.9  Subscribers(3)   21.4  21.5  21.5  21.3  8.5  Penetration  51.5% 52.8% 53.9% 54.4% 60.8% Digital Cable                 Digital Ready Subscribers(4)   21.4  21.5  21.5  21.3  8.4  Subscribers(5)   9.8  8.7  7.7  6.6  1.7  Penetration  45.6% 40.2% 35.7% 31.1% 20.8% High-Speed Internet                 Available Homes(6)   41.2  40.0  34.7  30.1  10.4  Subscribers  8.5  7.0  5.3  3.6  0.9  Penetration  20.7% 17.5% 15.2% 12.0% 9.1% Phone(7)                  Available Homes(6)   21.4  10.4  9.4  8.7     Subscribers  1.3  1.2  1.3  1.4     Penetration  6.2% 11.7% 13.5% 16.5%   (1)On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&Ts broadbandbusiness, which we refer to as Broadband and the Broadband acquisition. The Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations, and direct comparisons of our cable information for periods prior toNovember 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. (2)A home is passed if we can connect it to our distribution system without furtherextending the transmission lines. As described in Note 3 below, in the case of certain multiple dwelling units (MDUs), such as apartment buildings and condominium complexes, homes passed are counted on an adjustedbasis. Homes passed is an estimate based on the best available information. (3)Generally, a dwelling or commercial unit with one or more television sets connected to asystem counts as one cable subscriber. In the case of some MDUs, we count homes passed and cable subscribers on an Federal Communications Commission (FCC) equivalent basis by dividing total revenue received from a contract with an MDU bythe standard residential rate where the specific MDU is located. (4)A subscriber is digital ready if the subscriber is in a market where we havelaunched our digital cable service. (5)A dwelling with one or more digital set-top boxes counts as one digital cable subscriber. Onaverage, as of December 31, 2005, each digital cable subscriber had 1.5 digital set-top boxes. (6)A home passed is available if we can connect it to our distribution systemwithout further upgrading the transmission lines and if we offer the service in that area. Available homes include circuit-switched and Comcast Digital Voice homes. (7)Prior to the Broadband acquisition, the number of phone available homes andsubscribers was not material.    Cable Services   We offer a variety of services over our broadbandcable systems, including video, high-speed Internet and phone. Over the past several years, we have increased the reliability and capacity of our systems, enabling us to deliver new services, such as digital cable, high-speed Internet and IP-enabledphone.    With our broadband cable system upgrade complete, weare now focusing our capital and technology investments on extending the reach and capacity of our networks, improving network efficiency, increasing the   3 Table of Contentscapacity and cost structure of advanced set-top boxes, developing the features and functionality of interactive services such as gaming, polling andshopping, and integrating wireless phone features with advanced set-top boxes and our high-speed Internet service.    Video Services    We offer a full range of video services. We tailor our channel offerings for each system serving a particular geographic area according to applicablelocal and federal regulatory requirements, programming preferences and demographics. Subscribers typically pay us on a monthly basis and generally may discontinue services at any time. Monthly subscription rates and related charges vary according tothe type of service selected and the type of equipment the subscriber uses. Our video service offerings include the following:    Basic cable. Our basic cable service consists of a limited basic service with access to between 10 and 20 channels of programming and anexpanded basic service with access to between 60 and 80 channels of programming. These services generally consist of programming provided by national and local broadcast networks, national and regional cable networks, and governmental and publicaccess programming.    Digital cable. Our digital cableservice consists of an enhanced cable service and a full digital cable service. Enhanced cable service uses a digital set-top box to deliver between 60 and 80 channels of video programming, multiple music channels, an interactive program guide, anda limited VOD library. Full digital cable service also uses a digital set-top box to deliver over 200 channels of video programming, multiple music channels, an interactive program guide, access to a full VOD library, and multiple versions (variedas to time of broadcast or programming content theme) of any premium channel programming purchased by the subscriber.    Video On Demand. Our VOD service, which we refer to as Comcast On Demand, allows our enhanced cable and digital cable subscribers the opportunityto choose from a library of programs, start the programs at whatever time is convenient, and pause, rewind or fast-forward the programs. A substantial portion of our VOD content is available to our digital cable subscribers at no additional charge.   High-Definition Television. Our advanced HDTV serviceprovides our digital subscribers with improved, high-resolution picture quality, improved audio quality and a wide-screen, theater-like display. Our HDTV service offers a broad selection of high-definition programming with access to between 10 and18 high-definition channels including most major broadcast networks, leading national cable networks, premium channels and regional sports networks.    Digital Video Recorder. Our advanced DVR service lets digital cable subscribers select, record and store programs and play them at whatever time isconvenient. DVR service also provides the ability to pause and rewind live television.    Premium channel programming. Our premium channel programming service, which includes cable networks such as Home Box Office (HBO),Showtime, Starz and Cinemax, generally offers, without commercial interruption, feature motion pictures, live and taped sporting events, concerts and other special features.    Pay-per-view programming. Our pay-per-view service permits our cable subscribers to order, for a separate fee,individual feature motion pictures and special event programs, such as professional boxing, professional wrestling and concerts, on an unedited, commercial-free basis.    High-Speed Internet Services    We offer high-speed Internet access that is constantly connected, with downstream speeds generally from 6Mbps to 8Mbps depending on the service selected.This service also includes our interactive portal, Comcast.net, which provides multiple e-mail addresses, online storage and a variety of proprietary content, and   4 Table of Contentsvalue-added features and enhancements, designed to take advantage of the speed of the Internet connection we provide.    Phone Services    We offer Comcast Digital Voice, our IP-enabled phone service that provides unlimited local and domestic long distancecalling, including features such as Voice Mail, Caller ID and Call Waiting. As of December 31, 2005, Comcast Digital Voice service was available to 16 million homes in 25 markets. We expect that by the end of 2006 approximately 27 millionhomes will have access to Comcast Digital Voice.    In someareas, we offer our circuit-switched local phone service. Substantially all this business was obtained in the Broadband acquisition. Subscribers to this service have access to a full array of calling features and third-party long-distance services.   Advertising    As part of our programming license agreements with cable networks, we oftenreceive an allocation of scheduled advertising time which we may sell to local, regional and national advertisers.    We also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets. We have also formed and operate or participate in advertisinginterconnects, which establish a physical, direct link among multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator.    Regional Sports and News Networks    Our regional sports and news networks include Comcast SportsNet(Philadelphia), Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic (Baltimore/Washington), Cable Sports Southeast, CN8The Comcast Network, Comcast SportsNet Chicago and Comcast SportsNet West (Sacramento). These networks earn revenue through the sale ofadvertising time and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators and satellite television companies.    Other Revenue Sources    We also generate revenues from installation services, commissions from third-party electronic retailing and from other services, such as providingbusinesses with Internet connectivity and networked business applications.    Programming    We license from cablenetworks the programming we offer to our video subscribers, generally on a multi-year basis, and for which we generally pay a monthly fee on a per video subscriber, per channel, basis. We attempt to secure long-term licenses with volume discountsand/or marketing support and incentives.    Our programming costsare increased by the growth in the number of video subscribers, the increase in the number of channels we provide and increases in license fees. We expect our programming costs to continue to be our largest single expense item, and to increase, inthe future. In recent years, the cable and satellite television industries have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of programming, particularly sports programming. We anticipate that these increases may be mitigated, to some extent, byvolume discounts.    Customer and Technical Service    We service our customers through local, regional and national call andtechnical centers. Generally, our call centers provide 24/7 call answering capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services function   5 Table of Contentsperforms various tasks, including installations, transmission and distribution plant maintenance, plant upgrades and activities related to customer service.   Technology Development    Historically, we have relied on third-party hardware and software vendorsfor many of the technologies needed for the operation of our businesses, the addition of new features to existing services and the development and commercialization of new service offerings. In recent years, we have begun developing strategicallyimportant software and technologies internally and integrating third-party software to our specifications. We have also now arranged for long-term access rights to national fiber-based networks that we actively manage to interconnect our local andregional distribution systems and facilitate the efficient delivery of our broadband services. We expect these efforts to continue and expand in the future. These efforts require greater initial expenditures than would be required if we continued topurchase or license these products and services from third parties.    Sales and Marketing    Our sales effortsare primarily directed toward generating incremental revenues and increasing the number of subscribers we serve. We offer our products and services through direct customer contact through our call centers, door-to-door selling, direct mailadvertising, cable television advertising, local media advertising, telemarketing and retail outlets.    Competition    Weoperate our businesses in an increasingly competitive environment. Our broadband cable systems compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means. In addition, we operate in atechnologically complex environment and new technologies may further increase the number of competitors we face for our video, high-speed Internet and phone services, and advertising. We expect advances in communications technology to continue inthe future. We are unable to predict what effects, if any, such future developments will have on our businesses and operations.    Video Services    We compete with a number of different sources that provide news, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:     program distributors that use direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, systems that transmit satellite signals containing video programming, data and other information to receivingdishes of varying sizes located on the subscribers premises,     incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) are building wireline fiber-optic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas (and havebegun to offer this service in limited areas), in addition to marketing DBS service in certain areas,     other wireline communications providers who build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cableoperators or under an alternative regulatory scheme known as Open Video Systems, or OVS,     online services, including Internet video streaming and distribution of television shows (and portions thereof) and movies,     satellite master antenna television systems, commonly known as SMATVs, that generally serve condominiums, apartment and office complexes, and residential developments,    local television broadcast stations that provide free over-the-air programming which can be received using an antenna and a television set,   6 Table of Contents  digital subscription services transmitted over local television broadcast stations that can be received by a special set-top box,     video stores and home video products,     movie theaters,     newspapers, magazines and bookstores,     live concerts and sporting events, and     wireless and other emerging technologies in the areas of distributing and viewing video programming.    In recent years, Congress has enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide afavorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems. The FCC adopted rules favoring new investment by ILECs in fiber-optic networks capable of distributing video programming and rulesallocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings. Furthermore, Congress, the FCC and various state governments are considering measures that would reduce or eliminate local franchisingrequirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace, including the ILECs. The State of Texas has enacted legislation to provide a statewide franchise to new entrants, thus eliminating the requirement that such entrants obtainfranchises from individual local franchising authorities. In order to compete effectively, we strive to provide, at a reasonable price to subscribers, new products and services, superior technical performance and customer service, and a greatervariety of video programming.    DBS Systems.According to recent government and industry reports, conventional, medium- and high-power satellites currently provide video programming to over 27 million subscribers in the United States. DBS providers with high-power satellites typicallyoffer more than 300 channels of programming, including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide. Two companies, DIRECTV and EchoStar, provide service to substantially all of these DBS subscribers.    High-power DBS service can be received throughout the continental UnitedStates through small rooftop or side-mounted outside antennas. DBS systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers. Ourdigital cable service is competitive with the programming, channel capacity and quality of signals delivered to subscribers by DBS systems.    Federal legislation establishes, among other things, a compulsory copyright license that permits DBS systems to retransmit local broadcast televisionsignals to subscribers who reside in the local television stations market. These companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we serve. Additionally, federal law generally provides DBS systems with accessto all cable-affiliated video programming services delivered by satellite. As a result, DBS providers are competitive with cable system operators like us because they offer programming that closely resembles what we offer. These DBS providers areattempting to expand their service offerings to include, among other things, high-speed Internet service, and have entered into marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by ILECs.    ILECs. ILECs, in particular AT&T and Verizon, are buildingfiber-optic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas (and have begun to offer this service in limited areas), in addition to entering into joint marketing arrangements with DBS providers in certain areas. TheILECs, have taken various positions on the question of whether they need a local cable television franchise to provide video services, including applying for local franchises, seeking state-level regulation only, and claiming that video services canbe provided without a cable television franchise.    OtherWireline Providers. We operate our cable systems pursuant to non-exclusive franchises that are issued by a local community governing body, such as a city council or county board of supervisors or, in some   7 Table of Contentscases, by a state regulatory agency. Federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises, and itpermits franchising authorities to operate cable systems. Various companies, including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources (such as public utilities, including those that own some of thepoles to which our cables are attached), have obtained cable franchises and provide competing communications services. These and other wireline communications systems offer video and other communications services in various areas where we holdfranchises. We anticipate that facilities-based competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve.    SMATV. Our cable systems also compete for subscribers with SMATV systems. SMATV system operators typically are not subject to regulationlike local franchised cable system operators. SMATV systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and many of the cable networks offered by our cable systems. In addition, some SMATV operators are offering packagesof phone, data and video services to residential and commercial developments. SMATV system operators often enter into exclusive service agreements with building owners or homeowners associations, although some states have enacted laws toprovide cable systems access to MDUs.    BroadcastSubscription Services. Local television broadcasters in selected markets sell digital subscription services. These services typically contain a limited number of cable programming services at a price of approximately $20 per month. Severalleading television broadcast station ownership groups have announced that they are providing funding for U.S. Digital Television, Inc., an entity that currently offers these digital subscription services in several markets as a low costalternative to cable television service. Many other broadcasters are considering similar plans.    High-Speed Internet Services    Substantially all of our cable systems offer high-speed Internet service within their service areas. These systems compete with a number of other companies, many of whom have substantial resources, including:     ILECs and other telephone companies,     Internet service providers (ISPs), such as America Online, Earthlink and Microsoft,     wireless telephone companies and other providers of wireless Internet services, and     power companies.    The deployment of digital subscriber line (DSL), technology allows Internet access to be provided to subscribers over telephone lines at datatransmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional modems. The ILECs and other companies offer DSL service, and several of them have increased transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled service packages. In addition,some ILECs are constructing fiber-optic networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with DSL technology. The FCC has reduced the obligations of ILECs to offer their broadband facilities on awholesale or retail basis to competitors, and it has freed their DSL services of common carrier regulation.    Various wireless telephone companies are offering wireless high-speed Internet services. In addition, in a growing number of commercial areas, such asretail malls, restaurants and airports, wireless WiFi Internet access capability is available. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly-subsidized WiFi Internet access networks. The availability ofthese alternatives may adversely affect demand for our high-speed Internet services.    A number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated ISPs access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements. We reached access agreements with several national and regionalthird-party ISPs, although to date these ISPs have made limited use of their rights. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that regulatory authorities will not impose so-called open access or similar   8 Table of Contentsrequirements on us as part of an industry-wide requirement. These requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.    We expect competition for high-speed Internet service subscribers to remainintense, with companies competing on service availability, price, transmission speed and bundled services.    Phone Services    Ourcircuit-switched local phone service and Comcast Digital Voice service compete against ILECs, wireless telephone service providers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) and other Voice-over-IP (VoIP) service providers.The ILECs have substantial capital and other resources, longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources.   We anticipate that by the end of 2006 approximately 27 million homeswill access to Comcast Digital Voice. We expect to migrate our circuit-switched phone customers to our Comcast Digital Voice service over the next several years. The competitive nature of the telephone business may negatively affect demand for andpricing of our phone services.    Advertising    Our cable systems compete against a wide variety of media for sales ofadvertising, including local television broadcast stations, national television broadcast networks, national and regional cable television networks, local radio broadcast stations, local and regional newspapers, magazines, and the Internet.Continuing competition from these media outlets and the continued expansion of new media outlets offering advertising opportunities may result in a dilution of the portion of advertising expenditures our cable systems currently receive.   Content Segment    The table below presents information as of December 31, 2005 relating to our six national cable networks:   Network  EconomicOwnershipPercentage   ApproximateU.S. Subscribers (in millions)   Description E! Entertainment Television  60.5% 79.3  Pop culture entertainment-related programming Style Network  60.5  35.2  Lifestyle-related programming The Golf Channel  99.9  57.0  Golf-related programming OLN  100.0  54.9  Sports and leisure programming G4  83.5  50.6  Gamer lifestyle programming AZN  100.0  13.7  Asian American programming   Revenue for ournetworks are principally generated from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators and satellite television companies that have typically entered into multi-year contracts to distribute ournetworks. To obtain long-term contracts with distributors, we may make cash payments, provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both. License fee revenues are reported net of the cost of incentives granted in exchangefor multi-year license contracts. Our networks and their distributors engage in ongoing marketing and promotional activities to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers. Although we believe prospects of continued carriage andmarketing of our networks by their larger distributors are generally good, the loss of one or more of them as distributors could have a material adverse effect on the affected network.   9 Table of ContentsCompetition    Our networks compete with other television programming services for distribution and programming. In addition, our networks compete with all other formsof programming provided to viewers (including broadcast networks, local broadcast stations, pay and other cable networks, home video, pay-per-view and VOD services and online activities), for viewers attention and audience share. Finally, ournetworks compete with other national and local media (including other television networks, television stations, radio stations, newspapers, Internet sites and direct mail) for advertising revenues.    Other Businesses    In addition to Comcast Spectacor, we also own non-controlling interests in various programming entities, including iNDEMAND, TV One, MGM, PBS KIDS Sprout, SportsChannel New England, New England Cable News, Pittsburgh Cable News Channel, Music Choice and Sterling Entertainment.   LEGISLATION AND REGULATION    Our video and phone services are subject to numerous requirements, prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws and regulations,local ordinances and our franchise agreements. Our high-speed Internet service, while not currently subject to significant regulation, may be subject to such regulation in the future. Our content businesses are, with limited exceptions, not subjectto direct governmental regulation. Laws and regulations affect the prices we can charge for some services, such as limited basic cable service and associated customer-premises equipment; the costs we incur (for example, for attaching our wires topoles owned by utility companies); the relationships we establish with our suppliers, subscribers and competitors; and many other aspects of our businesses.    The most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The provisions of the Communications Act andthe manner in which the FCC, state and local authorities, and the courts implement and interpret those provisions affect our ability to develop and execute business plans, our ability to raise capital and the competitive dynamics between and amongdifferent sectors of the communications and entertainment industries in which we operate. The FCC also has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders and theimposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of FCC licenses needed to operate some of the transmission facilities we use in connection with our cable business.    We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by,or under, the Communications Act, but we caution that the precise requirements of the law are not always clear. Moreover, many laws and regulations can be interpreted in after-the-fact enforcement proceedings or private-party litigation in a mannerthat is inconsistent with the judgments we have made. We also note that regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing rules or interpretations of existing rules, or prescribe new ones.Judicial decisions often alter the regulatory framework in ways that are inconsistent with regulator, business and investor expectations. In addition, our businesses can be significantly affected by the enactment of new legislation. Congressconsiders new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year, and a significant initiative to update the Communications Act began in 2005 and is expected to continue in 2006. We always face the risk that Congressor one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our businesses. In particular, we could be materially disadvantaged if we are subject to new laws or regulations that do not equally affect our satellite, wireline and wirelesscompetitors, or if our competitors are relieved of legal obligations that continue to apply to us or that currently apply only to them.    A major objective of Congress and the FCC has been to increase competition in all communications services, including those central to our business. Forexample, Congress has removed barriers to ILECs offering   10 Table of Contentsvideo services in their local service areas, and the FCC has taken additional steps that are encouraging ILECs to expand their investment in fiber-opticnetworks, which makes it easier for those companies to deliver video, high-speed Internet and other services. The FCC has also assigned spectrum licenses for MVDDS, a wireless service providing multichannel video programming. In addition, the FCC iscontinuing to adopt measures to increase the capacity for satellite-delivered services and has largely cleared the way for electric utilities to use their power lines to provide video and high-speed Internet services. Our businesses could beaffected by additional competitors that enter the video or high-speed Internet businesses as a result of these and similar efforts by Congress or the FCC. In particular, we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraintsthat do not apply equally to these new competitors, such as if ILECS that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us. For example, the State of Texas enactedlegislation in 2005 providing statewide franchises for new video service providers on terms less burdensome than our existing local franchise requirements. Other states where we have significant operations are considering similar legislation.   The following paragraphs describe existing and potentialfuture legal and regulatory requirements that are the most significant to our businesses today.    Time Warner Divestiture    The FCC approved the Broadband acquisition in November 2002, subject to various conditions. The most significant were a requirement for the divestiture of our interests in Time Warner and its cable affiliates by November 2007 (subject to asix-month extension), a requirement that the interests be placed in trust pending divestiture, and safeguards that limit our involvement in Time Warner Cables programming-related activities pending divestiture. Complying with these conditionshas limited and will continue to limit our flexibility as to the timing and nature of a sale or other disposition of the interests and, in the interim, may constrain our business dealings with Time Warner. We have fully complied with theseconditions and are committed to meeting our obligations under the FCCs order.    Adelphia Acquisition    We have filed a jointapplication with Time Warner and Adelphia seeking the FCCs approval of the acquisition of the Adelphia cable systems. The proposed Adelphia transactions also would accomplish the divestiture of our part of the Time Warner Cable interests asrequired by the FCC. The FCC is expected to make its decision by the end of the first half of 2006. We cannot predict whether the FCC will approve the application or whether, if it does approve the application, it will do so subject to unfavorableconditions.    Ownership Limits    The FCC is considering imposing horizontal ownership limits thatwould limit the percentage of multichannel video subscribers that any single cable provider could serve nationwide. A federal appellate court struck down the previous 30% limit, and the FCC is now considering this issue anew. We serve approximately28% of multichannel video subscribers and will still be under the previous 30% limit after the completion of pending acquisitions. If the FCC were to reinstate ownership limits similar to those previously imposed, such limits would restrict ourability to take advantage of future growth opportunities. The FCC is also assessing whether it should reinstate vertical ownership limits on the number of affiliated programming services a cable operator may carry on its cable systems(the previous limit of 40% of the first 75 channels was also invalidated by the federal appellate court). New vertical limits could affect our content business. In addition, the FCC is considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules thatwould affect which cable subscribers are counted under any horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted for purposes of any vertical ownership limit. It is uncertain when the FCC will rule on these issues.   11 Table of ContentsPricing and Packaging    The Communications Act and the FCCs regulations and policies limit the prices that cable systems may charge for limited basic service, equipment andinstallation. These rules do not apply to cable systems that are determined by the FCC to be subject to effective competition, but these determinations have thus far been made for only a small number of our cable systems. Failure tocomply with these rate rules could result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers. From time to time, Congress and the FCC consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry, including proposals to require cableoperators to offer programming services on an a la carte or themed-tier basis instead of or in addition to the current packaged offerings. Our video service offerings currently include various service tiers (with availability varying depending onlevel of service, demographics and other factors), such as sports, Hispanic and our recently announced family tier. We cannot now predict whether or when Congress, the FCC or any other regulatory agency may adopt any new requirements with respect tothe pricing or packaging of video services and how such requirements, if adopted, would affect our cable and content businesses. Also, various competitors are trying to persuade the FCC and the Justice Department to limit our ability torespond to increased competition through offers, promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost. We believe our competitive pricing practices are lawful and pro-competitive. If we cannot makeindividualized offers to subscribers who would otherwise choose a different provider, our subscriber attrition may increase, or our overall prices may need to be reduced, or both.    Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent    Cable companies are currently subject to a requirement that they carry, without compensation, the programming transmitted by most commercial andnon-commercial local television stations (must-carry). Alternatively, local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for retransmission consent, which may enable popular stations to demand significantconcessions (such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks) as a condition of our ability to transmit the TV broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive. As part of the transition from analog to digital broadcasttransmission, Congress and the FCC gave each local broadcast station a digital channel, capable of carrying multiple programming streams, in addition to its current analog channel. In February 2005, the FCC voted to reject proposals to require cablecompanies to: (1) simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each broadcaster during the transition (cable companies must only carry the broadcasters analog signal during the transition or, if the broadcaster has alreadyreturned its analog channel, the broadcasters digital signal); and (2) carry the multiple program streams that can be transmitted in a broadcasters digital signal (cable companies must only carry the primary digital video stream of thebroadcaster after the broadcaster has returned its analog channel). Although the FCC has thus far ruled against such expanded must-carry requirements, we cannot predict whether such requirements may result from additional FCC proceedings, judicialproceedings or legislation. In general, if such expanded carriage requirements were adopted, we would have less freedom to allocate the usable spectrum of our cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to oursubscribers. This could diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers, particularly if such requirements are not imposed on our competitors.    Program Access    The Communications Act and the FCCs program access rules generally prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operatorsfrom favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video distributors, such as DBS, and limit the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators. The FCC has extended the exclusivity restrictionsthrough October 2007. The FCC has concluded that the program access rules generally do not apply to programming services, such as Comcast SportsNet (Philadelphia), that are delivered terrestrially. However, the FCC has indicated that it mayreconsider how it regulates cable operators with regional sports programming interests, and there has been some Congressional interest in extending the exclusivity prohibition to terrestrially-delivered programming. Any   12 Table of Contentsdecision by the FCC or Congress to apply new program access or program carriage regulations to cable operators could have an adverse impact on ourbusinesses.    Cable Equipment Issues    The FCC has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail availabilityof set-top boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital cable services. Currently, most cable customers access such services using a leased set-top box that integrates cable access security with other operating functions. EffectiveJuly 2007, cable operators must cease placing into service set-top boxes with integrated security. At that time, newly deployed leased set-top boxes and devices purchased at retail must rely on a separate piece of equipment, known as a CableCARD, toprovide access to digital cable services. We have urged elimination of the ban on integrated set-top boxes on the grounds that it unfairly singles out cable operators for regulation (the ban does not apply to DBS), limits consumer choice, increasesthe cost of set-top box equipment, and slows the deployment of digital cable services. Thus far, the FCC has rejected these arguments, indicating in a March 2005 decision that it would not revisit the issue of whether to eliminate the ban onintegrated set-top boxes. Certain cable companies have challenged the FCCs decision in federal court. It is uncertain how the court will rule on this appeal. The FCC also indicated in its March 2005 decision that it might consider furtherdeferrals of the July 2007 ban on integrated set-top boxes to the extent the cable industry makes adequate progress on software-based security solutions that can be downloaded to leased set-top boxes as well as retail equipment. If the FCC does notextend the deadline again and does not waive the rules for low-cost, limited-function set-top boxes, we will be forced to incur added costs in purchasing CableCARD-enabled set-top boxes and the associated CableCARDs.    In addition, the FCC has adopted rules to implement an agreement between thecable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of plug-and-play TV sets that can connect directly to the cable network and receive one-way, analog and digital cable services without the need for a set-topbox. We believe that we are substantially in compliance with these one-way plug-and-play requirements. Also, the cable, consumer electronics and other industries are currently negotiating an agreement for two-way, interactive plug-and-playequipment. The pace of these negotiations is affected by a host of complex technical, engineering, business, copy protection, licensing and other issues. Some in Congress and at the FCC are urging that the parties complete the negotiations by aspecific date or risk having the government impose deadlines on the parties or adopt rules even in the absence of an industry agreement. It is unclear how this process will unfold and how it will ultimately affect our cable business and our effortsto sell cable services at retail outlets.    Franchise Matters   Cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant tonon-exclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, these franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee topay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The Communications Act includes provisions governing the franchising process,including, among other things, renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal. We anticipate that our future franchise renewal prospects generally will be favorable.    Congress, the FCC and various state governments are considering measures thatwould lessen or eliminate franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace, including the ILECs. The State of Texas, for example, has enacted legislation to provide a statewide franchise to new entrants, thusrelieving them of the obligation to seek franchises in individual local service areas. That law is now being challenged in court, but it is uncertain how the court will rule on the matter. Other states are now considering similar legislation.Likewise, Congress and the FCC are considering proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for the ILECs and other new entrants. Congress is reviewing proposals to replace the local franchising process with a nationalprocess, which, if enacted, could benefit the ILECs. In addition, the FCC has launched a rulemaking intended to ease the franchising process for new entrants. We could be   13 Table of Contentsmaterially disadvantaged if proposals to change franchising rules for our competitors, but not for cable operators, are approved.    PEG/Leased Access    The Communications Act permits franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside the use of channels forpublic, educational and governmental (PEG) access programming. We provide substantial channel capacity and financial support for PEG programming. The Communications Act also requires a cable system with 36 or more channels to make available aportion of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator. To date, we have generally not been required to devote significant channelcapacity to leased access.    State and Local Taxes    Some states and localities are considering imposing new taxes, includingsales taxes, on the services we offer. We cannot predict at this time whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business.    High-Speed Internet Service    Historically, the ILECs have been required to share their high-speed Internet facilities (most commonly DSL) with unaffiliated third-party ISPs, whilecable companies generally faced no similar regulatory requirement for their cable high-speed Internet service. Some local governments and various competitors had advocated the imposition of regulatory requirements on how cable operators deal withthird-party ISPs. Only a few local governments actually imposed such requirements, and, in each case, the courts have invalidated them. In 2002, the FCC formally classified cable high-speed Internet service as an interstate informationservice, rather than a telecommunications service. Such classification meant that traditional telecommunications regulations would not apply to cable high-speed Internet service. That FCC decision was appealed, and, in June 2005,the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCCs classification of cable high-speed Internet service as an interstate information service. In response to the Supreme Courts decision, the FCC adopted rules in August 2005 according similarderegulatory treatment to the high-speed Internet offerings of the ILECs. Under the FCCs ruling, the ILECs will no longer be required to share their high-speed Internet facilities with third-party ISPs after a one-year phase-out period. It isuncertain what impact the FCCs ruling will have on the competitive position of our cable high-speed Internet business.    Congress and the FCC are considering proposals to establish the rights of end users of high-speed Internet services and regulate or restrict commercialagreements between providers of high-speed Internet services and content providers. These proposals come under the collective name of network neutrality. The FCC issued a non-binding policy statement in August 2005 establishing fourbasic principles to guide its ongoing policymaking activities regarding high-speed Internet and other broadband-related services. Those principles state that: (1) consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice;(2) consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement; (3) consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network; and (4) consumersare entitled to competition among network providers, application and service providers and content providers. The FCC required Verizon and AT&T to abide by these principles for a two-year period as a condition to the Verizon/MCI and AT&T/SBCmergers. Congress is also considering legislation to codify these or related principles, subject to various conditions. Any such rules or statutes could limit the ability of high-speed Internet providers to manage their networks (including their usefor other services), to obtain value for use of their networks, or to respond to competitive conditions. We cannot predict whether such rules or statutes will be approved.    The FCC has also imposed certain regulatory requirements on providers of high-speed Internet service. In August 2005, theFCC adopted rules generally requiring such providers (including cable operators) to comply   14 Table of Contentswith the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). Under these new rules, high-speed Internet service providers must implementcertain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. The rules are scheduled to go into effect in 2007, but are now subject to court challenge. We anticipate that our high-speedInternet services will comply with these new requirements.    Congress and the FCC are considering additional proposals regarding the regulation of high-speed Internet services. For example, Congress is considering legislative proposals that would require high-speed Internet service providers toregister with the FCC and comply with various rules, including customer privacy, consumer service standards and access for persons with disabilities. Likewise, the FCC has initiated rulemakings on whether it should develop a framework for consumerprotection requirements for all providers of high-speed Internet services, regardless of the underlying technology, and also whether local and state authorities should be permitted to do so. It is uncertain what, if any, laws or regulations Congressor the FCC might ultimately impose on cable high-speed Internet or competing services. In addition, certain local governments are pursuing regulation of high-speed Internet services. For example, one local franchise authority has already imposedcustomer service requirements and made them a condition of our cable franchise agreement, and other local governments may attempt to do so. Also, a few franchising authorities have sued us seeking payment of franchise fees on high-speed Internetservice revenues.    Internet Regulation    Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measuresaffecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, copyright protection, defamation liability, taxation, obscenity and unsolicited commercial e-mail. Further, state and local governmental organizations have also adoptedInternet-related regulations. These various governmental bodies are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as pricing, service and product quality, and intellectual property ownership. The adoption of new laws or theadaptation of existing laws to the Internet could have a material adverse effect on our high-speed Internet service.    Phone Service    Our circuit-switched phone services are subject to federal, state and local regulation. In general, the Communications Act imposes interconnectionrequirements and universal service contribution obligations on all telecommunications service providers, including those that provide circuit-switched phone services over cable facilities, and more significant regulations on ILECs. Thesecommon carrier rules, however, are being re-evaluated at the FCC and in Congress. The FCC has already adopted measures relieving the ILECs of certain obligations to make elements of their networks available to competitors at cost-based rates. TheFCC has also initiated rulemakings on intercarrier compensation, universal service and other matters that, in the aggregate, could significantly change the rules that apply to telephone competition, including the relationship between wireless andwireline providers, long-distance and local providers, and incumbents and new entrants. It is unclear how those proceedings (and the litigation and implementation proceedings that are already underway as a product of one of these rulemakingproceedings) will affect our circuit-switched phone services.    The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to consider whether and how to regulate VoIP and other IP-enabled services. Among other things, the FCC will determine whether and how certain types of common carrier regulations should apply toVoIP services, including intercarrier compensation, universal service and the obligation to provide persons with disabilities with access to these services. The FCC has already adopted a number of orders addressing specific regulatory issuesrelating to VoIP. In May 2005, for example, the FCC adopted rules requiring VoIP service providers having certain characteristics to furnish enhanced 911 (E911) capabilities as a standard feature of their services. Additionally, VoIPservice providers must advise their customers of the circumstances under which E911 service may not be available and comply with other E911-related requirements specified by the FCC. We believe Comcast Digital Voice service complies with these new  15 Table of Contentsrequirements. Likewise, in August 2005, the FCC imposed CALEA-related requirements on VoIP service providers. We anticipate that Comcast Digital Voice willcomply with the new CALEA rules when they go into effect in 2007. Congress is also considering legislation that, if enacted, would impact the regulatory obligations of VoIP service providers. We cannot predict whether Congress will approve suchlegislation.    The FCC and Congress are also consideringmeasures relating to how VoIP service interconnects with the phone networks of the ILECs. In the circuit-switched environment, ILECs have a clear obligation to negotiate interconnection agreements with CLECs. However, it is uncertain whatinterconnection obligations the ILECs have with respect to VoIP service providers that do not obtain CLEC status. The FCC has yet to classify VoIP service for regulatory purposes. While classification of VoIP as an information service would bebeneficial to VoIP providers (including Comcast Digital Voice), since legacy telecommunications service regulations presumably would not apply, such classification might lead ILECs to resist interconnecting directly with VoIP providers. In light ofthese concerns, VoIP service providers typically either secure CLEC authorization, or they obtain indirect interconnection to ILEC networks by contracting with existing CLECs, whose right to deal with the ILECs is clear under the Communications Actand FCC regulations. Comcast has arranged for such interconnection rights through our own CLECs. The FCC is considering this issue in its rulemaking on IP-enabled services, and Congress is considering the issue as well. It is uncertain whether andwhen the FCC or Congress will adopt further rules in this area and how such rules would affect our Comcast Digital Voice service.    In addition, several states have attempted to impose common carrier regulation on VoIP services. However, the FCC adopted an order in November 2004declaring that one particular VoIP service is not subject to state public utility regulation. Further, the FCC indicated that other types of VoIP services, such as those offered by cable companies, would not be subject to state public utilityregulation if they: require a broadband connection from the users location; require the use of IP-compatible customer premises equipment; and include a suite of integrated capabilities and features, able to be invoked sequentially orsimultaneously, that allows customers to manage personal communications dynamically. It is unclear how this ruling and other VoIP service-related proceedings at the federal and state levels, and related judicial proceedings, might affect our ComcastDigital Voice service.    Other Issues    There are a number of other regulatory matters under review by Congress, theFCC and other federal agencies that could affect our cable and content businesses.    Tier Buy Through. The Communications Act generally requires cable operators to allow subscribers to purchase premium or pay-per-view services without the necessity of subscribing to any tier of service,other than the limited basic service tier. The applicability of this rule in certain situations remains unclear, and adverse decisions by the FCC on this issue could affect our pricing and packaging of services.    Content Regulation. The Communications Act prohibits thetransmission of obscene programming over cable systems. Additionally, some parties have proposed that new laws or rules regulating indecent and violent programming be imposed on cable operators. It is uncertain whether and when any such laws will beenacted or regulations will be adopted and, if enacted or adopted, what impact such laws or regulations would have on our cable and content businesses.    MDU Access. The FCC has adopted rules intended to make it easier for multichannel video service providers to compete with established cableoperators in serving MDUs.    Pole Attachments.The Communications Act requires that telephone companies and other utilities (other than those owned by municipalities or cooperatives) provide cable systems with nondiscriminatory access to any pole or right-of-way controlled by the utility.The rates that utilities may charge for such access are regulated by the FCC or, alternatively, by states that certify to the FCC that they regulate such rates (several states in which we have cable systems have so certified). There is always thepossibility that the FCC or a state could increase   16 Table of Contentsthe pole attachment rate paid by cable operators. Additionally, higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the FCCstelecommunications services pole rates. The applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which various phone services are transmitted remain unclear, and there is a risk that we will face higher costs as our phonebusiness expands.    EAS and Closed Captioning.The FCC has adopted rules requiring cable operators to deliver Emergency Alert System (EAS) warnings via digital cable services, rather than just analog services. This change imposes new equipment costs on cable operators. The FCChas also adopted rules imposing closed captioning requirements on cable operators, broadcasters, programmers and others. Advocates for the hearing impaired have urged the FCC to toughen its rules on closed captioning compliance and enforcement. TheFCC has initiated a rulemaking to consider these and other proposals. If adopted, such expanded closed captioning requirements would impose further regulatory burdens on cable operators and programmers. The FCC has not indicated whether or when itwill adopt such rules.    ChildrensTelevision. The FCC has adopted rules that, among other things, limit the amount of commercials which may be aired in certain childrens programming to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays andrestrict the use of program characters or show hosts to sell products in commercials during or adjacent to childrens programming. The FCC adopted additional rules in 2004 that would also restrict the display of Internet website addresses inchildrens programming. Those additional rules have been stayed pending further rulemaking, and it is uncertain what rules the FCC will ultimately establish and how such rules will affect our cable and content businesses.    Privacy Regulation. The Communications Act generally restrictsthe nonconsensual collection and disclosure of subscribers personal information by cable operators. There are possible interpretations of the Communications Act that could severely limit the ability of service providers to collect and usepersonal information for commercial purposes. Congress is now considering legislation that would extend these and other privacy requirements to high-speed Internet service and VoIP providers. Further constraints could also be imposed if and to theextent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy standards. In addition, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and many states have adopted rules that limit the telemarketing practices of cable operators and other commercialentities.    Copyright Regulation. In exchange forfiling certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals. The U.S. Copyright Office hasrecommended that Congress revise this compulsory licensing scheme, although Congress has thus far declined to do so. The elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certainprogramming and substantially increase our programming costs. Further, the Copyright Office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services. In addition, we pay standardindustry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create, including our cable businesses local advertising and local origination programming, and our content businesses original programs. These licensing fees have been the sourceof litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.    Broadcast Flag. The FCC adopted rules in 2003 requiring cable operators to implement the broadcastflag, a code that may be embedded in digital broadcast programming that directs digital TVs and other consumer electronics equipment to block the redistribution of such content over the Internet. These rules, if implemented, would have likelyaffected the design of cable-related equipment and home-networking technologies. However, in 2005, a federal appeals court invalidated the broadcast flag rules on the grounds that the FCC lacked jurisdiction under the Communications Act topromulgate them. Congress is considering proposals to reinstate the rules. Thus far, those efforts have been unsuccessful, but we cannot predict whether Congress will eventually approve legislation to revive the broadcast flag rules and, if adopted,how such legislation would affect cable operators.   17 Table of ContentsOther Areas. The FCC actively regulates other aspects of our cable and content businesses,including, among other things: (1) the mandatory blackout of syndicated, network and sports programming; (2) customer service standards; (3) political advertising; (4) origination cablecasting (i.e., programming locallyoriginated by and under the control of the cable operator); (5) sponsorship identification; (6) equal employment opportunity; (7) lottery programming; (8) program carriage; (9) recordkeeping and public file accessrequirements; and (10) technical standards relating to operation of the cable network. We are not aware that the FCC is considering any significant revisions to these rules at this time, but we are unable to predict how these regulations mightbe changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and content businesses.    EMPLOYEES    As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 80,000 employees (including part-time employees). Of these employees, approximately 62,000 were associated with cable and approximately 18,000 were associated with our other divisions.Approximately 4,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.    CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so thatinvestors can better understand a companys future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify theseso-called forward-looking statements by words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates,predicts, potential, or continue, or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements are only our predictions. In evaluating those statements, you shouldspecifically consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in Risk Factors
 under Item 1A and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results may differ materially from any of ourforward-looking statements.    Additionally, we operate in ahighly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. The environment is affected by government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions, consumer response to new and existing products and services,technological developments and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from managements expectations because of changes in suchfactors. Other factors and risks could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results of our businesses in the future and could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    All of theservices offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations.    Our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news, information and entertainment programming to consumers. We competedirectly with other program distributors, including satellite companies, telephone companies, companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve, and companies that offer programming and other communications services toour subscribers and potential subscribers, including high-speed Internet and IP-enabled phone. This competition may adversely affect our business and operations materially in the future.    Programming costs are increasing, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.    We expect our programming costs to continue to be our largest single expenseitem in the foreseeable future. In recent years, the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of   18 Table of Contentsprogramming. If we are unable to raise our subscribers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, theincreasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our operating results. In addition, as we add programming to our video services, we may face increased programming costs that, in conjunction with the additional pricing constraints, mayreduce operating margins.    We also expect to be subject toincreasing demands by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers. We cannot predict the impact of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we failto obtain the required consents.    We are subject to regulation by federal,state and local governments, which may impose costs and restrictions.    Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the cable industry and the circuit-switched phone services industry and may begin regulating the Internet services industry. We expect that legislativeenactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases change the rights and obligations of cable companies and other entities under the Communications Act and other laws, possibly in ways that we have notforeseen. Congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year, and a significant initiative to update the Communications Act began in 2005 and is expected to continue in 2006. The results ofthese legislative, judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations. Local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems. We have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time totime. Local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal or transfer, and such concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in the future. In addition, we could be materially disadvantagedif we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors, such as if local telephone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements thatapply to us.    We may face increased competition because of technologicaladvances and new regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.    The ILECs are building wireline fiber-optic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas (and have begun to offerthis service in limited areas), in addition to marketing DBS service in certain areas. In addition, the ILECs and other companies offer DSL service, which provides Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds substantially greater thanthat of conventional analog modems. We expect other advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace, to occur in the future. Other new technologies and services may develop and may compete with services that cablesystems offer. The success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business operations. Moreover, in recent years, Congress has enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies intended to providea favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems.    We face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters, including litigation associated with the Broadband acquisition.    We are involved in various litigation matters, including those arising inthe ordinary course of business and those described under the caption Legal Proceedings in Item 3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among these matters is litigation associated with the Broadband acquisition and for whichAT&T controls the defense of the litigation. While we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, an adverse outcome in one or more ofthese matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations for any one period. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position.   19 Table of ContentsAcquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategicgoals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.    From time to time we have made acquisitions and have entered into other strategic transactions. For example, in April 2005 we entered into agreements with Time Warner to jointly acquire substantially all the assets of Adelphia; in April2005 we acquired a 20% interest in MGM; in October 2005 we agreed to buy the cable systems of Susquehanna Communications; and in November 2005 we entered into a joint venture with Sprint, Time Warner Cable, Cox and Advance/Newhouse to developproducts using wireless technology. In connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disruptrelationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant indebtedness, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows.    Our Chairman and CEO hasconsiderable influence over our operations.    Brian L.Roberts has significant control over our operations through his beneficial ownership of all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, which have a nondilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our common stock and separate approval rights over certain material transactions involving us.   "
