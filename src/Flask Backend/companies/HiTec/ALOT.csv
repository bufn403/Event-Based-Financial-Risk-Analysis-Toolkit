8,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2024-04-12,"Risk Factors
 The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations. Business and Industry Risks:  Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. Any decline in our customers’ markets or their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the 2020 grounding, suspension and subsequent slow restart of the Boeing B737 MAX, coupled with the 7 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the demand for our airborne printers, as well as for the related repairs and supplies, which negatively affected our business. Although we have experienced a significant recovery in the demand for our airborne printers following the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for new aircraft and travel, demand remains lower than it was pre-pandemic, and currently the outlook is uncertain. While demand for air travel has recently increased, the impact of air-safety incidents or of another viral pandemic or other widespread health emergency could negatively impact this trend in the future. Also, we believe that the pandemic negatively impacted our customers’ financial capacity materially enough to alter their strategies and industry dynamics, but the increase in travel demand has caused the industry profitability to rebound. Production or supply chain issues experienced by any aircraft manufacturer may cause aircraft deliveries to grow more slowly or decline, which would reduce demand for our products, and in turn harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. The markets for our products are characterized by evolving technologies which in turn affect our product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our data acquisition and recorder products. Failure to meet our customers’ changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or our plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. Operational and Business Strategy Risks: We are dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including: •Disruptions in the global supply chain; •Limited control over the manufacturing process; •Potential absence of adequate production capacity; •Potential delays in production lead times; •Unavailability of certain process technologies; •Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs; and •Exposure to rapid unplanned cost increases that cannot be adequately recovered by customer price increases due to market competition or contractual constraints. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes, fails to meet our quality standards, or imposes rapid price increases that we cannot recover in the market, we will have to identify alternate qualified subcontractors, take over the manufacturing ourselves, or redesign our products to use components from other suppliers. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost-competitive 8 basis. Any interruption in the supply, increase in the cost of the products manufactured by a third-party subcontractor, or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For certain components, assembled products and supplies, we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products, or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, there was a disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations were disrupted. The supply chain disruption continues to affect our business as it has become difficult to ramp up production as quickly as needed to respond to the post-COVID increase in customer demand. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source as well as incurring higher costs to obtain needed components. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply components, assembled products, or supplies in required volumes or at acceptable prices, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. For example, in fiscal 2023, we experienced increased difficulty in obtaining certain technology-based parts, components and supplies from the largest single supplier of our PI segment at stable or predictable prices. Additionally, we experienced repeated significant quality problems with that supplier. We have responded to these issues by increasing our inventories of those products to mitigate supply risk, negotiating quality related cost reimbursements, and in some cases, accelerating our development of PI products that rely on alternative suppliers. In fiscal 2024, we incurred $0.6 million of incremental expense relating to warranty services and implementation of corrective retrofits resulting from these issues.  Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We face significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services. For a variety of complex reasons, many of which were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the general economy has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions. Examples of some of these impacts on us include reduced availability of certain electronic components and the need to pay premium prices to obtain them, and noticeably higher costs for a wide array of other parts and raw material components in both of our product segments. Additionally, due to supply chain disruptions, it has become more difficult to obtain the needed components for our legacy T&M products, and as a result we have incurred higher costs to obtain these components. The supply chain disruptions have been exacerbated by increases in the cost of transportation to expedite incoming components and supplies. In many cases, we have had to expedite delivery of critical materials through significantly higher cost airfreight methods. Our ability to offset these effects through pricing actions for our products and services may not prove sufficient to offset these or further cost increases. Attempts to increase prices may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. We are also continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. In fiscal 2024, we engaged in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure in our PI segment. However, if these efforts to constrain the cost of our operations are inadequate to offset higher product and employee wage costs, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. 9 Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property defend against assertions of infringement or the loss of certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that we currently own. The loss of our Honeywell license agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. We have significant inventories on hand. We maintain a significant amount of inventory, and as a result of recent supply chain disruptions and announced or anticipated price increases from suppliers, we have further increased the amount of inventory we maintain on hand to ensure we are able to meet market demand for our products at a reasonable price. These increases have been concentrated in label printing machines and supplies sold by our PI business, as well as in electronic components and assemblies in our T&M business. We maintain allowances for slow-moving and obsolete inventory that we believe are adequate, but any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. We have incurred and could in the future incur additional liabilities because of product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by customers. These defects could result in, among other things, increased warranty provisions, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, or damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects. While in the past, we have successfully obtained partial compensation from suppliers for their contribution to product quality issues, we may not be successful in such a recovery in the future, and these recoveries have not in the past and are not in the future likely to fully offset the full financial impact on us. For example, in fiscal 2023, the quality of products obtained from one of the key suppliers to our PI segment declined and we were unable to detect latent defects in their products in a timely manner, which resulted in our incurring increased technical service and warranty expenses. We obtained partial compensation from that supplier, but this was insufficient to fully cover all of our costs related to this issue. We also believe we have experienced demand declines as a result of customers’ perceptions of the quality defects related to this supplier. In fiscal 2024, we continued to have quality and reliability issues in certain models of our PI printers as a result of faulty ink provided by one of our larger suppliers. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024,  we initiated a program to retrofit all of the printers sold to our customers that were affected by the faulty ink at a total cost of $0.6 million. If  we continue to experience product failures due to design or manufacturing defects, our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future, assume liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that may not have been subjected to adequate product development, testing and quality control processes, and may have unknown or undetected defects. Some types of defects may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause us to incur significant warranty, repair, or re-engineering costs. As such, it could also divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, which may result in increased costs and lower profitability. We could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. We rely on on-premise and cloud-based information technology systems, some of which are managed by or licensed from third parties, to support many critical aspects of our business, as well as to process, transmit and store our own electronic proprietary or confidential information, and confidential information of customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other proprietary confidential information. These systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions and/or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber-criminals, data breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events, or other unforeseen events. These vulnerabilities could interfere with our operations, compromise our data processing capacity and the security of our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We actively manage these risks through a variety of hardware and software-based techniques that we own, license, or otherwise procure from third parties under contract to safeguard our systems, and we own or procure from third parties system data storage redundancy and disaster recovery capability. In particular, we have increased our investment in tools, techniques and training that we believe will reduce our vulnerability to attacks from cyber-criminals. However, due to the complexity of our systems, and especially due to the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, there is no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks, security 10 breaches, or the other potential exploitation of vulnerabilities or systems failures. In any such circumstance, our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. However, in the future, such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our brand and reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain insurance for a variety of cybersecurity risks to mitigate their possible impact, but because of the prevalence of claims in the market for cybersecurity insurance, the cost for that insurance has increased and the underwriting criteria to obtain such insurance has become far more demanding. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future, despite our substantial investments in cybersecurity, and if we are able to do so, it may be at substantially higher costs. In addition, in response to these higher costs, we may choose to reduce the amount of insurance we maintain because we believe our improvements in our cybersecurity profile have reduced our risk exposure relative to the increased cost of insurance. If our risk assessments prove incorrect and we were to have a loss not fully covered by insurance, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted. We depend on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources, could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain, through competitive compensation and benefits programs, professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel as well as our ability to manage human capital resources. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate adequately qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we must maintain competitive compensation and benefits, and we may also be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, several key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, regulatory and customer quality compliance management, and financial management issues. The loss of any of these employees as the result of competitive compensation pressures or ineffective management of human capital resources could harm our ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could impede our ability to grow and could result in our inability to operate our business profitably. Although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, and the demand for qualified individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Any sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, could lead to increased costs and lost profitability and could otherwise compromise our ability to efficiently operate our business. We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. Financial and Economic Risks: We face risks related to recession, inflation, stagflation and other economic conditions. Customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recession, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or the expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions, or reduce their use of 11 our services. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of additional charges if we request changes in delivery schedules or if suppliers incur additional costs that they pass on to us. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession, our suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges and, as a result, they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands or collect revenue or could otherwise harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like if at all, and our borrowing costs could increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, our business and financial results could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we are subject to risks from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components, supplies, and raw materials, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components, supplies and other raw materials have from time to time become restricted. General market factors and conditions have in the past and may in the future affect pricing of such components, supplies, and commodities. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenue for fiscal 2024, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: •Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; •Customer and vendor financial stability; •Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; •Changes in a specific country’s or region’s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory, or other conditions; •Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; •Negative consequences from changes in tax laws; •Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters; •Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing; •Differing labor regulations; •Failure to comply with complex and rapidly changing government economic sanctions against other countries, especially arising from responses to armed conflict; •Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To date, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions and our decision to halt all activities in the affected areas has had an immaterial direct impact on our revenues. We believe, however, that the impact on the economies of Western Europe, especially Germany, which is the largest non-North American market for our products, has had a negative impact on demand for our products. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations. 12 Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof, the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow. We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years. If we are unable to successfully comply with our credit agreement with Bank of America or secure alternative financing, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. requires us, among other things, to satisfy certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis, consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and an asset coverage ratio. We are also required to comply with other covenants and conditions, set forth in the credit agreement, including, among others, limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to repurchase or acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set forth in the credit agreement. If we were to violate the terms of the credit agreement and we were unable to renegotiate its terms at that time or secure alternative financing, it could have a material adverse impact on us. The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. contains, and any future debt agreements may include several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to: •Incur future indebtedness; •Place liens on assets; •Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock; •Repurchase or acquire our capital stock; •Conduct mergers or acquisitions; •Sell assets; and/or •Alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness. 13 We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business. We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our August 2022 acquisition of Astro Machine LLC. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete, we cannot be certain that: •We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own; •All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized; •Management’s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations; •Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business; •Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition; •Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; •We will successfully implement effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting at the acquired business in a timely fashion; and •Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. For example, in the recently acquired Astro Machine business, revenues are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. Failure to satisfy the delivery requirements of those customers or to adequately respond to their evolving product requirements could cause us to lose one or more customers which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation due to lower revenue and could result in intangible asset impairment. In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions, such as the Astro Machine acquisition, may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks. We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: •Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; •Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and •Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. We continually review our operations with a view toward reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and increasing our revenues and operating margins. For example, in fiscal 2024 we implemented a restructuring plan in our PI segment to reduce operating costs within that segment.  As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes, or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets or sell certain assets. In any of these events our costs may increase, and we may have significant charges or losses associated with the write-down or divestiture of assets. 14 Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks. At the end of fiscal 2024, we had approximately $4.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position. To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counterparties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Inadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee healthcare benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition. In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums. We record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends and data provided by our insurance broker. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of losses. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Legal and Regulatory Risks: Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business. In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. We are subject to regulatory constraints and compliance requirements due to our status as a publicly held company. Public company compliance costs are increasing due to the increase in SEC regulations and enforcement actions, and the heightened scrutiny that we and the public accounting industry face from the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board. Additionally, certain new and proposed regulations in the State of Rhode Island, where we are headquartered, are likely to increase compliance costs. In some instances, the regulations may mandate action on our part for which, to our knowledge, no current technical means to comply exist. If enacted, the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our business outside of the United States exposes us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, employee rights and protection, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to 15 government officials and other third parties. For example, the increased use of sanctions in U.S. international relations recently has increased our cost of compliance with the regulations intended to enforce them. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and any inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, could adversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in our company. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that weakness has led to a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2024. The material weakness related to our failure to design and maintain an effective control environment at our Astro Machine subsidiary, which was acquired in August of 2022.  Management is taking action to remediate this material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting by designing an effective control environment and expanding our existing enterprise resource planning system to include the Astro Machine subsidiary.If action to remediate this material weakness is not completed on a timely basis, or if other remediation efforts are not successful, we may, in the future, identify additional internal control deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover other errors in financial reporting. Failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, or provide reliable financial statements needed for business decision processes, and our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additionally, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. Also, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in sanctions by regulatory authorities. Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under those environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Certain of our products contain, and some of manufacturing operations use various substances which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. Thus, we have and will continue to generate a generally limited amounts of hazardous waste in our operations. We manage our compliance with laws and regulations and the proper mitigation of risks internally and through the input of external consultants and outside service providers and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We desire to reduce and ultimately eliminate any adverse environmental impact of our business and to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We expect this effort to affect our ongoing operations and require additional capital and operating expenditures. If we were to fail to manage our environmental compliance effectively, we could suffer economic or reputational harm. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies. Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly. We collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the 16 storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations. We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. These requirements are complicated, and compliance is technically complex to maintain. We contract with outside experts to advise us, conduct internal and external compliance training, and believe we are currently in compliance, however, maintaining compliance has increased costs and diverted resources. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. All these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. While we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct. Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, income taxes, and warranties, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition"
2,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2023-04-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Business and Industry Risks:  The structural impacts on the economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  All of our global operations were materially adversely affected by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and the related supply-chain disruptions. The aftermath of the immediate severe impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance, the changes in our customers’ purchasing behavior, the post-pandemic impact of inflation from macroeconomic factors, and the continued and lingering structural impacts on our global supply chain, particularly with respect to the availability and costs of electronic components, have made planning for customer demand and manufacturing production more difficult. Also, it has led to a rise in the cost of a number of classes of acquired goods for both the T&M and PI segments. We will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and its aftermath effects on our business, results of operations and cash flows throughout fiscal 2024, including the potential impacts on various estimates and assumptions inherent in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Since the COVID-19 pandemic began we have experienced difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for our products. Some of the structural dislocations in the global economy that were triggered by the pandemic are prolonging these difficulties. Particularly with respect to certain electronic components for legacy products in our T&M segment, availability has been curtailed and may not recover, and in certain cases we have had to accelerate product redesign efforts and quickly transition customers to products with more viable   8  long-term product configurations. We expect to incur substantial costs in doing so but we are unable to accurately estimate the financial impact due to the rapidly changing environment. We also have had to incur additional costs, such as higher shipping fees (i.e., air rather than ocean freight) and though these have abated to a degree, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. These factors negatively impacted our efficiency, delayed shipments in each of the fiscal quarters of 2023, and caused what we believe are product shortages. We are addressing these issues through long-range planning and procuring higher inventory levels for affected items to help mitigate potential shortages whenever practicable. For our T&M segment, we are also monitoring and reacting to extended lead times on electronic components, and utilizing a variety of strategies, including blanket orders, vendor-bonded inventories, extended commitments to our supply base, and seeking alternative suppliers. Additionally, we have taken actions to increase regular contact with our essential vendors and increased our forecasting horizon for our products to help us better manage our supply chain. In some cases, we are working with our vendors to help them procure components. Similarly, in our PI segment, we are increasing our inventory levels to ensure the adequacy of the supplies we sell to customers who use our printers. Our strategies to counteract these supply chain dislocations have significantly increased the amount of inventory we maintain to support our product sales. We have also experienced several situations where component shortages and scarcity have required us to pay significantly higher costs to obtain those components, particularly electronic components and circuit board assemblies in the T&M segment and inks and printer machine parts in the PI segment. We will continue to monitor our supply chain going forward and update our mitigation strategies as we determine appropriate. We are not able to predict how current supply chain difficulties will develop in the future, and if the steps we are taking are not effective, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  Our PI business was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as it limited our ability to meet with customers to demonstrate our products at trade shows and on-site in their facilities was curtailed. We partially countered this through a variety of virtual, on-line selling and digital marketing strategies, a number of which we continue to emphasize today. The degree to which post-pandemic selling practices will revert to those that were dominant previously, and the ultimate mix of customer engagement methods of face-to-face selling versus digital selling methods remains uncertain. For example, throughout fiscal 2023 we have attended numerous trade shows, but demand generation through those selling methods have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We believe that digital marketing has become a more permanent element of our go-to-market strategy. This has required us to shift resources to those technologies. Further, in the PI segment, the timely and reliable delivery of acceptable quality printer components from certain of our suppliers has declined post-pandemic, causing us to incur additional direct procurement costs, to carry higher inventories to assure adequate supplies to satisfy customers, to incur additional warranty and technical service costs to offset those impacts and to accelerate alternative technology development.  The aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both inside and outside of the United States because of the severe decline in the demand for air travel, demand for aircraft, and a general curtailment of aircraft production rates. This had a material adverse impact on our financial results. Now that air travel demand and aircraft production demand have substantially improved, the direct and secondary impacts of the demand decline have abated, but demand for our products has not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Our current belief is that it may take two or more years before we reach full revenue recovery, and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic structure of the airline industry, and general economic conditions could still become a negative factor for demand for aircraft, which could stall or reverse current favorable trends. If this were to happen individually or in combination, these factors would be difficult for us to respond to quickly, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.   9  Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Any decline in our customers’ markets or their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the 2020 grounding, suspension and subsequent slow restart of production of the Boeing 737 MAX, coupled with the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for new aircraft and travel, reduced the demand for our airborne printers, as well as for the related repairs and supplies which has negatively affected our results of operations. While these effects have been abating, demand remains lower than it was pre-pandemic, and currently the outlook is uncertain. While demand for air travel has recently increased, the impact of another viral pandemic or other widespread health emergency could negatively impact this trend in the future. Also, we believe that the pandemic has negatively impacted our customers’ financial capacity materially enough to alter their strategies and industry dynamics so as to make changes in their demand more volatile. These factors may in particular cause demand for aircraft to grow slowly or decline, which would reduce demand for our products, and in turn harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by evolving technologies which in turn effect our product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our data acquisition and recorder products. Failure to meet our customers’ changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or our plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.  Operational and Business Strategy Risks:  We are dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:    •  Disruptions in the global supply chain;    •  Limited control over the manufacturing process;   10   •  Potential absence of adequate production capacity;    •  Potential delays in production lead times;    •  Unavailability of certain process technologies;    •  Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs and    •  Exposure to rapid unplanned cost increases that cannot be adequately recovered by customer price increases due to market competition or contractual constraints.  If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes, fails to meet our quality standards, or imposes rapid price increases that we cannot recover in the market, we will have to identify alternate qualified subcontractors, take over the manufacturing ourselves, or redesign our products to use components from other suppliers. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost-competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply, increase in the cost of the products manufactured by a third-party subcontractor or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembled products and supplies, we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, there was a disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations were disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.  Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes or at acceptable prices, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. For example, in fiscal 2023, we experienced increased difficulty in obtaining certain technology-based parts, components and supplies from the largest single supplier of our PI segment at stable or predictable prices. Additionally, we experienced repeated significant quality problems with that supplier. We have responded to these issues by increasing our inventories of those products to mitigate supply risk, negotiating quality related cost reimbursements, and in some cases, accelerating our development of PI products that rely on alternative suppliers. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We face significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based   11  on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure.   Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services. For a variety of complex reasons, many of which were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the general economy has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions. Examples of some of these impacts on us include reduced availability of certain electronic components and the need to pay premium prices to obtain them, and noticeably higher costs for a wide array of other parts and raw material components in both of our product segments. This has been exacerbated by increases in the cost of transportation to expedite incoming components and supplies. In many cases, we have had to expedite delivery of critical materials through significantly higher cost airfreight methods. Our ability to offset these effects through pricing actions for our products and services may not prove sufficient to offset these or further cost increases. Attempts to increase prices may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We are also continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time, we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. However, if these efforts to constrain the cost of our operations are inadequate to offset higher product and employee wage costs, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property defend against assertions of infringement or the loss of certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.  We rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that we currently own. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.  We have significant inventories on hand.  We maintain a significant amount of inventory, and as a result of recent supply chain disruptions and announced or anticipated price increases from suppliers, we have further increased the amount of inventory we maintain on hand to ensure we are able to meet market demand for our products at a reasonable price. These   12  increases have been concentrated in label printing machines and supplies sold by our PI business, as well as in electronic components and assemblies in our T&M business. We maintain allowances for slow-moving and obsolete inventory that we believe are adequate, but any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  We have incurred and could in the future incur additional liabilities because of product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by customers. These defects could result in, among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects. While in the past, we have successfully obtained partial compensation from suppliers for their contribution to product quality issues, we may not be successful in such a recovery in the future, and these recoveries have not in the past and are not in the future likely to fully offset the full financial impact on us. For example, in fiscal 2023, the quality of products obtained from one of the key suppliers to our PI segment declined and we were unable to detect latent defects in their products in a timely manner, which resulted in our incurring increased technical service and warranty expenses. We obtained partial compensation from that supplier, but this was insufficient to fully cover all of our costs related to this issue. We also believe we have experienced demand declines as a result of customers’ perceptions of the quality defects related to this supplier.  In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that may not have been subjected to adequate product development, testing and quality control processes, and may have unknown or undetected defects. Some types of defects may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause us to incur significant warranty, repair or re-engineering costs. As such, it could also divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, which may result in increased costs and lower profitability.  We could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  We rely on on-premise and cloud-based information technology systems, some of which are managed by or licensed from third parties, to support many critical aspects of our business, as well as to process, transmit and store our own electronic proprietary or confidential information, and confidential information of customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other proprietary confidential information. These systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions and/or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber-criminals, data breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. These vulnerabilities could interfere with our operations, compromise our data processing capacity and the security of our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We actively manage these risks through a variety of hardware and software-based techniques that we own, license or otherwise procure from third parties under contract to safeguard our systems, and we own or procure from third parties system data storage redundancy and disaster recovery capability. In particular, we have increased our investment in tools, techniques and training that we believe will reduce our vulnerability to attacks from cyber-criminals. However, due to the complexity of our systems, and especially due to the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, there is no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks, security breaches, or the other potential exploitation of vulnerabilities or systems failures. In any such circumstance, our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. However, in the future, such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or   13  penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our brand and reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We maintain insurance for a variety of cybersecurity risks to mitigate their possible impact, but because of the prevalence of claims in the market for cybersecurity insurance, the cost for that insurance has increased and the underwriting criteria to obtain such insurance has become far more demanding. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future, despite our substantial investments in cybersecurity, and if we are able to do so, it may be at substantially higher costs. In addition, in response to these higher costs, we may choose to reduce the amount of insurance we maintain because we believe our improvements in our cybersecurity profile have reduced our risk exposure relative to the increased cost of insurance. If our risk assessments prove incorrect and we were to have a loss not fully covered by insurance, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.  We depend on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources, could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.  Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain, through competitive compensation and benefits programs, professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel as well as our ability to manage human capital resources. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate adequately qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we must maintain competitive compensation and benefits, and we may also be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, several key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, regulatory and customer quality compliance management, and financial management issues. The loss of any of these employees as the result of competitive compensation pressures or ineffective management of human capital resources could harm our ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could impede our ability to grow and could result in our inability to operate our business profitably.  Although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, and the demand for qualified individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Any sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, could lead to increased costs and lost profitability and could otherwise compromise our ability to efficiently operate our business.  We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.  We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.   14  Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.  Financial and Economic Risks:  We face risks related to recession, inflation, stagflation and other economic conditions.  Customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recession, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or the expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of additional charges if we request changes in delivery schedules or if suppliers incur additional costs that they pass on to us. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession, our suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges and, as a result, they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands or collect revenue or could otherwise harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like if at all, and our borrowing costs could increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, our business and financial results could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we are subject to risks from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components, supplies, and raw materials, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components, supplies and other raw materials have from time to time become restricted. General market factors and conditions have in the past and may in the future affect pricing of such components, supplies and commodities.  Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 35% of our total revenue for fiscal 2023, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:    •  Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;    •  Customer and vendor financial stability;    •  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;    •  Changes in a specific country’s or region’s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;    •  Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;    •  Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;    •  Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;   15   •  Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;    •  Differing labor regulations;    •  Failure to comply with complex and rapidly changing government economic sanctions against other countries, especially arising from responses to armed conflict;    •  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;    •  Uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly known as “Brexit”; and    •  Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  To date, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions and our decision to halt all activities in the affected areas has had an immaterial direct impact on our revenues. We believe, however, that the impact on the economies of Western Europe, especially Germany, which is the largest non-North American market for our products, has had a negative impact on demand for our products.  Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.   As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.  Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof, the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.  We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.  We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made.   16  Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.  If we are unable to successfully comply with our credit agreement with Bank of America or secure alternative financing, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Our credit agreement with Bank of America requires us, among other things, to satisfy certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis, consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and an asset coverage ratio. We are also required to comply with other covenants and conditions, set forth in the credit agreement, including, among others, limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to repurchase or acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set forth in the credit agreement. If we were to violate the terms of the credit agreement and we were unable to renegotiate its terms at that time or secure alternative financing, it could have a material adverse impact on us.  The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:    •  Incur future indebtedness;    •  Place liens on assets;    •  Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock;    •  Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;    •  Conduct mergers or acquisitions;    •  Sell assets; and/or    •  Alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our August 2022 acquisition of Astro Machine LLC and 2017 acquisition of TrojanLabel. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete, we cannot be certain that:    •  We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;   17   •  All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;    •  Management’s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;    •  Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;    •  Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;    •  Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and    •  Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.  For example, in the recently acquired Astro Machine business, revenues are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. Failure to satisfy the delivery requirements of those customers or to adequately respond to their evolving product requirements could cause us to lose one or more customers which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation due to lower revenue and could result in intangible asset impairment.  In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions, such as the Astro Machine acquisition, may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:    •  Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;    •  Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and    •  Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.  We continually review our operations with a view toward reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and increasing our revenues and operating margins. As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes, or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets or sell certain assets. In any of these events our costs may increase, and we may have significant charges or losses associated with the write-down or divestiture of assets.   18  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.  At the end of fiscal 2023, we had approximately $3.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.  To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counterparties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.  Inadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee healthcare benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.  In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.  We record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends and data provided by our insurance broker. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of losses. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.  Legal and Regulatory Risks:  Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.  In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  We are subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.   19  We are subject to regulatory constraints and compliance requirements due to our status as a publicly held company. Public company compliance costs are increasing due to the increase in SEC regulations and enforcement actions, and the heightened scrutiny that we and the public accounting industry face from the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board. Additionally, certain new and proposed regulations in the State of Rhode Island, where we are headquartered, are likely to increase compliance costs. In some instances, the regulations may mandate action on our part for which, to our knowledge, no current technical means to comply exist. If enacted, the costs to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Our business outside of the United States exposes us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, employee rights and protection, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties. For example, the increased use of sanctions in U.S. international relations recently has increased our cost of compliance with the regulations intended to enforce them.  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and any inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, could adversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in our company.  We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that weakness has led to a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2023. The material weakness related to our inability to maintain effective controls to properly identify and assess significant non-routine transactions. Management is taking action to remediate the deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting by augmenting resources in our financial organization.  If action to remediate this material weakness is not completed on a timely basis, or if other remediation efforts are not successful, we may, in the future, identify additional internal control deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover other errors in financial reporting.  Failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, or provide reliable financial statements needed for business decision processes, and our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additionally, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. Also, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in sanctions by regulatory authorities.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under those environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Certain of our products contain, and some of manufacturing operations use various substances which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. Thus, we have and will continue to generate a generally limited amounts of hazardous waste in our operations. We manage our compliance with laws and regulations and the proper mitigation of risks internally and through the input of external consultants and outside service providers and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We desire to reduce and ultimately eliminate any adverse environmental impact of our   20  business and to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We expect this effort to affect our ongoing operations and require additional capital and operating expenditures. If we were to fail to manage our environmental compliance effectively, we could suffer economic or reputational harm.  Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.  We collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations.  We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. These requirements are complicated and compliance is technically complex to maintain. We contract with outside experts to advise us, conduct internal and external compliance training, and believe we are currently in compliance, however, maintaining compliance has increased costs and diverted resources. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.  Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. All these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.  While we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct.   21  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, income taxes, and warranties, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition"
4,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2022-04-18,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Business and Industry Risks:  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  All of our global operations have been materially adversely affected by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic during the past two years. We expect this adverse impact to continue to a degree that we cannot predict.  We made significant modifications to our global pre-pandemic operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We initially required most non-production related team members to work remotely. Although this no longer is required for health and safety reasons, for many of our team members, remote work has become a preference and we believe we have to a large degree successfully adapted to it through the use of technology and changed management practices, but further adaptations, unknown at this time, may be required. As the result of the changes that have been required by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the mix of on-site and remote work will be permanently changed, as will our increased safety protocols and the other adaptations undertaken during the pandemic, but our practices and plans are still developing, and we cannot predict the result yet.    8    Table of Contents   Since the COVID-19 pandemic began we have experienced difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for our products. Some of the structural dislocations in the global economy caused by the pandemic are deepening and prolonging these difficulties. We have had to incur additional costs, such as expedited and express shipping fees (i.e., air rather than ocean freight.) These difficulties have also negatively impacted our efficiency, delayed shipments and caused product shortages. We are currently monitoring the world-wide delays in transit time, as freight carriers continue to experience significant delays in overseas shipments. We are addressing these issues through long range planning and procuring higher inventory on severely allocated items to help mitigate potential shortages whenever practicable. We are also monitoring and reacting to extended lead times on electronic components and utilizing a variety of strategies, including blanket orders, vendor-bonded inventories, extended commitments to our supply base, and seeking alternative suppliers. Additionally, we have taken actions to increase regular contact with our essential vendors and increased our forecasting horizon for our products to help us better manage our supply chain. In some cases, we are working with our vendors to help them procure components. Our strategies to counteract the impact of the pandemic and the related supply chain dislocations have increased the amount of inventory we maintain to support our product sales. We have also experienced several situations where component shortages and scarcity have required us to pay significantly higher costs to obtain those components. We will continue to monitor our supply chain going forward and update our mitigation strategies as we determine appropriate. We are not able to predict how current supply chain difficulties will develop in the future, and if the steps we are taking are not effective, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Our Product Identification business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic because our ability to meet with customers to demonstrate our products at trade shows and on-site in their facilities has been curtailed. We have partially countered this through a variety of virtual, on-line selling and digital marketing strategies, but the degree to which this will be successful to mitigate the lack of face-to-face selling is unclear.  The aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has also been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both inside and outside of the United States because of the severe decline in the demand for air travel, demand for aircraft, and a general curtailment of aircraft production rates. This has had a material adverse impact on our financial results. While air travel demand and aircraft production demand has recovered to some extent, it remains unclear whether these demand factors will continue to recover, and to what extent. The secondary impacts of the demand decline and resulting financial losses on the economic structure of the airline industry could become a negative factor for demand for aircraft due to industry consolidation. Individually or in combination, these factors may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.  Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Any decline in our customers’ markets or their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the 2020 grounding, suspension and subsequent slow restart of production of the Boeing 737 MAX, and then the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for new aircraft, reduced demand for our airborne printers that are installed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies, which has negatively affected our results of operations. While these effects have begun to abate, demand remains lower than it was beforehand, and the outlook is uncertain. Some of our customers have been and may remain reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and may continue to defer certain of these purchases to future periods. While demand for air travel has recently increased, the impact of another period of COVID-19 infections could negatively impact this trend in the future. Also, we believe our customers’ markets have declined and the impact on their financial capacity has been material enough to alter their strategies and industry dynamics. These factors may cause demand for aircraft to grow slowly or decline, which would reduce our demand, and in turn which could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    9      Table of Contents   Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by evolving technologies which in turn effect our product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our acquisition and data recorder products. Failure to meet our customers’ changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or our plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.  Operational and Business Strategy Risks:  We are dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:    •  Disruptions in the global supply chain;        •  Limited control over the manufacturing process;        •  Potential absence of adequate production capacity;        •  Potential delays in production lead times;        •  Unavailability of certain process technologies; and        •  Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.      If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply, increase in the cost of the products manufactured by a third-party subcontractor or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.    10      Table of Contents   For certain components, assembled products and supplies, we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the continued global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been and likely will continue to be disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We face significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure.   Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services. For a variety of complex reasons, many of which were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the general economy has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions. Examples of some of these impacts on us include reduced availability of certain electronic components and the need to pay premium prices to obtain them, and noticeably higher costs for a wide array of other parts and raw material components. This has been exacerbated by significant increases in the cost of transportation to expedite incoming components and supplies. In many cases we have had to expedite delivery of critical materials through significantly higher cost airfreight methods. Our ability to offset these effects through pricing actions for our products and services may not prove sufficient to offset these or further cost increases. Attempts to increase prices may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We are also continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and    11      Table of Contents   outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time, we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. However, if these efforts to constrain the cost of our operations are inadequate to offset higher product and employee wage costs, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.  We rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that we currently own. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.  We have significant inventories on hand.  We maintain a significant amount of inventory, and a result of recent supply chain disruption expect to increase the amount of inventory we maintain on-hand. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as continued reduced demand for our products if the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  We have incurred and could in the future incur additional liabilities because of product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects. While in the past, we have successfully obtained partial compensation from suppliers for their contribution to product quality issues, we may not be successful in such a recovery in the future, and these recoveries have not in the past and are not in the future likely to fully offset the full financial impact on us.  In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to adequate product development, testing and quality control processes, and may have unknown or undetected defects. Some types of defects may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause us to incur significant warranty, repair or re-engineering costs. As such, it could also divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts which may result in increased costs and lower profitability.  We could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  We rely on on-premises and cloud-based information technology systems, some of which are managed by or licensed from third parties, to support many critical aspects of our business, as well as, to process, transmit and    12      Table of Contents   store our own electronic proprietary or confidential information, and confidential information of customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other proprietary confidential information.    These systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions and/or shutdowns due to attack by cyber-criminals, data breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. These vulnerabilities could interfere with our operations, compromise our data processing capacity and the security of our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We actively manage these risks through a variety of hardware and software-based techniques that we own, license or otherwise procure from third parties under contract to safeguard our systems, and we own or procure from third parties system data storage redundancy and disaster recovery capability. In particular we have increased our investment in tools, techniques and training that we believe will reduce our vulnerability to attacks from cyber-criminals. However due to the complexity of our systems, and especially due to the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, there is no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks, security breaches, or the other potential exploitation of vulnerabilities or systems failures. In any such circumstance, our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. However, in the future such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our brand and reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We depend on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources, could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.  Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain, through competitive compensation and benefits programs, professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel as well as our ability to manage human capital resources. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we must maintain competitive compensation and benefits, and we may also be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, several key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues. The loss of any of these employees as the result of competitive compensation pressures or ineffective management of human capital resources could harm our ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could impede our ability to grow and could result in our inability to operate our business profitably.  Although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, and the demand for qualified individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Any sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors or wage competition, could lead to increased costs and lost profitability and could otherwise compromise us in efficiently operating our business.  We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.  We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level    13      Table of Contents   and, monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.  Financial and Economic Risks:  Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 40% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2022, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:    •  Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;        •  Customer and vendor financial stability;        •  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;        •  Changes in a specific country’s or region’s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;        •  Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;        •  Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;        •  Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;        •  Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;        •  Differing labor regulations;        •  Failure to comply with complex and rapidly changing government economic sanctions measures against other countries, especially arising from responses to armed conflict;        •  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;        •  Uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly known as “Brexit”; and        •  Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic.      To date the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions and our decision to halt all activities in the affected areas has had an immaterial impact on revenues.    14      Table of Contents   Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.   As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.  Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.  We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.  We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made.  Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.  If we are unable to successfully comply with our credit agreement with Bank of America or secure alternative financing, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Our credit agreement with Bank of America requires us, among other things, to satisfy certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis, consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We are also required to comply with other covenants and conditions, set forth in the credit agreement, including, among others, limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to repurchase or    15      Table of Contents   acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set forth in the credit agreement. If we were to violate the terms of the credit agreement and we were unable to renegotiate its terms at that time or secure alternative financing, it could have a material adverse impact on us.  The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:    •  Incur future indebtedness;        •  Place liens on assets;        •  Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock;        •  Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;        •  Conduct mergers or acquisitions;        •  Sell assets; and/or        •  Alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.      We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:    •  We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;        •  All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;        •  Management’s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;        •  Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;        •  Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;        •  Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and        •  Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.      In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.    16      Table of Contents   We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:    •  Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;        •  Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and        •  Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.      All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.  At the end of fiscal 2022, we had approximately $5.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.  To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter-parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.  Inadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.  In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.  We record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due to increased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could further increase our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.    17      Table of Contents   Legal and Regulatory Risks:  Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.  In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  We are subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under those environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Certain of our products contain, and some of manufacturing operations use various substances which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. Thus, we have and will continue to generate a generally limited amounts of hazardous wastes in our operations. We manage our compliance with laws and regulations and the proper mitigation of risks internally and through the input or external consultants and outside service providers and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We desire to reduce and ultimately eliminate any adverse environmental impact of our business and to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We expect this effort to affect our ongoing operations and require additional capital and operating expenditures. If we were to fail to manage our environmental compliance effectively, we could suffer economic or reputational harm.  As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, and have implemented new policies and procedures to reduce infection risk in our operations. These initiatives have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and all administrative and office-based functions.  Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption    18      Table of Contents   to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.  We collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations.  We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.  Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. All these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.  While we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct.  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as    19      Table of Contents   revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition"
10,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2021-04-13,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Business and Industry Risks  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business has been and will likely continue to be materially adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We operate in several regions of the world, with the largest concentration of team members in North America and Europe, and a small presence in Asia. We, and many other businesses and other organizations with which we do business directly or which otherwise impact us, have taken and are continuing to take steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting business travel and staying home from work when recommended by the public health authorities. These measures have disrupted and continue to disrupt our normal business operations both inside and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on our business, the businesses of our suppliers and customers, and on businesses and financial markets worldwide. Until vaccine availability and inoculation rates reach the point where public health authorities determine that the quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures that national, state and local governments have implemented as a result of the pandemic are no longer necessary, we expect our business to be negatively impacted.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have established new procedures to monitor government recommendations and regulations and made good faith efforts to comply with those regulations and the best practices recommendations issued by a variety of governmental health authorities and manufacturing industry organizations to which we belong. In addition, we have made significant modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including requiring most non-production related team members to work remotely, at least part-time. At this time, we expect that these measures will continue to remain in place for the near term, and we do not know when or if it will become practical to relax or eliminate these measures altogether. Since the start of the pandemic, we have maintained most of manufacturing operational capacity at our facilities located in West Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as our manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany. However, there were periods when a number of team members were unable to keep work schedules due to the effects of the pandemic, which resulted in reduced production capacity that led to longer order fulfillment lead times and as a result, reduced revenues. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact our manufacturing production will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and any associated variants, the efficacy and timing of distribution of vaccines, and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We also do not yet know to what extent our operations will be impacted permanently by remote work, increased safety protocols and the other adaptations undertaken during the pandemic.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for our products. We have been able to recover from these difficulties, but we have had to incur some additional costs in expedited and express shipping fees. These difficulties have impacted our efficiency and our ability to satisfy customer requirements, but we do not believe that they have materially impacted our financial results or our relationships with our customers. We are currently monitoring the world-wide delays in transit time, as freight carriers are now experiencing significant delays in overseas shipments. We are addressing these issues through long range planning and supplementing inventories as needed. We are also monitoring the extended lead times on active electronic components and utilizing several strategies, including blanket orders,    8    Table of Contents   vendor-bonded inventories, and extended commitments to our supply base. Additionally, we have taken actions to maintain regular contact with our important vendors and have increased our forecasting horizon for our products to help us better manage our supply chain. Our strategies to counteract the impact of the pandemic have tended to increase the amount of inventory we maintain, but because of the complexity of our supply chain and update our mitigation strategies as we determine to be appropriate. We will continue to monitor our supply chain a priority going forward. We are not able to predict what the full impact of the current supply chain difficulties, as it depends on how the course of the COVID-19 pandemic continues and its impacts on the economy evolve.  The aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has also been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both inside and outside of the United States. The decline in air travel has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial results, the ultimate scope of which we cannot estimate at this time. Should one or more of our airplane OEM manufacturing customers or a significant number of airline customers fail to continue business as a going concern, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise permanently reduce the demand for our products as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.  While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full scope of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, in the long run we expect that the lasting presence of COVID-19, will continue to adversely impact our operational capacity and the efficiency of our team members and will continue to negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition for the near term.  Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Any decline in our customers’ markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the 2020 grounding, suspension and subsequent slow restart of production of the Boeing 737 MAX has reduced demand for our airborne printers that are installed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies, which has negatively affected our results of operations. In addition, the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the airline industry as a whole, which could result in a reduction in orders by the airlines for new planes and reduce demand for retrofitting airplanes already in service and, therefore, a further reduction in demand for our airborne printer products. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future action relating to the 737 MAX on our business is currently unknown, but we expect any resulting reductions in production schedules will likely have an adverse effect on our business, which could be material. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers’ markets decline enough to impact their financial capacity, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by evolving technologies which in turn effect our product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our acquisition and data recorder products. Failure to meet our customers’ changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.    9      Table of Contents   As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or our plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.  Operational and Business Strategy Risks:  We are dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:    •  Disruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;        •  Limited control over the manufacturing process;        •  Potential absence of adequate production capacity;        •  Potential delays in production lead times;        •  Unavailability of certain process technologies; and        •  Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.      If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply, increase in the cost of the products manufactured by a third party subcontractor or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembled products and supplies, we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the continued global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been and likely will continue to be disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these    10      Table of Contents   components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  We face significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure.   Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time, we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.  We rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that we currently own. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.    11      Table of Contents   We have significant inventories on hand.  We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as continued reduced demand for our products if the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  We have incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.  In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes we employ, and may have unknown or undetected defects. Some types of defects may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause us to incur significant warranty, repair or re-engineering costs. As such, it could also divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts which may result in increased costs and lower profitability.  We could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  We employ information technology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other confidential information. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstance our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  We could experience disruptions related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.  We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all our operations to one global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The ERP system is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, improve the efficiency of how we accurately maintain our books and records and enhance the speed and quality of information provided to our management team for use in the operation and management of our business. The implementation of the ERP system will continue to require significant    12      Table of Contents   investment of human and financial resources. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have and will continue to experience delays and increased costs as a result of factors such as limited on-site availability of Company personnel and outside consultants due to travel restrictions and remote work conditions. The significant disruption in the implementation and transition to the new ERP system as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could delay or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain the benefits that the new ERP system is intended to provide. Additionally, while we have taken steps to ensure that we prevent adverse developments, any significant disruption or deficiency in the design, implementation and transition to the new ERP system could negatively impact our ability to:    •  record and process orders,        •  manufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, and        •  process data and electronic communications among our business locations,      any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems while we implement the new ERP system. Although we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant unforeseen implementation issues may arise that could impact our normal business operations and have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow.  We depend on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.  Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain, through competitive compensation and benefits programs, professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel as well as our ability to manage human capital resources. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we must maintain competitive compensation and benefits and we may also be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, several key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues. The loss of any of these employees as the result of competitive compensation pressures or ineffective management of human capital resources could harm our ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.  We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. We monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.    13      Table of Contents   Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.  Financial and Economic Risks:  Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 40% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:    •  Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;        •  Customer and vendor financial stability;        •  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;        •  Changes in a specific country’s or region’s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;        •  Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;        •  Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;        •  Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;        •  Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;        •  Differing labor regulations;        •  Differing protection of intellectual property;        •  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;        •  Uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly known as “Brexit”; and        •  Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic.      Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.   As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, including the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.    14      Table of Contents   The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax law and included a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certain business deductions, the acceleration of first-year expensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we continue to evaluate the actual impact of its enactment on the Company. Any material adverse impact resulting from the Tax Act that has not yet been identified could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries. On October 5, 2015, the OECD issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Many of these recommendations or similar concepts are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.  Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period.  In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.  We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.  We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made.  Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.    15      Table of Contents   If we are unable to successfully comply with our credit agreement with Bank of America or secure alternative financing, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Our credit agreement with Bank of America requires us, among other things, to satisfy certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis, consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We are also required to comply with other covenants and conditions, set forth in the credit agreement, including, among others, limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to repurchase or acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set forth in the credit agreement. If we were to violate the terms of the credit agreement and we were unable to renegotiate its terms at that time or secure alternative financing, it could have a material adverse impact on us.  The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:    •  Incur future indebtedness;        •  Place liens on assets;        •  Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock;        •  Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;        •  Conduct mergers or acquisitions;        •  Sell assets; and/or        •  Alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.      In addition, the agreement governing our credit facility permits us to elect to pay interest on our term loan and revolving line of credit based on LIBOR or an alternative rate as specified in the agreement. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the preferred alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR (“USD-LIBOR”). Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement. Our credit facility provides for the transition to a SOFR-based alternative benchmark at such time that LIBOR rates are no longer available. We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur. Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases,    16      Table of Contents   products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:    •  We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;        •  All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;        •  Management’s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;        •  Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;        •  Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;        •  Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and        •  Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.      In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:    •  Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;        •  Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and        •  Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.      All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.  At the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately $11.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.  To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter-parties to our    17      Table of Contents   financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.  Inadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.  In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.  We record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due to increased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could further increase our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.  Legal and Regulatory Risks:  Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.  In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  We are subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially    18      Table of Contents   and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.  As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, to implement a number of policies and procedures that have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and all administrative and office-based functions.  Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.  We collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations.  We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.  Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.  While we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and    19      Table of Contents   data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct.  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition"
14,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2020-04-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact onour business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertaintiesnot presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could be materially adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. COVID-19 has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic and has spread to many of the countries in which we, our customers, oursuppliers and our other business partners do business. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures,cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal businessoperations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.  We continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak,including requiring most non-production related team members to work remotely. We have maintained a substantial portion of our manufacturing operational capacity at our manufacturing facilities located in WestWarwick, Rhode Island, as well as our manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany, at this time, and we have instituted heightened cleaning and sanitization standards and several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard our teammembers.  However, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to experience a numberof adverse impacts, including reductions in demand for its products, delays and cancellations of orders for its products, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for its products, shortages of labor to manufacture products,inefficiencies caused by remote workers difficulties in performing their normal work outputs, closures of the facilities of some of its suppliers and customers, and delays in collecting accounts receivable. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the entirety of the impact that COVID-19 willhave on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, we expect that the continued spread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the governments of affected countries, actions taken to protectemployees, and the impact of the pandemic on all business activities to further adversely impact our operational capacity and the efficiency of our team members and will materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may alsoadversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity.   7 Table of ContentsThe aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has beensignificantly disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, both inside and outside of the United States. The impact of the decline in air travel will likely have a material adverse impact on the Companysfinancial results, the scope of which cannot be estimated at this time. Should one of more of our airplane OEM manufacturing customers or a significant number of airline customers fail to continue business as a going concern or declare bankruptcy,or otherwise reduce the demand for our products as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, it would have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. AstroNovas operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow asanticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result ina reduction in demand for our products. For example, the current grounding and suspension of production of the Boeing 737 MAX has reduced demand for our airborne printers that are placed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies,and that has negatively affected our results of operations. In addition, the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the airline industry as a whole, which could result in a reduction inorders by the airlines for new planes and reduce demand for retrofitting airplanes already in service and, therefore, a further reduction in demand for our airborne printer products. The effect of the COVID-19pandemic and any future action relating to the 737 MAX on our business is currently unknown, but we expect any resulting changes in production schedules will likely have an adverse effect on our business, which could be material. Some of ourcustomers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with noprovisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows andcould limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  AstroNovas future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop andintroduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our futuresuccess depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace withtechnological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate ourcompetitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as ourdata recorder products. Failure to meet our customers changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimizedisruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle ofour existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products.Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product coststructures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNovas plans for future support of existingproducts may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.   8 Table of ContentsAstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If thesemanufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Wesubcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:     Disruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak;     Limited control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in requiredvolumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely orcost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business,operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembled products and supplies, AstroNova is dependent upon singleor limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single sourceor limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, ourability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there has been and likely will continue to be disruptionto our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adverselyaffected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplierbecomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternativesources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source supplierscould have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  AstroNova faces significantcompetition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technologicaladvances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology,performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we  9 Table of Contentscurrently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adverselyaffect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seekalternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  AstroNovas profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time we alsoengage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could bematerially adversely affected.  AstroNovas inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend againstassertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.  We rely onpatents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to theCompanys proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that the Company currently owns. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss ofthe licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcementpractices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets couldhave an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divertour managements focus away from operations.  AstroNova has significant inventories on hand. We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, anysignificant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as prolonged reduced demand for the Companys products due to the COVID-19 outbreak, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNovas results of operations and financial position. Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue frominternational operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers   10 Table of Contentsoutside the U.S., accounted for 37% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. Inaddition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:     Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the currentCOVID-19 outbreak.  Brexit The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 and has entered a transition period until December 31, 2020. During thetransition period, the U.K. and the E.U. will seek to negotiate a trade deal, and the U.K. will remain in both the E.U. customs union and single market. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currencyexchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which mayadversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations. Brexit could subject us to disruptions in trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the UK, increased foreign exchange volatility withrespect to the British pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners.  AstroNova could incurliabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  AstroNova has incurredand could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by current or potential customers. These defects couldresult in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incursubstantial expenses to correct any product defects.  In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in thefuture assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes we employ, and may have unknown or undetectederrors. Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause   11 Table of ContentsAstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs and may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product developmentefforts which may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability.  Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business. In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for ourproducts by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Changes in our tax rates or exposure toadditional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rateis based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, includingchanges in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of ouruncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, including the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantlydifferent from previous periods or our current expectations.  The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. federal corporateincome tax law and includes a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certain business deductions, the acceleration of first-yearexpensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we continue to evaluate the actual impact of its enactment on the Company. Any material adverse impact resulting from the Tax Act that has not yet been identified could have an adverse effect onour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  Further changes in the tax laws of foreignjurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries. On October 5, 2015, theOECD issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Many of these recommendations or similar concepts are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in thesecountries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow infuture years.  Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations andinterpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have amaterial impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially differentfrom period-to-period.  In addition, theamount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our taxliabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income asfurther described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.   12 Table of ContentsWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income taxexpense, net income and cash flow.  We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreignjurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are manytransactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations andlegislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, netloss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of January 31, 2020, we did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.  Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets andliabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowancerequirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuationallowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years. The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any futuredebt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:     Incur future indebtedness;      Place liens on assets;      Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries capital stock;     Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;      Conduct mergers or acquisitions;      Sell assets; and/or      Alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepaysubordinated indebtedness.  Our credit agreement with Bank of America also requires us to satisfy otherrequirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and specifically because of the decline in revenue caused by the demand foraircraft cockpit printers for the 737 MAX, the anticipated decline in revenue due to the demand for aircraft due to the current COVID-19 pandemic driven decline in revenue passenger miles, as well as thelikely decline in demand for some of our PI and other T&M products as a result of the COVID-19 driven slowdown in general economic activity. At this time, we expect that it is likely that we will violatethe current terms of our credit agreement with Bank of America at the end of our first or second quarter of fiscal year 2021. While we expect to be able to renegotiate the terms of the credit agreement, if we are unable to do so or to securealternative financing on acceptable terms, it will have a material adverse impact on us. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely  13 Table of Contentsaffected. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. To the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth,profitability and competitiveness of our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the agreement governing our credit facility permits us to elect to pay interest on our revolving line of credit based onLIBOR or a base rate as specified in the agreement. We also have term loans under our credit facility, as well as derivative instruments with variable interest rates, that are indexed to LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, theauthority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed the Secured Overnight FinancingRate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR (USD-LIBOR) for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transitionplan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on an industry wide and/or company specific transition from LIBOR to an alternative that will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark ratesor financing costs to borrowers. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these changes cause the interest rates onour borrowings to increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  AstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses maynegatively impact AstroNovas overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, productsand technologies. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitableacquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or otheraspects of our business;      Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;     Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that wewill properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures willlikely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on variousfactors, including our ability to:      Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;   14 Table of Contents   Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures orstrategic partnerships, AstroNovas business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Adverseconditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks. At the end of fiscal 2020, we had approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held ina mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak may, in some cases, result in aninability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalentpositions and, in turn, our financial position.  To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to makeinvestments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets,the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, andfund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. AstroNova could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business andadversely affect our results of operations.  We employ information technology systems to support our business. Anysecurity breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic proprietary or confidential informationregarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other confidential information. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there isno assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackersor breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstance our system redundancy and otherdisaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a materialimpact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operatingresults and financial condition.   15 Table of ContentsAstroNova could experience risks related to the implementation of our new global enterpriseresource planning system.  We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all our operations to oneglobal enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The ERP system is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, improve the efficiency of how we accurately maintain our books and recordsand enhance the speed and quality of information provided to our management team for use in the operation and management of our business. The implementation of the ERP system will continue to require significant investment of human and financialresources. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will experience delays and increased costs as factors such as limited on-site availability of Company personnel andoutside consultants due to travel restrictions and remote work conditions, as well as a redirection of personnel efforts toward responding to the COVID-19 outbreak from the implementation of the new ERPsystem. Significant disruption in the implementation and transition to the new ERP system as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could negatively impact our ability to obtain the benefits that the new ERP systemis intended to bring. The length of these delays and the related cost are unknown because of the uncertainty of the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Additionally, any significant disruption ordeficiency in the design, implementation and transition to the new ERP system could negatively impact our ability to:      record and process orders,      manufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, and     process data and electronic communications among our business locations,  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significantimplementation issues may arise that impact our normal business operations and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow.  AstroNova depends on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employeescould compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.  Our future success depends upon our ability toattract and retain professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivatequalified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which woulddecrease net income. Additionally, a number of key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues and the loss of any of these employees could harmthe companys ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations.  AstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations couldharm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules,regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modifyour products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in ourproducts. If we do not   16 Table of Contentscomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantialcompliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state,local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal ofsolid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which havebeen or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Theselaws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.  As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S.jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, to implement a number of policies and procedures that have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and alladministrative and office-based functions.  Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign CorruptPractices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companiesand their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the worldthat have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be noassurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights andcompliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.  AstroNova collects andstores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or otherunauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulationsregarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations. We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, andinformation security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective inMay 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 , which was enacted in June 2018 andcame into effect   17 Table of Contentson January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumersabout their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.  Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored withinthose jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the Company and its subsidiaries. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirementsimpose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.  While we continue to assess these requirements and the waysthey may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we haveviolated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codesof conduct.  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store suchinformation) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions,significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions ofour various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairmentmay exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. Wemonitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit orasset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition ofsignificant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  We also reviewour long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider, whether as result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the 737 MAX grounding or otherwise, include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trendsand our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Suchcharges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.  Inadequate self-insuranceaccruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.  In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs.We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.   18 Table of ContentsWe record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as ofeach balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances.It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to recordadditional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe, that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due toincreased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could furtherincrease our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions,estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business,such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates andjudgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costsand results of operations could be materially harmed.  SEC rules require disclosuresregarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determinedthat we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which is considered a conflict mineral under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required toconduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying withthese disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that maybe necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligenceprocedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to doso. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed"
0,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2019-04-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact onour business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertaintiesnot presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.   6 Table of ContentsAstroNovas operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets intowhich we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or intheir general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. Although we have continued to experience measured progress, as sales have increased steadily from prior years, we are still affected by the continuedglobal economic uncertainty. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantitiesnecessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results ofoperations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  AstroNovas futurerevenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our futuresuccess depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace withtechnological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate ourcompetitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as ourTest and Measurement data recorder products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption incustomers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existingproducts, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally,when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, andmanage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNovas plans for future support of existing products maycause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. AstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volumeor quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of ourproducts to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:      Limited control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.   7 Table of ContentsIf one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue tomanufacture these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may notbe available, or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standardscould have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembledproducts and supplies, AstroNova is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products andsupplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or solesupplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also beadversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited sourcesupplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components.Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited sourcesuppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  AstroNova faces significantcompetition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become moreefficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success infuture performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products withfeatures that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully,we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  AstroNovas profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.   8 Table of ContentsWe are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our coststructure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If weare unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. AstroNova has significant inventories on hand.  We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or marketconditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNovas results ofoperations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associatedwith doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for 39% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2019, and we anticipate thatinternational sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financialcondition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  AstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  AstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testingor testing by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. Wecould be subject to material claims by customers, and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.   9 Table of ContentsIn addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume,liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes used by us, and may have known or undetected errors. Some typesof errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause AstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs, may divert the attention ofengineering personnel from product development efforts, and may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability. Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certificationscould negatively impact our business.  In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft,we must obtain certifications for our products by regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Changes in our taxrates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA or Tax Act) was signed into law. The Tax Actsignificantly revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax law and includes a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certainbusiness deductions, the acceleration of first-year expensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings offoreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we continue to evaluate the actual impact of its enactment on the Company. Any material adverse impact resulting from the Tax Act that has notyet been identified could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to theTax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates ofour effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period.  In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, ourfuture results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions(including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements. The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The agreement governing our current credit facility contains, and any future debt agreements may include, a number ofrestrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:     Incur future indebtedness;      Place liens on assets;      Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries capital stock;     Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;      Conduct mergers or acquisitions;   10 Table of Contents   Sell assets; and/or      Alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepaysubordinated indebtedness.  Such agreements also require us to satisfy other requirements, includingmaintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in defaultunder our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. To the extent that we are unable to engage in activities thatsupport the growth, profitability and competitiveness of our business, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  AstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses maynegatively impact AstroNovas overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, productsand technologies, including our September 2017 Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. and our February 2017 acquisition of the digital color label press and specialty printing systems business of the Danish company,TrojanLabel. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitableacquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or otheraspects of our business;      Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;     Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time.Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestituredepends on various factors, including our ability to:      Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;     Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.   11 Table of ContentsIf we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products,technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, AstroNovas business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access tocapital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.  At the end of fiscal 2019, we hadapproximately $7.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases,result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cashequivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.  To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed usto make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capitalmarkets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fundoperations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. AstroNova could experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of our information technology system which could harm our businessand adversely affect our results of operations.  We employ information technology systems to support our business. Anysecurity breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support avariety of business processes and activities. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches. As a result, ourinformation technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systemsfailures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstance our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continueto experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws,disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  AstroNova could experience risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.  We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all of our operations to one global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency ofour supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to requiresignificant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design, implementation and transition to the newERP could negatively impact our ability to:      record and process orders,   12 Table of Contents   manufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, and     process data and electronic communications among our business locations,  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significantimplementation issues may arise that impact our normal business operations and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow.  AstroNova depends on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employeescould compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.  Our future success depends upon our ability toattract and retain professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivatequalified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, whichwould decrease net income. Additionally, a number of key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues and the loss of any of these employeescould harm the companys ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, and results of operations.  AstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws andregulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject tolaws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in theneed to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain othersubstances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating toprotection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and governthe cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous.As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations andrequire capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.  Our operations are subject toanti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generallyprohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government   13 Table of Contentsofficials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that haveexperienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance thatour internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights andcompliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.  AstroNova collects andstores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or otherunauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous laws in the countries in which we operate regarding privacy and thestorage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws of this nature are adopted from time totime. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companiesprocessing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Additionally, certain developing countries in which we do business are also considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulationsand legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are often pending before the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures.  While we believe that we comply with industry standards and applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection in all material respects, there is no assurance that wewill not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom wehave contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result ingovernmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential usersand the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.  We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unitlevel and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. We monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changesthat would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of ourbusiness as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a materialadverse impact on our results of operations.  We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, andother intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future  14 Table of Contentsoperating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge toearnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters couldsignificantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles andrelated accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories,business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.  Compliancewith rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed. SEC rules require disclosures regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo andadjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which is considered a conflict mineral under theSEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our productsoriginated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of anyconflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may be necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturersfor some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers whorequire that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Due to the fact that we have operations located within the United Kingdom (UK), our business and financial results may be negativelyimpacted as a result of the UKs planned exit from the European Union (EU). These risks would be heightened in the event that the UK and the EU are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory exit agreement. On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to asBrexit. On March 29, 2017, the UK Government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union, which is expected to result in the UK exiting the EU. The UK Government continues to negotiate the terms of the UKs futurerelationship with the EU, although there is still considerable uncertainty as to the outcome. It is possible that following agreement, the new relationship will result in greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries,as well as the US. and increased regulatory complexity. There is also the potential for disruption to the movement of raw materials and finished goods in the event that no agreement is reached by the planned exit date. These changes may adverselyaffect our operations and financial results.  Additionally, following the referendum on Brexit, the value of the British pound(GBP) incurred significant fluctuations. If the value of the British Pound Sterling continues to incur similar fluctuations, unfavorable exchange rate changes may negatively affect the value of our operations located in the UK, as translated toour   15 Table of Contentsreporting currency, the USD, in accordance with US GAAP, which may impact the revenue and earnings we report. Continued fluctuations in the GBP may also result in the imposition of priceadjustments by EU-based suppliers to our UK operations, as those suppliers seek to compensate for the changes in value of the GBP as compared to the Euro. In addition, aso-called Hard Brexit, where no formal agreement is made between the EU and the UK prior to the UKs exit, could result in a continued deflation of the British Pound Sterling; additionalincreases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs applicable to goods that are bought and sold between the UK and EU, and a negative impact on end markets in the UK as a result of declines in consumer sentiment or decreased immigration rates into the UK.Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
7,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2018-04-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact onour business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertaintiesnot presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  AstroNovasoperating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have continued to experiencemeasured progress, as sales have increased steadily from prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of thesepurchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, wemay not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable. AstroNovas future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achievemarket acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidlychanging technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, productenhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from ourcompetitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effortrelated to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our Test and Measurement data recorder products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect ourfuture revenue growth and operating results.  As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage thetransition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new orenhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existingproducts in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsoleteinventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products orAstroNovas plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.   7 Table of ContentsAstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If thesemanufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Wesubcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:     Limited control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes orfails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timelyor cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembled products and supplies, AstroNova is dependentupon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single sourceor limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, ourability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficientquantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components,assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible ona timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results andfinancial condition.  AstroNova faces significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven byrapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete onthe basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currentlyserve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we mustdevelop new products, services and applications and periodically   8 Table of Contentsenhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial position.  AstroNovas profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequatepricing for our products and to control our cost structure.  Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequatepricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricingactions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products andservices, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We are continuallyreviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engagein restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  AstroNova has significant inventories on hand. We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, anysignificant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact our business, operating results andfinancial condition.  Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affectAstroNovas results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business issubject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for 38% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2018, and weanticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results andfinancial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;     9 Table of Contents   Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  AstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  AstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite testing internally orby current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could besubject to material claims by customers, and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.  In addition,through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality controlprocesses used by us, and may have known or undetected errors. Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause AstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs, may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resultingin increased costs and lower profitability.  Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations,and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.  In certain industriesand for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain suchcertifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional taxpayments for prior periods.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA or TaxAct) was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax law and includes a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income taxrate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certain business deductions, the acceleration of first-year expensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have not yet issued regulations with respect to the Tax Act.  Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, thesubjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of the effective tax rate and deferred tax assets andliabilities. For example, our estimate of the net one-time charge we have incurred related to the Tax Act could differ materially from our actual liability, due to, among other things, further refinement ofour calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. The impact of the factors referencedin the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period.  In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, ourfuture results may include   10 Table of Contentsunfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in otherjurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.  The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The agreement governing our current credit facility contains, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictivecovenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:      Incur future indebtedness;      Place liens on assets;      Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries capital stock;     Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;      Conduct mergers or acquisitions;      Sell assets; and/or      Alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepaysubordinated indebtedness.  Such agreements also require us to satisfy other requirements, includingmaintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in defaultunder our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. To the extent that we are unable to engage in activities thatsupport the growth, profitability and competitiveness of our business, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  AstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses maynegatively impact AstroNovas overall business.  We have made strategic investments in other companies, productsand technologies, including our September 2017 Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc.; our February 2017 acquisition of the digital color label press and specialty printing systems business of the Danish company,TrojanLabel and the June 2015 acquisition of the aerospace printer business from RITEC. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However,there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative effect on operating results or otheraspects of our business;      Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financial condition;     Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.   11 Table of ContentsIn certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions maybe consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in aparticular acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divestcertain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customerrelationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:      Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;     Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures orstrategic partnerships, AstroNovas business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair our liquidity. At the end of fiscal 2018, we had approximately $11.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments held for sale. Our cash andcash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds thattraditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position. Ourinvestment portfolio consists of state and municipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date; however, defaults by the issuers of any of these securities may result in anadverse impact on our portfolio.  AstroNova could experience disruptions in, or breach in security of our information technology systemor fail to implement new systems or software successfully which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  We employ information technology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise ourinformation and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which aremanaged by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is noassurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches and our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these typesof threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any   12 Table of Contentssuch events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys brand and reputation, which couldadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  AstroNova depends on our key employees and other highlyqualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professional and executive employees, including sales, operating,marketing, and financial management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and future prospects. In order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, a number of key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplierrelationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues and the loss of any of these employees could harm the companys ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills arereplaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  AstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements ineach of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact onour future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject tocosts and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental,health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge ofpollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in ourproducts and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by complianceobligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that theCompany or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments togovernment officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to somedegree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local   13 Table of Contentscustoms and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal actscommitted by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Unauthorized access of personal data could give rise toliabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly. AstroNova collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personalinformation that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claimsagainst us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous laws in the countries in which we operate regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which arechanging, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws of this nature are adopted from time to time. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, acomprehensive privacy and data protection reform that becomes enforceable in May 2018. At the same time, certain developing countries in which we do business are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulationsand legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are often pending before the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures.  While we believe that we comply with industry standards and applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection in all material respects, there is no assurance that wewill not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.  Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom wehave contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result ingovernmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential usersand the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results ofoperations.  We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes incircumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates,cash flows and discount rates. We monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance andcash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions,may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters couldsignificantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  Generally accepted accounting principles andrelated accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as   14 Table of Contentsrevenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involvemany subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financialcondition.  Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain productcomponents and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed.  SEC rules require disclosures regardingthe use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we usegold, tin and tantalum, each of which is considered a conflict mineral under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conductinquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with thesedisclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may benecessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligenceprocedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to doso. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  The decision by British voters to exit theEuropean Union may negatively impact our operations.  In June 2016 the United Kingdom held a referendum in which theBritish voted in favor of exiting the European Union. This referendum has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Althoughit is unknown what the full terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including theUnited States, and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements"
18,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2017-04-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.As a result of   6 Table of Contentsthe risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, orthat we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  AstroNovas operating results and financialcondition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.  Anydecline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have continued to experience measured progress, as sales have increased steadilyfrom prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers mayalso limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due tous. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  AstroNovas future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introductioncycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keepingpace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipateour competitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well asour Test and Measurement data recorder products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption incustomers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existingproducts, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally,when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, andmanage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNovas plans for future support of existing products maycause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. AstroNova faces significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance,price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we  7 Table of Contentscurrently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect thecompetitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and importantcustomers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. AstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volumeor quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of ourproducts to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:      Limited control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes orfails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timelyor cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition.  For certain components, assembled products and consumables, AstroNova is dependentupon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and consumables used in the manufacture of our products from a singlesource or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain consumables were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or assembledproducts, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtainsufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply thesecomponents, assembled products or consumables in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may notbe feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and consumables provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business,operating results and financial condition.  Any future action by the U.S. Congress lowering the federal corporate income tax rate,and/or limiting deductions and credits, and/or eliminating the federal corporate alternative minimum tax could result in the reduction of our deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge against earnings. The net deferred tax asset reported on our balance sheet represents the net amount of income taxes expected to be received upon thereversal of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities as measured   8 Table of Contentsby enacted tax laws, and their bases as reported in the financial statements. As of January 31, 2017, the Companys net deferred tax asset was computed using the federal statutory rateof 34%.  The President of the United States and members of Congress have announced plans to lower the federal corporate incometax rate from its current level of 35% and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. If these plans ultimately result in the enactment of new laws lowering the corporate income tax rate and/or eliminating the corporate alternativeminimum tax, our net deferred tax asset would be re-measured resulting in a reduction of the deferred tax asset in the period of the law change and a corresponding charge against earnings.  The decision by British voters to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations.  The June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (Brexit) adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as comparedto the U.S. dollar and other currencies. As the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union, volatility in exchange rates and in U.K. interest rates may continue. In the near term, a weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during areporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars; a weaker British pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease theprofitability of our U.K. operations; and a higher U.K. interest rate may have a dampening effect on the U.K. economy. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade,regulatory and other negotiations.  AstroNova has significant inventories on hand. We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, anysignificant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact our business, operating results andfinancial condition.  Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certainproduct components and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed.  SEC rules require disclosuresregarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determinedthat we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which are considered conflict minerals under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required toconduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying withthese disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that maybe necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligenceprocedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to doso. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  Economic, political and other risksassociated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNovas results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirectsales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2017, and we anticipate   9 Table of Contentsthat international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S.Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  AstroNovas profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If weare unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. AstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. AstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturingdefects. Our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve marketacceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.  In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the samelevel of product development, testing and quality control processes used by us, and may have known or undetected errors.   10 Table of ContentsSome types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause AstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs, maydivert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability. AstroNova could experience disruptions in, or breach in security of our information technology system or fail to implement new systems or softwaresuccessfully which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  We employ informationtechnology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us toliability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronicinformation, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We also collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject toprivacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or securitybreaches and our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utilityfailures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none ofthem to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys brand and reputation, which could adverselyaffect our business, operating results and financial condition.  AstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address orcomply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Ouroperations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies orrequirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability toinclude lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certificationscould negatively impact our business.  In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft,we must obtain certifications for our products by regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Our operations aresubject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generallyprohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance  11 Table of Contentswith these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance withanti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed bythose of our employees or agents who violate our policies.  Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, healthand safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge ofpollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in ourproducts and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by complianceobligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance. Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair ourliquidity.  At the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately $24.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investmentsheld for sale. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such asmoney market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, ourfinancial position. Our investment portfolio consists of state and municipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date; however, defaults by the issuers of any of thesesecurities may result in an adverse impact on our portfolio.  The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to variousrestrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  On February 28, 2017, we entered into asecured credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as lender, pursuant to which we borrowed a term loan in the amount of $9.2 million and established a $10.0 million revolving line of credit. All amounts borrowed pursuant to the credit facility arerequired to be paid in full no later than January 31, 2022.  The agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us tovarious restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:      Incur future indebtedness;      Place liens on assets;      Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries capital stock;     Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;      Conduct mergers or acquisitions;      Sell assets; and/or      Alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepaysubordinated indebtedness.   12 Table of ContentsThese restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue businessopportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.  AstroNova may not realize the anticipatedbenefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact AstroNovas overall business. We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our June 2015 acquisition of the aerospaceprinter business from RITEC. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identifysuitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative effect on operating results or otheraspects of our business;      Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financial condition;     Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time.Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestituredepends on various factors, including our ability to:      Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;     Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures orstrategic partnerships, AstroNovas business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected"
17,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2016-04-08,"Risk Factors
  The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Astro-Med because suchfactors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-lookingstatements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Astro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our product decline or do not grow as anticipated. Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for ourproducts. For example, although we have continued to experience measured progress   6 Table of Contentsin fiscal 2016 and 2015, as sales have increased from prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty as some of our customers remain reluctant to make capitalequipment purchases or are deferring these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers are also limiting consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use.Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remainprofitable.  Astro-Meds future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on atimely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.

Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated couldadversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  As Astro-Med introduces new or enhanced products, we mustalso successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands.The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers todefer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manageexcess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling outnew products or Astro-Meds plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolvingindustry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance,price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional marketsegments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services andapplications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial position.   7 Table of ContentsAstro-Med is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers donot meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract themanufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:     Limited control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes orfails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves in as much as we own the designs, drawings, and bills of material for all our products.Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure ofa subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For certain components and assembled products, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meetdemand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and componentsfor our products where possible, we purchase certain components and assembled products used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component or assembled products were to bedelayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business,results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternativesource. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign ourproducts with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided bysingle or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costsand results of operations could be materially harmed.  SEC rules require disclosures regarding the use ofconflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we use gold, tinand tantalum, each of which are considered conflict minerals under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conduct inquiriesdesigned to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosurerequirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may be necessary asa consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures thatwe implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As aresult, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.   8 Table of ContentsEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adverselyaffect Astro-Meds results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, ourbusiness is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue forfiscal year 2016 and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  Astro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If weare unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Astro-Med has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturingdefects. Our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve marketacceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.   9 Table of ContentsIn addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume,liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been through the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes used by us, and may have known or undetected errors. Some types oferrors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause Astro-Med to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs, may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product developmentefforts, and may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability.  Astro-Med could experience disruptions in, or breach in security of our information technology system or fail to implement new systems or software successfully which could harm our business andadversely affect our results of operations.  Astro-Med employs information technology systems to support our business.During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Astro-Med completed the upgrade of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to the Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne platform. This new system went live in March 2015 for all of our U.S. operations. Anysecurity breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support avariety of business processes and activities. We also collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulationsand customer-imposed controls. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches and our information technologynetworks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, naturaldisasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a materialimpact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results andfinancial condition.  Astro-Med is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations couldharm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules,regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modifyour products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in ourproducts. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business. In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for ourproducts by regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.   10 Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments togovernment officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to somedegree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies andprocedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies. Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantialcompliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state,local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal ofsolid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which havebeen or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Theselaws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair our liquidity. At the end of fiscal 2016, we had approximately $20 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments held for sale. Our cash and cashequivalents are held in a mix of money market funds and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed ashighly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position. Our investment portfolio consists of state andmunicipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date; however, defaults by the issuers of any of these securities may result in an adverse impact on our portfolio. Astro-Med may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, andintegration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact Astro-Meds overall business. Astro-Med has acquired or made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our most recent acquisitionin June 2015 of the aerospace printer business from RITEC. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance thatwe will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;   11 Table of Contents   Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative effect on operating results or otheraspects of our business;      Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financial condition;     Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  Astro-Med may also divest certain businesses from time totime. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestituredepends on various factors, including our ability to:      Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;     Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If Astro-Med is not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions,divestitures or strategic partnerships, Astro-Meds business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected"
3,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2015-04-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   The following risk factors should be carefully considered inevaluating Astro-Med because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from thoseprojected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations. Astro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our product decline or do not grow asanticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result ina reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have continued to experience measured progress in fiscal 2015 and 2014, as sales have increased from prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty assome of our customers remain reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and are limiting consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions   6 Table of Contentsto stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations,financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  Astro-Meds future revenue growthdepends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidlychanging needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The successof our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors development of new products, and maintain high levels ofproduct quality and reliability. Astro-Med spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our Test and Measurement data recorder products. Failure to further developany of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  As Astro-Med introduces new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels ofolder product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products,thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerousrisks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the typeor complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or Astro-Meds plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competingproducts which would adversely affect our business and operating results.  Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure tocompete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  While we do maintain adominant position in our markets, we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient.Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in futureperformance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products withfeatures that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully,we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Astro-Med is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materiallyharmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to an independent third party atfacilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:      Loss of control over the manufacturing process;   7 Table of Contents   Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes orfails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves in as much as we own the designs, drawings, and bills of material for all our products.Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure ofa subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For certain components and assembled products, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meetdemand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and componentsfor our products where possible, we purchase certain components and assembled products used in the manufacture of our products from single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component or assembled products were to be delayedor curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, resultsof operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternativesource. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements orredesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled productsprovided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costsand results of operations could be materially harmed.  Beginning in 2014, SEC rules require new disclosures regardingthe use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. There are costs associated withcomplying with these disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services ofsupplies that may be necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products throughthe due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage ifwe are unable to do so. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  Economic, political andother risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect Astro-Meds results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirectsales to customers   8 Table of Contentsoutside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2015 and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of ourrevenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:     Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Changes in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  Astro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure.

As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from thoseprojected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations. Astro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our product decline or do not grow asanticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result ina reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have experienced measured progress in fiscal 2014 and 2013, as sales have increased from prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty as some of ourcustomers remain reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and are limiting consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers marketsdecline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding   6 Table of Contentsamounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable. Astro-Meds future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achievemarket acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidlychanging technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, productenhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from ourcompetitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. Astro-Med spends a significant amount of time and effortrelated to the development of our Rugged and Color Printer products as well as our Test and Measurement recorder products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our futurerevenue growth and operating results.  As Astro-Med introduces new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage thetransition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new orenhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existingproducts in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsoleteinventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products orAstro-Meds plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.  While we do maintain a dominant position in our markets, we operate in an environment ofsignificant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies torelatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to competesuccessfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of ourproducts. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitorswhich could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.  Astro-Med is dependent upon contractmanufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to an independent third party at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number ofsignificant risks, including:      Loss of control over the manufacturing process;   7 Table of Contents   Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes orfails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will take over the manufacturing ourselves in as much as we own the designs, drawings, and bills of material for all our products. Additionalqualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply of, or increase in the cost of, the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of asubcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For certain components and assembled products, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meetdemand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  Although we use standard parts and componentsfor our products where possible, we purchase certain components and assembled products used in the manufacture of our products from single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component or assembled products were to be delayedor curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, resultsof operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternativesource. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements orredesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled productsprovided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with new rules governing, conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and ourcosts and results of operations could be materially harmed.  In July 2010, the United States federal government enactedthe Dodd-Frank Act which contained provisions that mandated the creation of rules by the SEC for public companies to ascertain the region of origin of certain minerals, commonly known as conflict minerals, used in the production of goodsand if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country. It may be possible that conflict minerals may be part of the supply chain in our industry and contained in our products. In August 2012, the SECadopted a new rule requiring disclosures of conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The new rule, which went into effect for calendar year2013, requires a disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31, 2014 and will require us to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not our products contain such minerals and from which countries and source the minerals wereobtained. The new rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components used in Astro-Meds products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with thedisclosure requirements for conflict minerals, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes or sources of supplies as aconsequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that weimplement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As a result,our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.   8 Table of ContentsEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adverselyaffect Astro-Meds results of operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, ourbusiness is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue forfiscal year 2014 and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our futureresults could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Changes in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  Astro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If weare unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may havedefects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantialdamage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.   9 Table of ContentsIn addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed-and may in the future assumeliabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been through the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes used by us, and may have known or undetected errors. Some types oferrors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause Astro-Med to incur significant warranty and repair costs, may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and maycause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability. Astro-Med could experience disruptions in, or breach in security of, our information technology system or fail to implement new systems or softwaresuccessfully which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Astro-Med employsinformation technology systems to support our business, including the ongoing phased implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in fiscal 2014 and 2015 for all of our U.S. operations. Security breaches and other disruptions toour information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinarycourse of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities.Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations andcustomer-imposed controls. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches and our information technologynetworks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, naturaldisasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a materialimpact. There may be other challenges and risks as we upgrade and implement our new ERP system. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to theCompanys reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Astro-Med is subject tolaws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changesin laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply withnew regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adverselyimpacted.  Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments orimpair our liquidity.  At the end of fiscal 2014, we had approximately $27 million of cash, cash equivalents andinvestments held for sale. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money marketfunds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterpart financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.Our investment portfolio consists of state and municipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date; however, defaults by the issuers of any of these securities may resultin an adverse impact on our portfolio.   10 Table of ContentsAstro-Med may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures andstrategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact Astro-Meds overall business.  Astro-Med has, in the past, acquired or made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our most recent acquisition in January 2014 of the Ruggedized Printer Productline from Miltope. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitableacquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business;     Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financialcondition;      Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  Astro-Med may also divest certain businesses from time totime. On January 31, 2013, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Grass Technologies Product Group. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potentialloss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:     Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;     Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and     Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.  If Astro-Med is not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions,divestitures or strategic partnerships, Astro-Meds business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected"

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to beimmaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Depressed general economic conditions may adversely affect Astro-Meds resultsof operation and financial position.  Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both insideand outside the United States. An economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:      Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;     Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;      Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;     Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables;     Greater risk of impairment to the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio: and     Greater risk that cost reduction actions may be necessary resulting in restructuring charges   6 Table of ContentsAstro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into whichwe sell our product decline or do not grow as anticipated.

   The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Astro-Med because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.As a result of the   6 Table of Contentsrisk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or thatwe currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.  Depressed general economic conditions, financial marketdisruptions, and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect Astro-Meds results of operation and financial position.  Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. As widely reported, financial markets throughout the world have experienced extremedisruption since 2008, including historically high volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining value of others, failure of major financialinstitutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations. Recurrence of these developments and a related economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:     Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;     Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;      Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;     Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables;     Greater risk of impairment to the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio: and     Greater risk that cost reduction actions may be necessary resulting in restructuring charges Astro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our product decline or do not grow asanticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions, including declinesrelated to the market disruptions as described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have experienced measured progress in fiscal 2012 and 2011, as sales have increased from prior years, weare still affected by the continued global economic downturn as some of our customers remain reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and are limiting consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with noprovisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows andcould limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  Astro-Meds future revenue growth depends on our ability to introduce newproducts and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The marketsfor our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplyinghigh-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability todifferentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings; price our products competitively; anticipate our competitors development of new products; and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. Astro-Med spends asignificant amount of time and effort related to the development of our Ruggedized and Color Printer products as well as our Test and Measurement products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipatedcould adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure tocompete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Weoperate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient.  7 Table of ContentsOur competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distributionand customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors ornew market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existingofferings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Astro-Med is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either involume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  During fiscal 2012, we subcontracted the manufacturing andassembly of certain of our products to an independent third party at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:     Loss of control over the manufacturing process;      Potential absence of adequate production capacity;      Potential delays in production lead times;      Unavailability of certain process technologies; and      Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. If our significant subcontractor becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes, we will haveto identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will take over the manufacturing ourselves in as much as we own the designs, drawings, and bills of material for all our products. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or maynot be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply of, or increase in the cost of, the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating resultsand financial condition.  For certain components and assembled products, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers.If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  If the supplyof a key component or assembled products were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timelymanner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify andobtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes, we will have toidentify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase inthe cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect Astro-Meds results of operations and financial position. Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue frominternational operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012 and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for asignificant portion of our revenue. In addition, many of our   8 Table of Contentsemployees, suppliers, job functions and facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:     Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;     Customer and vendor financial stability;      Changes in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;     Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;     Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;     Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  Astro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure. Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to ourshareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient tooffset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materiallyadversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including butnot limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If weare unable to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adverselyaffected.  Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.Our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve marketacceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.  Astro-Med is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements ineach of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand  9 Table of Contentsfor our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with new regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain othersubstances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. A number of our products from our Grass Technologies product group are subject to regulation by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived potentially to have failed tocomply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities orthe imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers, and/or the inability to sell our products. Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair our liquidity. At the end of fiscal 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $11.7 million invested or held in a mixof money market funds and bank demand deposit accounts. The continued disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid.Any failure of our counterpart financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results of operations and financial position. As of January 31, 2012, we alsohad an approximate $11.3 million portfolio of securities available for sale. This portfolio consists of state and municipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date;however, failure of any of these securities may result in an adverse impact on our portfolio.  Astro-Med may not be able to effectivelyintegrate businesses or assets acquired.  We may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies andstrategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:     We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;     All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;     Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;     Amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business;     Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financialcondition;      Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks"

Under such circumstances, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Depressed general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect Astro-Meds results ofoperation and financial position.  Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside andoutside the U.S. Worldwide financial markets have experienced extreme disruption in the past few years which are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We are unable to predict how long the economic downturn will last or thestrength or duration of an economic recovery. A continuing and/or a return to an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:      Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;     Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;      Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;     Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables; and     Greater risk of impairment to the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio.

Thesedisruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We are unable to predict how long the economic downturn will last. Continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may adversely impact our businessresulting in:      Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;      Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;      Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;      Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables; and      Greater risk of impairment to the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio.  Astro-Meds operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our product decline or do not grow asanticipated.  Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions, including declinesrelated to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, we experienced weakness in all segments during the current fiscal year caused largely by the  7 Table of Contentscontinued global economic downturn as our customers are reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and are limiting consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediateneeds with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cashflows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.  Astro-Meds actions to reduce costs could have a long-termadverse effect on our business.  The continued decline and uncertainty in economic conditions has required us to takesteps to reduce our costs by implementing a Companywide cost reduction initiative which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and includes wage and salary freezes, layoffs and a general reduction in hours worked by the production staff.This cost reduction initiative will remain in effect until the Company determines otherwise. We can not, however, be certain that this initiative will achieve its intended results. It is also possible that the cost reduction initiative could havethe effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our abilityto increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances,evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete primarily on the basis oftechnology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and toexpand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop newproducts, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position.  Astro-Meds future revenue growth depends on our ability to introduce new products andservices on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.  The markets for ourproducts are characterized by rapidly changing technology and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplyinghigh-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards.

Astro-Med spends asignificant amount of time and effort related to the development of our Ruggedized and Color Printer products as well as our Test and Measurement products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipatedcould adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  Astro-Meds failure to successfully manage the transitionbetween our new products and our older products may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.  As Astro-Med introduces new or enhanced products, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruptions in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and providesufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. When Astro-Med  8 Table of Contentsintroduces new or enhanced products that feature higher-performance and new technological options, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accuratelyforecast demand, address new or higher product cost structures and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type of complexity of the new products. In addition, any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out newproducts or Astro-Meds plan for future support of existing products may negatively impact customer purchase decisions.  Forcertain components and assembled products, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  If the supply of a key component or assembled products were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or solevendor delays shipment of such components or completed products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also beadversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.  Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembledproducts in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis.Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect Astro-Meds resultsof operations and financial position.  Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risksassociated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2010 and weanticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, many of our employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could beharmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;      Customer and vendor financial stability;      Changes in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions political, economic or other conditions;      Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;      Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;      Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.   9 Table of ContentsAstro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for ourproducts and to improve our cost structure.  Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for ourproducts and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset theeffect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results ofoperations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We are continually reviewing our operations with aview towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010,management initiated a Company-wide cost reduction program in response to the continued depressed economic conditions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain our cost baseat or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from current cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  Astro-Meds results of operation may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.  Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demanddoes not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand,we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costsassociated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.  Third parties may infringe our intellectual propertyand we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.  Astro-Meds successdepends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish ourproprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our results of operation and financial position.  Our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. Wemay need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce ourintellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoidinfringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies.  Astro-Medcould incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.  Astro-Medcould incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among otherthings, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may need to incur substantialexpenses to correct any product defects.   10 Table of ContentsAstro-Med depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retainother key personnel.  Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of key management,sales, marketing, research and development and manufacturing personnel, many of whom we would have difficulty replacing. We believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineers andmanagement, sales and marketing personnel. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial position.  Astro-Med is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements ineach of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact onour future operating results. In addition, we must comply with new regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subjectto costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.  A number of our products from our Grass Technologiesproduct group are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicableregulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance; fines, injunctions and civilpenalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of ourcustomers, and/or the inability to sell our products. Astro-Med sells medical equipment to customers who rely on certain third partyreimbursement rates.  We cannot be certain that third party reimbursement rates and policies will continue in thefuture. Any change in reimbursement rates and policies could adversely impact our profitability.  Adverse conditions in the globalbanking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair our liquidity.  At theend of fiscal 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $14 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. The continued disruptions in the financial markets may, insome cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterpart financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact ourcash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results of operations and financial position. As of January 31, 2010, we also had an approximate $10 million portfolio of securities available for sale. This portfolio consists of state andmunicipal securities with various maturity dates as well as an auction rate security. All of the securities in the portfolio are triple AAA rated at original purchase date; however, a failure of the issuer of any such commercial paper may result inan adverse impact on the portfolio.   11 Table of ContentsAstro-Med may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets acquired. We may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology.However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In December 2009, we acquired Label Line Ltd. (Label Line), a manufacturer of labels and tags which has become part of our QuickLabel Systemsbrand. In any acquisition that we complete, including the recent acquisition of Label Line, we cannot be certain that:      We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;      All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;      Managements attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;      Amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business;     Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financialcondition;      Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation; and     Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.  In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtainingshareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be noassurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.  Business interruptions could adversely affect Astro-Medsbusiness.  Our operations and the operations of our suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers are vulnerable tointerruptions by fire, earthquake, hurricane, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism and other events beyond our control. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance forinterruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism. In the event that a material business interruption occurs that affects Astro-Med, its suppliers, contract manufacturers or customers, shipments could be delayed and our business and financialresults could be harmed. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in globalmarkets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater riskthat our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss"
13,ALOT,ASTRONOVA INC,2009-04-13,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The following risk factorsshould be carefully considered in evaluating Astro-Med because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results coulddiffer materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity andfinancial condition. If any such risks   6 Table of Contentsoccur, Astro-Meds business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under suchcircumstances, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  Declining general economicconditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect Astro-Meds results of operation and financial position.  Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Worldwide financial markets have experienced extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things,extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and declining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We areunable to predict how long the economic downturn will last. Continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may adversely impact our business resulting in:      Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;      Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;      Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;      Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables; and      Greater risk of impairment to the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio.  Astro-Med faces significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new productintroductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability,brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally,current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodicallyenhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Astro-Meds future revenue growth depends on our ability to introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of thesenew products and services.  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and accelerating productintroduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basisand by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. Astro-Med spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our Ruggedized and Color Printer products. Failure to further develop theseproducts and markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.  For certain components and assembledproducts, Astro-Med is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.  If the supply of a key component or assembled products were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delaysshipment of such components or completed products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of   7 Table of Contentsoperations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original sourceor, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.  Additionally, if any single or limited sourcesupplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternativesources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.  Economic, political and other risks associated withinternational sales and operations could adversely affect Astro-Meds results of operations and financial position.  Because wesell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted forapproximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2009 and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, many of our employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities arelocated outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:      Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;      Customer and vendor financial stability;      Changes in foreign currency exchange rates;      Changes in a specific countrys or regions political, economic or other conditions;      Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;      Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      Difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;      Differing labor regulations;      Differing protection of intellectual property;      Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and      Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  Astro-Meds profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure.  Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain forour products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/orcompetition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.  We continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, exitingcertain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. We from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at orbelow the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.   8 Table of ContentsAstro-Meds results of operation may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for ourproducts.  Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing marketconditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacityto meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturingcapacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.  Third parties may infringe ourintellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.  Astro-Medssuccess depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish ourproprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our results of operation and financial position.  Our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need tospend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectualproperty rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement bydesigning around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Most of our trademarks have no foreign protection since we have not registered them in foreign countries. Intellectual property rights and ourability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.  Astro-Med could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.
