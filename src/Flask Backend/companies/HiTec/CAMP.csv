6,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2023-04-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors that are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware. Among others, including those described in more detail below, these risks include:•We face several factors which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and effect our ability to continue as a going concern:oWe are not cash flow positive and may not have sufficient cash to fund our long term planned operations. As of February 28, 2023, we had $41.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $37.3 million from February 28, 2022.oWe may not be able to access additional funds under our asset-based revolving credit facility due, in part, to certain covenants regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio. 10Table of Contents oWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash, or repay the 2025 Convertible Notes at maturity or repurchase them upon a fundamental change oWe may not have the ability to raise the funds to pay our obligations under our 2025 Convertible Notes, or extend the maturity date of our 2025 Convertible Notes. Any adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, and any equity financing could affect our stock price and be materially dilutive to existing stockholders. •Our asset-based revolving credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, or make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt.•Component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico and other Pacific Rim countries.•The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and the continued effects of the pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.•Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and we generally do not have long-term contracts with customers, the loss or significant decline or slowdown of sales to these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.•Our operations are subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation. If the inflation rate continues to impact the costs of our labor and supplies, and the costs of our suppliers, it will adversely affect our operating expenses.•Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or will maintain or capture increased market share.•We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, and are at risk of future attacks, which could damage our reputation, vendor and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services.•If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.•If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines or if we fail to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards, our business could be adversely affected.•Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.•Our global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally. The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine may amplify or precipitate these risks and the other risks described herein.•Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.•Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.11Table of Contents •We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.•We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.•We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.•The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline. Risks Related to Our Cash Flow and Liquidity We are not cash flow positive and may not have sufficient cash to fund our long term planned operations, and we may not be able to access additional funds under our asset-based revolving credit facility due, in part, to certain covenants regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash during Fiscal 2023, and we may continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. As of February 28, 2023, we had $41.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $37.3 million from February 28, 2022. Our future performance is subject to economic, operational, financial, competitive and other factors, including the current inflationary environment, supply chain constraints and the impact of uncertain international trade relations. We may not be able to access additional funds under our asset-based revolving credit facility. The credit facility contains certain negative and affirmative covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, if our liquidity position (consisting of specified cash balances plus unused availability on the revolving credit facility) falls below $40.0 million on such day. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants in the credit agreement and access our revolving credit facility will be materially affected if our liquidity position falls below $40.0 million. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Specifically, we may be unable to secure additional debt financing without restrictive terms or issue additional equity without impacting our stock price or being materially dilutive to existing stockholders. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to access or raise adequate funds to finance our forecasted expenditures, we may have to make significant changes or reductions to our operations. We also may have to reduce sales, marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our existing or new products, or we may need to cease operations. Any of these actions could materially impede our ability to achieve our business objectives and could materially harm our operating results. If our cash, cash equivalents and investments are insufficient to fund our projected operating requirements and we are unable to access additional funds under our credit facility or raise additional capital, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects and ability to continue as a going concern.We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash, or repay the 2025 Convertible Notes at maturity or repurchase them upon a fundamental change, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to fund through operations the necessary amount of capital to repay these obligations.We have $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (“2025 Convertible Notes” or “Notes”) outstanding. As of February 28, 2023, we had $41.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $37.3 million from February 28, 2022.Upon maturity of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we may be required to make cash payments in repayment of the notes. In addition, upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. Furthermore, holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the 2025 Convertible Notes, to pay cash upon 12Table of Contents maturity of the 2025 Convertible Notes or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes.  Our ability to pay cash upon conversion of or at maturity of the 2025 Convertible Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors including the current inflationary environment, supply chain constraints and the uncertainties regarding international trade relations due in part to the armed conflict in Ukraine. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.Our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the 2025 Convertible Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under the indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the notes.Holders may convert their 2025 Convertible Notes into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The current conversion rate of the 2025 Convertible Notes is 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $30.75 per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their 2025 Convertible Notes at their option upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes.We may not have the ability to raise the funds required to pay our obligations under our 2025 Convertible Notes, or extend the maturity date of the 2025 Convertible Notes, and any adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to repay our 2025 Convertible Notes at maturity. If we are unable to pay these obligations or otherwise unable to extend the maturity dates or refinance these obligations, we would be in default. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to fund through operations the necessary amount of capital to repay these obligations, or that we will be able to extend the maturity dates or otherwise refinance these obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our 2025 Convertible Notes are rated by certain major credit rating agencies. These credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and certain financial metrics including debt levels. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets, including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic areas, could also impair our ability to raise funding.Our asset-based revolving credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. Our senior asset-based revolving credit facility contains, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock, or make other restricted payments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. 13Table of Contents Our revolving credit facility also contains a financial covenant that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if our liquidity position, consisting of specified cash balances plus unused availability on the revolving credit facility, falls below $40.0 million on such day. Additionally, our revolving credit facility contains a cash dominion trigger whereby PNC Bank may direct domestic cash balances and receipts to pay down borrowings under the revolving credit facility should our liquidity position, consisting of specified cash balances plus unused availability on the revolving credit facility, fall below $25.0 million at the end of any month. As of February 28, 2023, we were in compliance with our covenants under the revolving credit facility. However, if we are unable to comply with our covenants under the revolving credit facility in the future, our availability of cash resources may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.  Our ability to comply with these conditions will be materially affected if our liquidity position falls below $40.0 million. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and conditions beyond our control, including the factors discussed above. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement and related credit documents, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility to become immediately due and payable. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ConditionComponent shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico and other Pacific Rim countries. We accelerated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. This program was initiated against the backdrop of the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This transition contributed to various supply disruptions, including component shortages, beginning in the third and fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. Additionally, during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023, we experienced supply shortages as a result of global supply imbalances initially driven by the global pandemic, which have negatively impacted all parts of our business. Although we are taking steps to address these matters, the related operational challenges and supply chain disruptions may persist for some time.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and the continued effects of the pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued spread of new variants and the measures taken to limit its spread has had, and other pandemics in the future could have, adverse repercussions across global economies and financial markets, as well as on us. Through Fiscal 2022, our revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as various small-to-medium customers postponed their capital expenditure due to the pandemic and related macro-economic uncertainties. We have experienced supply shortages as a result of global supply imbalances driven by the global pandemic. These global supply imbalances have negatively impacted our business during Fiscal 2023. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our future business or operating results, which are highly dependent on uncertain future developments, including the severity of the continuing pandemic, the actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment and the resolution of supply chain issues and supply shortages. Because our business is dependent on telematics product sales, device installations and related subscription-based services, the ultimate effect of COVID-19 and the current supply shortages may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.To the extent that COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section.14Table of Contents Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. Instances of continued supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as continued heightened inflation, could lead to inefficiencies and increased costs that could negatively impact our performance and our results of operations. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, a decline in net revenue and a loss of market share as our customers could choose to purchase competing products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a pandemic, natural disaster, trade wars, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure, inflationary pressures, component shortage or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, the loss of or significant decline or slowdown of sales to these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues depend on a small number of significant customers and some of them represented more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2023, 2022 and 2021 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements). They are also expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. As a result, the loss of any one of these customers, or a decline or slowdown in purchases from any of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage levels of data transmission by our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers, which has and could continue to occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of our subscriber base could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation.The United States has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States was approximately 6.5% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. If the inflation rate continues to increase and increase our costs of labor and supplies, it will affect our operating expenses. The current inflationary environment related to increased aggregate demand, supply chain constraints and the effects from the armed conflict in Ukraine (including the effects of the sanctions that were implemented in response to the conflict and the resulting impacts on the commodity market and supply chains) have also increased our operating expenses and may continue to affect our operating expenses. Our operational costs, including the cost of supplies, labor, manufacturing and our other operational costs are subject to market conditions and are being adversely affected by inflationary pressures. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Additionally, rising interest rates could impact financing availability and the cost of refinancing our existing debt, and exchange rate fluctuations. The United States is experiencing a workforce shortage, which in turn, has created a competitive wage environment that may increase our operating costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market, it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. To the extent periods of high inflation are prolonged, these results may be exacerbated.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or will maintain or capture increased market share.15Table of Contents The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants and with the possible consolidation of competitors. Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we continually review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price:•use a substantial portion of our available cash;•require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition;•incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity;•issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage;•assume contingent liabilities; and•take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.16Table of Contents Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization; and a negative effect on our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of business activities that no longer fit our strategic plan.We may engage in future dispositions or wind-downs of certain businesses. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:•our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;•our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained business activities;•our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business activity had with our retained business activities;•our ability to replace legacy earnings from the exited business or activity with new revenues; and•our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services. Our presence in the Internet of Things (“IoT”) industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use, collect, process, transmit and store, within our own systems and systems of third-party providers, sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. Despite our security measures, our information technology (“IT”) systems have been and will continue to be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Our measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats may not be successful in preventing a security incident or data breach or limiting the effects of such a breach. This is particularly so because attack methodologies change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we also may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.17Table of Contents Any security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Repurposing of satellite spectrum by adjacent operators of L-band spectrum for terrestrial services could interfere with our GPS IoT products and services.In 2011, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) granted Ligado Networks (then known as Lightsquared) (“Ligado”) a waiver to convert its L-band satellite spectrum to terrestrial use, including a 10 MHz band close to the spectrum that we use for all of our Global Positioning System (“GPS”) products and services. That waiver was subsequently suspended in 2012 due to concerns about potential interference to GPS operations. Ligado sought another waiver in 2015, that it then amended in 2018, to modify its L-band mobile satellite service network with a terrestrial-only proposal designed to address GPS industry-wide concerns. In April 2020, the FCC granted Ligado’s waiver request. We oppose this waiver grant out of concern for the interference that we believe Ligado’s proposed operations would cause to our IoT GPS devices. Ligado’s operations pursuant to the waiver would result in terrestrial use of L-band spectrum, and such operations may interfere with, and harmfully affect, the performance of the Global Navigation Satellite System (“GNSS”) receivers in our IoT GPS devices that operate in the 1559-1610MHz band, which is adjacent to, and within range of, the L-band downlink allocation for GPS operations. Ligado’s L-band terrestrial operations could impact our operations and impose costs on us to retrofit or replace affected GNSS receivers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A majority of our product orders are shipped in the final month of the quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of the quarter. Some of the other factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include:•the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services;•our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions;•announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors;•fluctuations in the cost of telematics devices due to supply shortages or other market factors;•our ability to achieve cost reductions;•our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products;•our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;•our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold;•the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers;•increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors;•fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and•changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally, including as a result of a pandemic or other catastrophic event.18Table of Contents Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results in such quarter. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines or if we fail to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses and lost revenue. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations and evolving wireless industry standards in each market. In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to align with evolving wireless standards and achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business. Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to continue to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product and service warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products, including those that enable our service offerings, could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.19Table of Contents Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.We may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system initiatives.We depend on our IT systems for the efficient functioning of our global business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In order to integrate and enhance our global operations, we initiated the phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system across our global operating locations to support our operations. The implementation of this ERP system required, and will continue to require, the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred, and expect to incur, additional expenses as we continue to implement, enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP initiatives, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and adequately service our customers. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP initiatives, our business and operations could be disrupted, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our global operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the U.S., we are subject to different regulatory regimes. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process, and therefore, we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers from continuing operations outside the U.S. accounted for 37%, 33% and 35% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 28, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.20Table of Contents Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal MattersOur global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business or operating results.Global developments (including those related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union or other similar global regulations), or the perception that additional developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. Given our recent efforts to expand our business throughout Europe, these developments could affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. In the U.S., the FCC regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products and services we currently sell, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products and services on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the U.S. in which we currently sell our products and services or in which we may sell our products and services in the future. Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. We import certain products and components from suppliers in China. In the past, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China, resulting in ongoing trade tensions. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our revenue or operating results. Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to data privacy and the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees 21Table of Contents for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The U.S. and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information (including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018). Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Furthermore, other international jurisdictions, including Singapore, South Korea, China, Brazil, Mexico and Australia, have also implemented laws relating to data privacy and protection.Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations, cash and non-cash penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold almost 300 patents worldwide. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future, we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.22Table of Contents Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware, software and services solutions may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the mobile resource management (“MRM”) and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time-consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.23Table of Contents Risks Related to Third PartiesWe depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages to us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. In addition, our expenses would increase, and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors.We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service, and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Additional Risks Related to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for the 2025 Convertible Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Under applicable accounting standards that became effective March 1, 2022, the shares underlying the 2025 Convertible Notes will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share using the “if converted” method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the 2025 Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share, and accounting standards may change in the future in a manner that may adversely affect our diluted earnings per share.24Table of Contents The capped call, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our Notes and our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing any hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect investors’ ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that investors will receive upon conversion of the Notes.The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the capped call and/or convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the 2025 Convertible Notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the 2025 Convertible Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results;•acts of, or escalations in, war or terrorism;25Table of Contents •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance;•sales of our common stock by us, or insiders or our other stockholders;•changes in key management personnel;•announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;•developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights; •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors; •the mix of products and services sold; •the effects of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic;•the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders; •product and service pricing and discounts; •fluctuations in interest rates and inflation rates; and•general economic conditions.Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. To the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, that conversion could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. In circumstances other than at maturity, the 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $30.7450 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments.General Risk Factors
Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.A severe or prolonged economic downturn, additional global financial crises, macroeconomic issues or trade imbalances caused by events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation, rising interest rates, availability of capital markets, energy availability and costs or governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions could result in a variety of risks to our business, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in further supply disruption.We cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control. If these conditions deteriorate for extended periods, however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.26Table of Contents Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; •any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; •any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and •any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated and amended bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our stock price could decline.Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.27Table of Contents If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.  We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future. The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations.Over the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $7.62 to a low of $2.96. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.We may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As discussed in Note 13, as of February 28, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating losses and tax credits in U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized. We considered positive and negative evidence, including three years of cumulative losses considering forecasts of future profitability as of February 28, 2023, in assessing our ability to realize our domestic net deferred tax assets.28Table of Contents Also, as of February 28, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80.6 million and $87.8 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change. The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than fifty (50) percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock, over a three (3)-year period. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We continue to monitor stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock to determine if we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382"
1,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2022-04-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors that are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Among others, and including those described in this section “Item 1A. Risk Factors
”, these risks include: •Our contract manufacturers and diversified supply chain, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  •The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations. •Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and we generally do not have long-term contracts with customers, the loss or significant decline or slowdown of sales to these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. •Our operations are subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation. •Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or will maintain or capture increased market share.10Table of Contents  •We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, and are at risk of future attacks, which could damage our reputation, vendor and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services. •The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. •If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability. •If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines or if we fail to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards, our business could be adversely affected. •Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations. •Our global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally. •Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable. •Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. •We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position. •We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future. •We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow. •We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes. •The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ConditionOur contract manufacturers and diversified supply chain, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We accelerated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. This program was initiated against the backdrop of the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This transition contributed to various supply disruptions, including component shortages, beginning in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we experienced supply shortages as a result of global supply imbalances initially driven by the global pandemic, which have negatively impacted all parts of our business. Although we are taking steps to address these matters, the related operational challenges and supply chain disruptions may persist for some time.The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak has spread globally, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, 11Table of Contents quarantines and travel bans, each intended to control the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe global disruptions which have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. This pandemic could negatively affect our ability to sell-through our backlog. Our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and customers may suffer. Our customers could shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during the pandemic-caused economic downturn as a result of various factors, including workforce reductions, reduced access to credit, and changes in federal economic policy. In particular, customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their purchases and inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers, our ability to attract new customers, and the financial condition of our customers. Decreases in demand for our products and solutions without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on our margins and would negatively impact our financial results. Governmental organizations, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local governments, have recommended and/or imposed increased community-based interventions, including event cancellations, social distancing measures, and restrictions on gatherings. Through fiscal 2021, our revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as various small-to-medium customers postponed their capital expenditure due to the pandemic and related macro-economic uncertainties. Although our business was initially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of fiscal 2021, we resumed device installation and activation services soon thereafter. We have experienced supply shortages as a result of global supply imbalances driven by the global pandemic. These global supply imbalances have negatively impacted all parts of our business during fiscal 2022. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our future business or operating results, which are highly dependent on uncertain future developments, including the severity of the continuing pandemic, the actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment and the resolution of supply chain issues and supply shortages. Because our business is dependent on telematics product sales, device installations and related subscription-based services, the ultimate effect of COVID-19 and the current supply shortages may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.To the extent that COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. Instances of continued supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as continued heightened inflation, could lead to inefficiencies and increased costs that could negatively impact our performance and our results of operations. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, a decline in net revenue and a loss of market share as our customers could choose to purchase competing products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a pandemic, natural disaster, trade wars, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure, component shortage or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations. 12Table of Contents  Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and we generally do not have long-term contracts with customers, the loss of or significant decline or slowdown of sales to these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues depend on a small number of significant customers and some of them represented more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2022, 2021 and 2020 (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). They are also expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. As a result, the loss of any one of these customers, or a decline or slowdown in purchases from any of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage levels of data transmission by our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers, which has and could continue to occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of our subscriber base could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products and services from us at any time without penalty, are free to purchase products and services from our competitors, may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations are subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation. The United States has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States was approximately 7.0% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. If the inflation rate continues to increase, such as increases in the costs of labor and supplies, it will affect our expenses. Additionally, the United States is experiencing an acute workforce shortage, which in turn, has created a hyper-competitive wage environment that may increase our operating costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market, it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or will maintain or capture increased market share.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants and with the possible consolidation of competitors. Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.13Table of Contents If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of certain business activities that no longer fit our strategic plan. Effective March 15, 2021, we sold certain assets and transferred certain liabilities related to our LoJack North America business. We may engage in future dispositions or wind-downs of certain businesses. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: •our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; •our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained business activities; •our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business activity had with our retained business activities; •our ability to replace legacy earnings from the exited business or activity with new revenues; and •our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we continually review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we acquired LoJack Mexico and Synovia, and we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price: •use a substantial portion of our available cash; •require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition; •incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity; •issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage; •assume contingent liabilities; and •take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.14Table of Contents  Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization; and a negative effect on our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services. Our presence in the Internet of Things (“IoT”) industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems have been and will continue to be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems.  We experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. For example, we detected and interrupted a ransomware attack on a portion of our network in February 2021, which led to the theft of company data and notifications to affected third parties, and we experienced a second attempt to hack our network in March 2021. In response, we retained outside experts to advise on the incidents and to make recommendations for security improvements. While we have not experienced any material loss or expense relating to these cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional attacks or incur more serious financial consequences or expense in the future. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Any security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Repurposing of satellite spectrum by adjacent operators of L-band spectrum for terrestrial services could interfere with our GPS IoT products and services.In 2011, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) granted Ligado Networks (then known as Lightsquared) (“Ligado”) a waiver to convert its L-band satellite spectrum to terrestrial use, including a 10 MHz band close to the spectrum that we use for all of our Global Positioning System (“GPS”) products and services. That waiver was subsequently suspended in 2012 due to concerns about potential interference to GPS operations. Ligado sought another waiver in 2015, that it then amended in 2018, to modify its L-band mobile satellite service network with a 15Table of Contents terrestrial-only proposal designed to address GPS industry-wide concerns. In April 2020, the FCC granted Ligado’s waiver request. We oppose this waiver grant out of concern for the interference that we believe Ligado’s proposed operations would cause to our IoT GPS devices. Ligado’s operations pursuant to the waiver would result in terrestrial use of L-band spectrum, and such operations may interfere with, and harmfully affect, the performance of the Global Navigation Satellite System (“GNSS”) receivers in our IoT GPS devices that operate in the 1559-1610MHz band, which is adjacent to, and within range of, the L-band downlink allocation for GPS operations. Ligado’s L-band terrestrial operations could impact our operations and impose costs on us to retrofit or replace affected GNSS receivers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A majority of our product orders are shipped in the final month of the quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of the quarter. Some of the other factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include: •the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services; •our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions; •announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors; •fluctuations in the cost of telematics devices due to supply shortages or other market factors; •our ability to achieve cost reductions; •our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products; •our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; •our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold; •the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers; •increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors; •fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and •changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally, including as a result of a pandemic or other catastrophic event.Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results in such quarter. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines or if we fail to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses and lost revenue. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations and evolving wireless industry standards in each market. In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future 16Table of Contents applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to align with evolving wireless standards and achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business. Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product and service warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products, including those that enable our service offerings, could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.We may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system initiatives.We depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our global business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In order to integrate and enhance our global operations, we initiated the phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system across our global operating locations to support our operations. The implementation of this ERP system required, and will continue to require, the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred, and expect to incur, additional expenses as we continue to implement, enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP initiatives, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and adequately service our customers. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP initiatives, our business and operations could be disrupted, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our global operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.17Table of Contents Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the U.S., we are subject to different regulatory regimes. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process, and therefore, we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers from continuing operations outside the U.S. accounted for 33%, 35% and 31% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal MattersOur global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business or operating results. Global developments (including those related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union or other similar global regulations), or the perception that additional developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. Given our recent efforts to expand our business throughout Europe, these developments could affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18Table of Contents Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. In the U.S., the FCC regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products and services we currently sell, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products and services on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the U.S. in which we currently sell our products and services or in which we may sell our products and services in the future. Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. We import certain products and components from suppliers in China. In the past, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China, resulting in ongoing trade tensions. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our revenue or operating results. Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to data privacy and the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business. Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The U.S. and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information (including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018). Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations, cash and non-cash penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 19Table of Contents  Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold almost 300 patents worldwide. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future,we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware, software and services solutions may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the mobile resource management (“MRM”) and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time-consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all or 20Table of Contents that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.Risks Related to Third PartiesWe depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages to us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. In addition, our expenses would increase, and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors. We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service, and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Risks Related to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.We have $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (“2025 Convertible Notes” or “Notes”) outstanding. Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $30.7450 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their Notes at their option upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the applicable indenture. 21Table of Contents Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the Notes being converted or at their maturity.In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A fundamental change under such indenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the Notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their principal amount over the term of the Notes. We report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument’s non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2025 Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of this method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected.In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation of a convertible debt instrument into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. The standard is effective for interim 22Table of Contents and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We expect the primary impacts of this new standard will be to increase the carrying value of the 2025 Convertible Notes and reduce our reported interest expense. In addition, we will be required to use the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share.The capped call, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our Notes and our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing any hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect investors’ ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that investors will receive upon conversion of the Notes.The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the capped call and/or convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.We are subject to risks associated with debt financing. Our revolving credit facility contains, among other things, certain negative and affirmative covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges (Adjusted EBITDA) to interest ratio, a minimum senior indebtedness ratio and a total indebtedness coverage ratio, all measured on a quarterly basis. While we have not previously breached any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement, at February 28, 2022 we were in violation of the total indebtedness coverage ratio covenant. Our revolving credit facility was set to expire on March 30, 2022 but was extended to June 30, 2022 as we are presently in negotiations to enter into a new revolving credit facility. Although we intend to enter into a replacement revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a credit facility with similar terms or at all. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and conditions beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement and related credit documents, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our 23Table of Contents revolving credit facility to become immediately due and payable. These covenants could also limit our ability to seek capital through the incurrence of new indebtedness or, if we are unable to meet our obligations, require us to repay any outstanding amounts with sources of capital we may otherwise use to fund our business.We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the 2025 Convertible Notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; •the effects of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic; •acts of war or terrorism; •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance; •changes in key management personnel; •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; •developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  •the mix of products and services sold;  •the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  •product and service pricing and discounts; and  •general economic conditions.Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In July 2018, we issued the Notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the Notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. General Risk Factors
The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain 24Table of Contents interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and cyber and corporate espionage. Russia’s recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to an unprecedented expansion of sanction programs imposed by the United States, the EU, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including, among others:  •blocking sanctions against some of the largest state-owned and private Russian financial institutions (and their subsequent removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) payment system) and certain Russian businesses, some of which have significant financial and trade ties to the European Union; •blocking sanctions against Russian and Belarusian individuals, including the Russian President, other politicians and those with government connections or involved in Russian military activities; and  •blocking of Russia’s foreign currency reserves as well as expansion of sectoral sanctions and export and trade restrictions, limitations on investments and access to capital markets and bans on various Russian imports. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the EU, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia, Belarus and other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and assessing its impact on our business. To date we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure, supplies, technology systems or networks needed to support our operations. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:  •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;25Table of Contents   •any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;  •any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and  •any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated and amended bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our stock price could decline.Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.26Table of Contents Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.  We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future. The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations. Over the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $14.51 to a low of $4.99. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.We may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As discussed in Note 14, as of February 28, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating losses and tax credits in U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized. We considered positive and negative evidence, including three years of cumulative losses considering forecasts of future profitability as of February 28, 2022, in assessing our ability to realize our domestic net deferred tax assets. Also, as of February 28, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $75.3 million and $68.3 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change.  The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than fifty (50) percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock, over a three (3)-year period. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We continue to monitor stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock to determine if we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382.    "
3,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2021-04-22,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors, which are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.Summary of Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Among others, and including those described in this section “Item 1A. Risk Factors
”, these risks include: •Our accelerated supply chain diversification program, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  •The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. •Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations. •Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and we generally do not have long-term contracts with customers, the loss or significant decline or slowdown in purchases from any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. •Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share. •We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, and are at risk of future attacks, which could damage our reputation, vendor and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services. •If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.14Table of Contents  •Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations. •Our global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally. •Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable. •Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. •We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position. •We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future. •We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow. •We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes. •The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ConditionOur accelerated supply chain diversification program, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We accelerated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. This program was initiated against the backdrop of the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. These factors attributed to various supply disruptions, including component shortages, in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Although we are taking steps to address these matters, the related operational challenges and supply chain disruptions may persist for some time.The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak has spread globally, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, each intended to control the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe global disruptions. Additionally, we and other companies, are taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and imposing travel restrictions. These restrictions, and future prevention and mitigation measures, are likely to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending, which could materially adversely affect the supply and demand for our products and solutions. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. This pandemic could negatively affect our ability to sell-through our backlog. Our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and customers may suffer. Our customers could shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during the pandemic-caused economic downturn as a result of various factors, including workforce reductions, reduced access to credit, and changes in federal economic policy. In particular, customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their purchases and inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other 15Table of Contents things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers, our ability to attract new customers, and the financial condition of our customers. Decreases in demand for our products and solutions without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on our margins and would negatively impact our financial results. Governmental organizations, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local governments, have recommended and/or imposed increased community-based interventions, including event cancellations, social distancing measures, and restrictions on gatherings. Through fiscal 2021, our revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as various small-to-medium customers postponed their capital expenditure due to the pandemic and related macro-economic uncertainties. The pandemic has also created certain global supply imbalances resulting in supply shortages in certain components that we use. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our future business or operating results. The extent of such impact depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in the short or long term, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur, actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, timing of the availability of vaccines, and their distribution, acceptance and efficacy, and governmental, business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk.To the extent that COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, a decline in net revenue and a loss of market share as our customers could choose to purchase competing products, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a pandemic, natural disaster, trade wars, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations. Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and we generally do not have long-term contracts with customers, the loss or significant decline or slowdown in purchases from of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues depend on a small number of significant customers and some of them represent more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2021, 2020 and 2019 (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). They are also expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. As a result, the loss of any one of these customers, or decline or slowdown in purchases from any of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage levels of data transmission by our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers, which has and could continue to occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of our subscriber basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, 16Table of Contents financial condition and results of operations. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products and services from us at any time without penalty, are free to purchase products and services from our competitors, may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants and with the possible consolidation of competitors. Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of certain business activities that no longer fit our strategic plan. On March 15, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets related to our LoJack U.S. SVR and LoJack Canada businesses to Spireon Holdings, L.P. for a purchase price of $8.0 million. In addition, we may engage in future dispositions or wind-downs of certain business. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: •our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; •our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained business activities; •our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business activity had with our retained business activities; •our ability to replace legacy earnings from the exited business or activity with new revenues; and17Table of Contents   •our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we continually review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. In fiscal year 2019, we acquired Tracker and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we acquired LoJack Mexico and Synovia, and we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price: •use a substantial portion of our available cash; •require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition; •incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity; •issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage; •assume contingent liabilities; and •take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization; and a negative effect on our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services. Our presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems has been and will continue to be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems.  We experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. For example, we detected and interrupted a ransomware attack on a portion of our network in February 2021, which led to the theft of company data and notifications to affected third parties, and experienced a second attempt to hack our network in March 2021. In response, we retained outside experts to advise on the incidents and to make recommendations for security improvements. While we have not experienced any material loss or expense relating to these cyber-attacks or other 18Table of Contents information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional attacks or incur more serious financial consequences or expense in the future. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Any security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Repurposing of satellite spectrum by adjacent operators of L-band spectrum for terrestrial services could interfere with our GPS IoT products and services.In 2011, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) granted Ligado Networks (then known as Lightsquared) (“Ligado”) a waiver to convert its L-band satellite spectrum to terrestrial use, including a 10 MHz band close to the spectrum that we use for all of our Global Positioning System (“GPS”) products and services. That waiver was subsequently suspended in 2012 due to concerns about potential interference to GPS operations. Ligado sought another waiver in 2015, that it then amended in 2018, to modify its L-band mobile satellite service network with a terrestrial-only proposal designed to address GPS industry-wide concerns. In April 2020, the FCC granted Ligado’s waiver request. We oppose this waiver grant out of concern for the interference that we believe Ligado’s proposed operations would cause to our IoT GPS devices. Ligado’s operations pursuant to the waiver would result in terrestrial use of L-band spectrum, and such operations may interfere with, and harmfully affect, the performance of the Global Navigation Satellite System (“GNSS”) receivers in our IoT GPS devices that operate in the 1559-1610MHz band, which is adjacent to, and within range of, the L-band downlink allocation for GPS operations. Ligado’s L-band terrestrial operations could impact our operations and impose costs on us to retrofit or replace affected GNSS receivers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A majority of our product orders are shipped in the final month of the quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of the quarter. Some of the other factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include: •the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services; •our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions; •announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors; •our ability to achieve cost reductions; •our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products; •our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; •our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold; •the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers;19Table of Contents   •increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors; •fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and •changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally, including as a result of a pandemic or other catastrophic event.Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results in such quarter. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines or if we fail to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses and lost revenue. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations and evolving wireless industry standards in each market. In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to align with evolving wireless standards and achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.If our introduction of a DaaS subscription model is not embraced by enterprise customers, our business could be adversely affected.We recently introduced an innovative Device-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) subscription business model for certain products that enables enterprise customers to leverage more of our research and development investments and full portfolio of connected car software services to lower their business costs and drive new revenue streams from subscription services. If our enterprise customers do not broadly embrace this business model, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or 20Table of Contents property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in our products could have a material adverse effect our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.We may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system initiatives.We depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our global business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In order to integrate and enhance our global operations, we initiated the phased implementation of an ERP system across our global operating locations to support our operations. The implementation of this ERP system required, and will continue to require, the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred, and expect to incur, additional expenses as we continue to implement, enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP initiatives, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and adequately service our customers. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP initiatives, our business and operations could be disrupted, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our global operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the U.S., we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process, and therefore, we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers from continuing operations outside the U.S. accounted for 35.0%, 31.0% and 30.6% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.21Table of Contents Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal MattersOur global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees, business or operating results. Additionally, following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. Given our recent efforts to expand our business throughout Europe, these developments could affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common stock.Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. In the U.S., the FCC regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products we currently sell, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the U.S. in which we currently sell our products or in which we may sell its products in the future 22Table of Contents  Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. We import certain products and components from suppliers in China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China, resulting in ongoing trade tensions. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our revenue or operating results. Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to data privacy and the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS and DaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business. Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, includes customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The U.S. and various state governments (including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018) have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations, cash and non-cash penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold almost 300 patents worldwide. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors 23Table of Contents independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future,  we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the mobile resource management (“MRM”) and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time - consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.24Table of Contents Risks Related to Third PartiesWe depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages to us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. In addition, our expenses would increase, and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors. We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service, and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Risks Related to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.On May 15, 2020, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $27.6 million of our 1.625% senior unsecured notes issued in May 2015. Our $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (“2025 Convertible Notes”) remain outstanding. Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $30.7450 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the applicable indenture. Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notes being converted or at their maturity.25Table of Contents In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A fundamental change under such indenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the term of the convertible notes. We report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument’s non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of this method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected.In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation of a convertible debt instrument into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. At this time, we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.26Table of Contents The capped call, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our notes and our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing any hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes, which could affect your ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that investors will receive upon conversion of the notes.The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the capped call and/or convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.We are subject to risks associated with debt financing. Our revolving credit facility contains, among other things, certain negative and affirmative covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges (Adjusted EBITDA) to interest ratio, a minimum senior indebtedness ratio and a total indebtedness coverage ratio, all measured on a quarterly basis. While we have not previously breached and are not currently in breach of these or any other covenants contained in our credit agreement, there can be no guarantee that we will not breach these covenants in the future. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement and related credit documents, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility to become immediately due and payable. These covenants could also limit our ability to seek capital through the incurrence of new indebtedness or, if we are unable to meet our obligations, require us to repay any outstanding amounts with sources of capital we may otherwise use to fund our business.27Table of Contents We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; •the effects of the recent global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance; •changes in key management personnel; •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; •developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  •the mix of products and services sold;  •the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  •product and service pricing and discounts;  •acts of war or terrorism; and  •general economic conditions.Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In May 2015 and July 2018, we issued the Notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. General Risk Factors
Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of Directors, 28Table of Contents including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:  •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;  •any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;  •any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and  •any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated and amended bylaws further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our stock price could decline.Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.29Table of Contents If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.  We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future. The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations. Over the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $11.98 to a low of $3.70. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.We may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As discussed in Note 14, as of February 28, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating losses and tax credits in U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized. We considered positive and negative evidence, including three years of cumulative losses considering forecasts of future profitability as of February 28, 2021, in assessing our ability to realize our domestic net deferred tax assets. 30Table of Contents  Also, as of February 28, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $50.4 million and $48.4 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change.  The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than fifty (50) percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock, over a three (3)-year period. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We continue to monitor stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock to determine if we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382.    "
4,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2020-05-06,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors, which are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.14Table of Contents Our accelerated supply chain diversification program, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We accelerated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. This program was initiated against the backdrop of the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. These factors attributed to various supply disruptions, including component shortages, in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Although we are taking steps to address these matters, the related operational challenges and supply chain disruptions may persist for some time.The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic—the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The outbreak has reached more than 160 countries, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 outbreak has already caused severe global disruptions. In response to the virus, China and Italy (where we have a subsidiary in Milan) placed tens of millions of people under lockdown. Spain and France also recently implemented lockdown measures, and other countries and local governments may enact similar policies. As of April 30, 2020, the United States has temporarily restricted travel by foreign nationals into the country from a number of places, including China and Europe. In addition, on March 18, 2020, the U.S. and Canada agreed to restrict all nonessential travel across the border. We, and other companies, are also taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and imposing travel restrictions. These restrictions, and future prevention and mitigation measures, are likely to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending, which could materially adversely affect the supply and demand for our products and solutions. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 is likely to result in sustained market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. This pandemic could negatively affect our ability to sell-through our backlog. Our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and customers may suffer. Our customers could shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during the pandemic-caused economic downturn as a result of various factors, including workforce reductions, reduced access to credit, and changes in federal economic policy. In particular, customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their purchases and inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers, our ability to attract new consumers, and the financial condition of our customers. Decreases in demand for our products and solutions without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on our margins and would negatively impact our financial results. Governmental organizations, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local governments, have recommended and/or imposed increased community-based interventions, including event cancellations, social distancing measures, and restrictions on gatherings of more than ten people. The governors of several states have temporarily closed bars and restaurants, and others may follow suit. As of April 30, 2020, California and New York residents were under a shelter-in-place order. On March 30, 2020, President Trump announced a shelter-in-place extension through April 30, 2020. In the future, government authorities may impose similar and/or additional restrictions on people’s movement, public gatherings and businesses. The extent of COVID-19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, if the pandemic continues to evolve into a severe worldwide health crisis, the disease could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.15Table of Contents We generally do not have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing our products and services at any time, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products and services from us at any time without penalty, are free to purchase products and services from our competitors, may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, the loss or significant decline or slowdown in growth in business of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues depend on a small number of significant customers and some of them represent more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements). They are also expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. As a result, the loss of any one of these customers, or decline or slowdown in the growth in business of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage levels of data transmission by our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers, which has and could continue to occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of our subscriber basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers of manufacturing services and critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a pandemic, natural disaster, trade wars, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.16Table of Contents Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants and with the possible consolidation of competitors. Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. In fiscal 2017, we acquired LoJack. In fiscal 2019, we acquired Tracker and in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we acquired LoJack Mexico and Synovia, and we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price: •use a substantial portion of our available cash; •require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition; •incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity; •issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage; •assume contingent liabilities; and •take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.17Table of Contents Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results.Any acquisitions we make and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers.If we make any acquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A majority of our product orders are shipped in the final month of the quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of the quarter. Some of the other factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include: •the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services; •our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions; •announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors; •our ability to achieve cost reductions; •our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products; •our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; •our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold; •the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers; •increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors; •fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and •changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally, including as a result of a pandemic or other catastrophic event.18Table of Contents Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses and lost revenue. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.If our introduction of a DaaS subscription model is not embraced by enterprise customers, our business could be adversely affected.We recently introduced an innovative Device-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) subscription business model for certain products that enables enterprise customers to leverage more of our research and development investments and full portfolio of connected car software services to lower their business costs and drive new revenue streams from subscription services. If our enterprise customers do not broadly embrace this business model, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the U.S., we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 27.2%, 26.2% and 27.4% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.19Table of Contents Our global operations and continued international expansion expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees, business or operating results. Additionally, the announcement of the Referendum of the U.K.’s Membership of the European Union (referred to as Brexit), advising for the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, particularly given our recent efforts to expand our business throughout Europe through our acquisition of Tracker UK. Brexit could affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. Ongoing changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. We import certain products and components from suppliers in China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China, resulting in ongoing trade tensions. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our revenue or operating results.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 84 U.S. patents and 221 foreign patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.20Table of Contents We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future,  we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the mobile resource management (“MRM”) and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time - consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.21Table of Contents We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business.We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS and DaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.Evolving regulation relating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, includes customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The U.S. and various state governments (including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018) have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations, cash and non-cash penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services.Our presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. We require usernames and passwords in order 22Table of Contents to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers’, or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase, and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors.Our failure to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell new products and services.In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed.Our business could be adversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietary Internet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. 23Table of Contents If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the U.S. in which we currently sell our products or in which we may sell its products in the future.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.24Table of Contents Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in our products could have a material adverse effect our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.We may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system initiatives.We depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our global business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In order to integrate and enhance our global operations, we initiated the phased implementation of an ERP system across our global operating locations to support our operations. The implementation of this ERP system required, and will continue to require, the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses as we continue to implement, enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP initiatives, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and adequately service our customers. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP initiatives, our business and operations could be disrupted, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our global operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Risks Relating to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.We have two outstanding convertible senior unsecured notes – a $27.6 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior unsecured notes due in May 2020 (“2020 Convertible Notes”) and a $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (“2025 Convertible Notes”, and collectively with the 2020 Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). Holders of the 2020 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 36.2398 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $27.594 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to November 15, 2019 upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as defined in the applicable indenture. During the period from November 15, 2019 to May 13, 2020, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. As of February 29, 2020, none of the holders of the 2020 Convertible Notes elected to convert since our shares have been trading under the initial conversion price. Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $30.7450 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the applicable indenture. 25Table of Contents Upon conversion of one or both of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notes being converted or at their maturity.In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A fundamental change under such indenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the term of the convertible notes. We report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument’s non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of this method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected.26Table of Contents The capped call, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our notes and our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions that we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of any convertible notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect if and to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.We have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their initial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the convertible notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of convertible notes or following any repurchase of convertible notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could suppress or inflate the market price of our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing any hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes, which could affect your ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that investors will receive upon conversion of the notes.The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the capped call and/or convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.27Table of Contents We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; •the effects of the recent global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance; •changes in key management personnel; •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; •developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  •the mix of products and services sold;  •the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  •product and service pricing and discounts;  •acts of war or terrorism; and  •general economic conditions.Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future.The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations.Over the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $14.69 to a low of $8.99. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.28Table of Contents Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In May 2015 and July 2018, we issued the Notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:  •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;  •any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;  •any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and  •any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated and amended bylaws further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 29Table of Contents The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our stock price could decline.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.  We may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  As discussed in Note 13, as of February 29, 2020, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating losses and tax credits in U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized. We considered positive and negative evidence, including three years of cumulative losses considering forecasts of future profitability as of February 29, 2020, in assessing our ability to realize our domestic net deferred tax assets. Also, as of February 29, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $38.9 million and $36.8 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change. The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than fifty (50) percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock, over a three (3)-year period. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We continue to monitor stockholders who own directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock to determine if we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382.    30Table of Contents "
16,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2019-05-01,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors, which are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.Our accelerated supply chain diversification program, component shortages and uncertainty in international trade relations with China may adversely impact us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  We accelerated our supply chain diversification program to transition our manufacturing to tier one global contract manufacturers with facilities outside of China. This program was initiated against the backdrop of the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. These factors attributed to various supply disruptions, including component shortages, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Although we are taking steps to address these matters, the related operational challenges and supply chain disruptions may persist for some time.We generally do not have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing our products and services at any time, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products and services from us at any time without penalty, are free to purchase products and services from our competitors, may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.11Table of Contents Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, the loss or significant decline or slowdown in growth in business of any of these customers could have an adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues depend on a small number of significant customers and some of them represent more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 3). They are also expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. As a result, the loss of any one of these customers, or decline or slowdown in the growth in business of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage levels of data transmission by our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers, which has and could continue to occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of our subscriber basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers of manufacturing services and critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a natural disaster, trade wars, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants and with the possible consolidation of competitors. Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.12Table of Contents If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. In fiscal 2017, we acquired LoJack. In fiscal 2019, we acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited and in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we acquired Car Track, S.A. de C.V. and Synovia Solutions, and we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price: •use a substantial portion of our available cash; •require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition; •incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity; •issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage; •assume contingent liabilities; and •take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results.Any acquisitions we make and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers.If we make any acquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.13Table of Contents Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. In fact, our customers usually request that a majority of our product orders be shipped in the final months of the quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of the quarter. Some of the other factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include: •the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services; •our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions; •announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors; •our ability to achieve cost reductions; •our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products; •our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; •our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold; •the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers; •increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors; •fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and •changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally.Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses and lost revenue. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.14Table of Contents If our introduction of a DaaS subscription model is not embraced by enterprise customers, our business could be adversely affected.We recently introduced an innovative Device-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) subscription business model for certain products that enables enterprise customers to leverage more of our research and development investments and full portfolio of connected car software services to lower their business costs and drive new revenue streams from subscription services. If our enterprise customers do not broadly embrace this business model, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the U.S., we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 26.2%, 27.4% and 26.0% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees, business or operating results.15Table of Contents Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.Changes to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.We import certain products and components from suppliers in China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. In September 2018, the USTR enacted another tariff on the import of other Chinese products with an additional combined import value of approximately $250 billion. The tariff became effective on September 24, 2018, with an initial rate of 10%. The current Administration has delayed a hike in the tariff rate to 25% originally planned for January 2019, although the tariff rate may be raised above 10% in the future. Although some of the products and components we import are included on this list, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the current Administration continues to signal that it may further alter trade agreements between China and the U.S. and may impose additional tariffs on imports from China. It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our revenue or operating results. The announcement of the Referendum of the U.K.’s Membership of the European Union (referred to as Brexit), advising for the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, particularly given our recent efforts to expand our business throughout Europe through our acquisition of TRACKER. Brexit could affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operationsWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 73 U.S. patents and 200 foreign patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.16Table of Contents Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the mobile resource management (“MRM”) and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time - consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business.We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS and DaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.17Table of Contents Evolving regulation relating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, includes customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The U.S. and various state governments (including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018) have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations, cash and non-cash penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services.Our presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers’, or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.18Table of Contents We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors.Our failure to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell new products and services.In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed.Our business could be adversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietary Internet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.19Table of Contents We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the U.S. in which it currently sell our products or in which we may sell its products in the future.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in our products could have a material adverse effect our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.Risks Relating to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.We have two outstanding convertible senior unsecured notes – a $122.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2020 (“2020 Convertible Notes”) and a $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2025 (“2025 Convertible Notes”, and collectively with the 2020 Convertible Notes, the “Notes”). 20Table of Contents Holders of the 2020 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2020 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 36.2398 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $27.594 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to November 15, 2019 upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as defined in the applicable indenture. During the period from November 15, 2019 to May 13, 2020, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 32.5256 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $30.7450 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the applicable indenture. Upon conversion of one or both of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notes being converted or at their maturity.In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A fundamental change under such indenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt 21Table of Contents component of the convertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the term of the convertible notes. We report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument’s non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of this method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected.The capped call, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our notes and our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions that we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of any convertible notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect if and to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.We have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their initial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the convertible notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of convertible notes or following any repurchase of convertible notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could suppress or inflate the market price of our common stock.In connection with the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing any hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes, which could affect your ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that investors will receive upon conversion of the notes.22Table of Contents The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the capped call and/or convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance; •changes in key management personnel; •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; •developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  •the mix of products and services sold;  •the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  •product and service pricing and discounts;  •acts of war or terrorism; and  •general economic conditions.23Table of Contents Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future.The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations.Over the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $24.81 to a low of $10.91. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In May 2015 and July 2018, we issued the Notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.    "
7,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2018-05-10,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factors, which are applicable to our business and speaks as of the date of this document. These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us.We generally do not have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing our products and services at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products and services from us at any time without penalty, are free to purchase products and services from our competitors, may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.10Table of Contents Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products and services will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and services in the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully.Information about our competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “COMPETITION”.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include: •the timing and amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or services; •our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products, services and enhancements, and manage product and services transitions; •announcements of new product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products and services offered by our competitors; •our ability to achieve cost reductions; •our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products; •our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; •our ability to maintain the volume of products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold; •the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers; •increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors; •fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and •changes in telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally.Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.11Table of Contents Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If we do not meet product and services introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products, services and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products and services on the addition of new features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products and services that comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new products, services, product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products, services or features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.Dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers of manufacturing services and critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. In such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers’ supply as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.If demand for our products and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are largely fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.12Table of Contents Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and services in countries other than the United States, we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and services and further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 27.4%, 26.0% and 17.0% of our total sales for fiscal years ended February 28, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products and services to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business.Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws that prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products or services in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees, business or operating results.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Credit market dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and services if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currencies can have an impact on demand for our products and services for which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.13Table of Contents We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 67 U.S. patents and 225 foreign patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.Many of our products and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our products, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our products, software and services and otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products and services and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover products, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by our products, software and services. In addition, patent applications in the United States may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our products, software and services. Furthermore, because of rapid technological changes in the MRM and IoT marketplaces, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.In the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some third parties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties.14Table of Contents Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time - consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products and services, product and services launches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products, software and services, or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology.We may be subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business.We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, product liability and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include money damages. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods. See also “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.We are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.Any acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. In fiscal 2017 we acquired LoJack, and we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price: •use a substantial portion of our available cash; •require a significant devotion of management’s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any acquisition; •incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity;15Table of Contents  •issue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentage; •assume contingent liabilities; and •take substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results.Any acquisitions we make and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers.If we make any acquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase and profitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors.Our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.As a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product and services development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products and services, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.Our failure to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell new products and services.In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products and services comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products and services that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products and services to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products and services, then sales of our new products and services designed to those standards could be materially harmed.16Table of Contents Our business could be adversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietary Internet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.Our telematics products and software services depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our business. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. Evolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS and Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) business model. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.Evolving regulation relating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case of our field service application, includes customer information, job data, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of our solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) will take effect in May 2018. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union. For example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data. In addition, the GDPR will include significant penalties for non-compliance.If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers’ ability to use and share this data, or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.17Table of Contents We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers’ access to our services.Our presence in the IoT industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber-attacks impacting these products or services. Our business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers’, or our business partners’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain of our SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Some of our products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.Some of our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunication networks. Although we have obtained the required FCC and various country approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or we may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than the United States in which it currently sell our products or in which we may sell its products in the future.We may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18Table of Contents Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 could materially affect our revenue recognitionAs discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Standards), effective March 1, 2018, we adopted the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We believe that ASC 606 and related revenue recognition policies will not result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements, and will not cause any significant changes to the amount and timing of our recognition of future revenue and cost. However, uncertainties in future guidance of the interpretation and application of ASC 606 could materially affect our revenue and cost recognition.Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued. The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a provision on the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, accounting treatment is clarified, we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.Our inability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in its products could have a material adverse effect our business.Many of our product lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials which are considered to be “conflict minerals” under the SEC’s rules. Those rules require public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.Risks Relating to Our Convertible Notes and IndebtednessWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.Holders of the $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes due 2020 that we issued in May 2015 (the “convertible notes”) will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The convertible notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on an initial conversion rate of 36.2398 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $27.594 per share of common stock, subject to customary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to November 15, 2019 upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as defined in the Indenture. During the period from November 15, 2019 to May 13, 2020, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of the convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the convertible notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notes being converted or at their maturity.19Table of Contents In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A fundamental change under the indenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes is triggered, holders of the convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the term of the convertible notes. We report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument’s non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of this method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected.The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our common stock.In connection with the sale of the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions that we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of any convertible 20Table of Contents notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect if and to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.We have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their initial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the convertible notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of convertible notes or following any repurchase of convertible notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could suppress or inflate the market price of our common stock.The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketFuture issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In May 2015, we issued the convertible notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy our business without the approval of our Board of 21Table of Contents Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; •failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance; •changes in key management personnel; •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; •developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  •proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  •the mix of products and services sold;  •the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  •product and service pricing and discounts;  •acts of war or terrorism; and  •general economic conditions.Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future.The market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts and our failure to meet market expectations.Over the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $25.45 to a low of $15.64. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In certain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy.    "
10,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2017-05-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidlychanging environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some ofwhich are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factorswhich are applicable to our Company and speaks as of the date of this document.These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and the trading priceof our common stock. We generally do nothave long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingour products at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.We generally do not havelong-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with ourcustomers generally do not provide us with any assurance of future sales. Thesecustomers can cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty,they are free to purchase products from our competitors, they may expose us tocompetitive price pressure on each order and they are not required to makeminimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. Because the marketsin which we compete are highly competitive and some of our competitors havegreater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continueto be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for ourproducts and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidtechnological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and priceerosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannotbe sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products andservices will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and servicesin the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could resultin erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, andcould have a negative impact on our financial condition and results ofoperations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financialresources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to competesuccessfully. Information about theCompanys competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report onForm 10-K under the heading COMPETITION. 6Our business issubject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operatingresults to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile. Our quarterly and annualoperating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly inthe future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of ourcontrol. Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operatingresults include:●the timing and      amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or      services; ●our ability to      develop, introduce, ship and support new products and product enhancements      and manage product transitions;  ●announcements of new      product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products      and services offered by our competitors; ●our ability to      achieve cost reductions; ●our ability to obtain      sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our      products; ●our ability to      achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our      products;  ●our ability to      maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channels      through which they are sold;  ●the loss of any one      of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those      customers; ●increased      competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized      competitors; ●fluctuations in      demand for our products and services; and  ●changes in      telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and      economic conditions generally. Due in part to factors suchas the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and productavailability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to theend of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter mayadversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delaydelivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and otherfactors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could varysignificantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not berelied upon as indications of future performance.Because some of ourcomponents, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased fromsole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject tounexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key componentsare complex to manufacture and have long lead times. In the event of a reductionor interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to sixmonths to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any.As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and profitabilitycould suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component partsthan is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meetcustomer demand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and wecould lose market share. Any of these events could have a material adverseeffect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.If we do not meetproduct introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we haveexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existingcustomers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on theaddition of new product features. In the past, we have experienced delays inintroducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have todevelop different versions of existing products that comply with diverse, new orvarying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop newproducts or product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new productsor product features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect ourbusiness.7Dependence oncontract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supplychain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage ourreputation and adversely affect our results of operations. We operate a primarilyoutsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes contract manufacturers. Wedepend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturingcapacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality atacceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. Insuch circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail tomeet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment ofsignificant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline,which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Any substantial disruption in our contract manufacturers supply asa result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability,equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customerrelationships and results of operations.If demand for ourproducts and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficultto manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross marginsand profitability. Our cost structure is basedin part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly thoserelating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may makeit difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. Ifdemand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reducethese fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A suddendownturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsoleteif products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newerproducts and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be furtherconstrained because we must continue to invest in research and development tomaintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for ourexisting customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we mayincur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procurescarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costscould reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these resultscould adversely affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. Because we currentlysell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and servicesin countries other than the United States, we are subject to differentregulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services thatcomply with the standards of different countries, which could result in ourinability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political,economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result inreduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect ourbusiness. If our sales are to grow inthe longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Manycountries require communications equipment used in their country to comply withunique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocationschemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with differentstandards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in thoselocations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than weanticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have notcompleted their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not knowthe standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standardsand regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate orcomply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will beadversely affected. Sales to customers outsidethe U.S. accounted for 26%, 17% and 21% of our total sales for fiscal years2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell ourproducts and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will besubject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries orjurisdictions other than the U.S., including those in Latin America, Africa, theMiddle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade betweenthe countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes inexchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries,or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition ofthese countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products to decrease,or subject us to increased regulation including future import and exportrestrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, a substantialportion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procuredfrom foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysiaand other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policytoward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic orfinancial condition of these countries couldcause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, whichcould adversely affect our business.8Our globaloperations, particularly following our acquisition of LoJack, expose us to risksand challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risksinherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance withinternational and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationaloperations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, laborrelations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and traderestrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as theForeign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws thatprohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerationsto customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a riskthat some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent ornegligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certainformal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws andregulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officersor our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of businessactivities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, orprohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could includeprohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries andcould materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansionefforts, ability to attract and retain employees, business or operating results.Disruptions in globalcredit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our businessand results of operations.There is significantuncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Creditmarket dislocations could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to riseor reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customerdemand for our products if they responded to such credit market dislocations bysuspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since wecurrently generate more than 25% of our revenues outside the United States,fluctuations in foreign currencies can have an impact on demand for our productsfor which the sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars.We may not be able toadequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able tooffer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Our ability to succeed inwireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon ourintellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently relyprimarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentialityprocedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectualproperty. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. Wecurrently hold 66 U.S. patents and 175 foreign patents. As part of ourconfidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with allemployees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite theseprecautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technologywithout authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore,effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limitedin some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rightsmay not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independentlydevelop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or designaround any intellectual property rights we hold.We rely on access tothird-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could bematerially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in thefuture. Many of our hardwaresolutions and services are designed to include third-party intellectualproperty, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating tosuch intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experienceand industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonableterms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available onacceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and,therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed tous. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around apatent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of ourhardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would beable to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results ofoperations.9Our competitors haveor may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardwaresolutions, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which couldimpede our ability to offer our hardware solutions, software and services andotherwise adversely affect us. Third parties may claim that we infringe theirproprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing andselling some of our products and subject us to litigation over intellectualproperty rights or other commercial issues. Several of our competitorshave obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover hardwaresolutions, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offeredby us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents heldby our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a riskof our infringement on such claims by our hardware solutions, software andservices. In addition, patent applications in the United States may beconfidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate theextent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe onfuture patent rights held by others. Even with technology thatwe develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventionsclaimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging inour normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development andthe sale of any of our hardware solutions, software and services. Furthermore,because of rapid technological changes in the MRM and IoT marketplaces, currentextensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possiblethat certain components of our hardware solutions, software, services, andbusiness methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectualproperty rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified thatwe may be infringing such rights. In the highly competitiveand technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation overintellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some thirdparties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) arepursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilizedintellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into underthreat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity,enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of thirdparties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violatedpatents or proprietary rights of third parties. Regardless of merit,responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time-consuming, and often involves complex legal, scientific, and factualquestions, and could divert the attention of our management and technicalpersonnel. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering intosuch licensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be giventhat these licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation willnot occur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, wecould lose our right to develop, manufacture, or market products, productlaunches could be delayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetarydamages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If atemporary or permanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us frommarketing or selling certain hardware solutions, software and services, or asuccessful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to athird party, our financial condition and operating results could be materiallyand adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringingtechnology.Any acquisitions wepursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and resultsof operations. As part of our businessstrategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunitiesthat we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of ourbusiness. In fiscal 2017 we acquired LoJack and we may acquire additionalbusinesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions,we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which couldadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations orshare price: ●use a substantial      portion of our available cash;  ●require a significant      devotion of managements time and resources in the pursuit or consummation      of any acquisition;  ●incur substantial      debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may      adversely affect our liquidity;  ●issue equity or      equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders      percentage ownership;  ●assume contingent      liabilities; and  ●take substantial      charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entailnumerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties inassimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel;unanticipated costs; diversion of managements attention from existingoperations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no priorexperience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existingbusiness or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantialaccounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization ofpurchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially andadversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize theanticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business thebusinesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failureto do so could harm our business and operating results.10Any acquisitions wemake and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing businessrelationships with our suppliers and customers.If we make anyacquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers andcustomers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affectedby the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships.If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, wecould suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers andsuppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We depend to someextent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven businessmodels, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and togrow. If we do not have continuedaccess to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliverservices and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieveprofitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on thenetworks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of theirsystems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchasedfrom third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterruptedservice free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy ourcustomers needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacityor needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase andprofitability could be materially and adversely affected if wireless carrierswere to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existingagreements with the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms.Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, ourcompetitors.Our failure topredict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolvingwireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell newproducts.In our industry, it iscritical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wirelesstechnology standards and that our products comply with these standards inrelevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturingproducts that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure ofour products to comply with any one of these or future applicable standardscould prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consumingengineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wirelessoperators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products,then sales of our new products designed to those standards could be materiallyharmed. Our business could beadversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.Our Wireless Datacombusiness depends upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to ourCompany. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centers andare connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customersand by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes ofdetermining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles and other mobile orfixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to thedevices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised insome way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wirelesstracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages beingincurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of ourcustomers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. Evolving regulationand changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase ourexpenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions wecan offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financialcondition.As Internet commercecontinues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agenciesbecomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because theInternet is a critical component of our SaaS and PaaS business model. Inaddition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other chargesimposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing theInternet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange overthe Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and theviability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.11Evolving regulationrelating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to complianceefforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm ourbusiness and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutionsenable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleetmanagement such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, inthe case of our field service application, includes customer information, jobdata, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of oursolutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user withactionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources,including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and variousstate governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection,distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions,including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation(including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirementsgoverning data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. If our privacy ordata security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, withcurrent or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation,regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws andregulations limit our customers ability to use and share this data, or ourability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet,demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and ourresults of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We may be subject tobreaches of our information technology systems, which could damage ourreputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers access to ourservices.Our business operationsrequire that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property,proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in oursecure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our datacenters and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches andother system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that ourinfrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to besecure. We require user names and passwords in order to access our informationtechnology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies tosecure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, ourinformation technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or otherdisruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used orstored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft ofour, our customers, or our business partners intellectual property,proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. Acybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adverselyaffecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our productsor services. In addition, a cyber attack could result in other negativeconsequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations,increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. We rely upon AmazonWeb Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of orinterference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact ouroperations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.Amazon Web Services (AWS)provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for businessoperations, or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service. Wehave architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize dataprocessing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS. Certain ofthe Companys SaaS platforms and applications are hosted by AWS. Given this,along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to anothercloud service provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWSwould impact our operations and our business would be materially and adverselyimpacted. Some CalAmp productsare subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly andunpredictable. Some CalAmp products aresubject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) regulates many aspects of communication devices, includingradiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices tobe connected to the telecommunication networks. Although CalAmp has obtained therequired FCC and various country approvals for all products it currently sells,there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for futureproducts on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirementsmay change or the Company may not in thefuture be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than theUnited States in which it currently sells its products or in which it may sellits products in the future. 12We may be subject toproduct liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs ofdoing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations. We are subject to a risk ofproduct liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually orallegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or servicesresults, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverageto appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liabilityclaims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance maynot continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Therecan be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend theseclaims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in thefuture. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be,defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of suchproducts. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/orbearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed ourhistorical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. The Companysinability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in its products could havea material adverse effect on the Companys business.Many of the Companysproduct lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials whichare considered to be conflict minerals under the SECs rules. Those rulesrequire public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use ofconflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo andadjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similarrules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect ourcosts, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationshipswith customers and suppliers.Risks Relating to OurConvertible Notes and Indebtedness We may not have theability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertiblenotes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase theconvertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may containlimitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of theconvertible notes.Holders of the $172.5million of 1.625% convertible senior notes due 2020 that we issued in May 2015(the convertible notes) will have the right to require us to repurchase all ora portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental changeat a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertiblenotes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Theconvertible notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Companys commonstock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Companyselection, based on an initial conversion rate of 36.2398 shares of common stockper $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to aninitial conversion price of $27.594 per share of common stock, subject tocustomary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option at anytime prior to November 15, 2019 upon the occurrence of certain events in thefuture, as defined in the Indenture. During the period from November 15, 2019 toMay 13, 2020, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardlessof the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of the convertible notes, unless weelect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion(other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will berequired to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes beingconverted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtainfinancing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the convertiblenotes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notesbeing converted or at their maturity. In addition, our ability torepurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the convertiblenotes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing ourfuture indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the convertible notes at a timewhen the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable onfuture conversions of the convertible notes as required by the indenture wouldconstitute a default under the indenture. A fundamental change under theindenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default underagreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the relatedindebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or graceperiods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness andrepurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.13The conditionalconversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affectour financial condition and operating results.In the event theconditional conversion feature of the convertible notes is triggered, holders ofthe convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at anytime during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect toconvert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversionobligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than payingcash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settlea portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, whichcould adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not electto convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicableaccounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal ofthe convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which wouldresult in a material reduction of our net working capital. The accounting methodfor convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as theconvertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reportedfinancial results.Accounting StandardsCodification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC470-20), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equitycomponents of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) thatmay be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner thatreflects the issuers non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, theequity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in theadditional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidatedbalance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as originalissue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of theconvertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount ofnon-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the currentand future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discountedcarrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the termof the convertible notes. We will report lower net income (or greater netlosses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 will requireinterest to include both the current periods amortization of the original issuediscount and the instruments non-convertible interest rate. This couldadversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, thetrading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertiblenotes. In addition, under certaincircumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments(such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cashare currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of commonstock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are notincluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extentthat the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principalamount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if thenumber of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess,if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be surethat the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use ofthis method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the sharesissuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our dilutedconsolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected. The convertible notehedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our commonstock.In connection with the saleof the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactionswith certain financial institutions that we refer to as the optioncounterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offsetthe potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of convertiblenotes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of theprincipal amount upon conversion of any convertible notes. We also entered intowarrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we soldwarrants for the purchase of our common stock. The warrant transactions couldseparately have a dilutive effect if and to the extent that the market price pershare of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.We have been advised thatthe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify theirinitial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives withrespect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock orother securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturityof the convertible notes (and are likely to do so during any observation periodrelated to a conversion of convertible notes or following any repurchase ofconvertible notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchasedate or otherwise). This activity could suppress or inflate the market price ofour common stock. 14The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties. We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market Future issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons. In May 2015, we issued the convertible notes and, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including:●actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; ●failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance;  ●changes in key management    personnel; ●announcements of technological innovations or      new products by us or our competitors;15●developments in or disputes regarding patents      and proprietary rights; ●proposed and completed acquisitions by us or      our competitors; ●the mix of products and services    sold; ●the timing, placement and fulfillment of      significant orders; ●product and service pricing and    discounts; ●acts of war or terrorism; and ●general economicconditions.Our stock price hasbeen highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.The market price of ourstock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described inthis Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatilityin quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts andour failure to meet market expectations. Over the two-year periodended February 28, 2017, the price of CalAmp common stock as reported on TheNASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a high of $21.82 to a low of $12.13. Thestock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particularcompanies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility havesometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation.If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of managements attention and resources.Lack of expecteddividends may make our stock less attractive as aninvestment.We intend to retain allfuture earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipatepaying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Incertain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market tradingprices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividendpolicy"
15,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2016-04-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe operate in a rapidlychanging environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some ofwhich are beyond our control. The following list describes several risk factorswhich are applicable to our Company and speaks as of the date of this document.These and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows: We do not currentlyhave long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingproducts at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.We generally do not havelong-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with ourcustomers do not currently provide us with any assurance of future sales. Thesecustomers can cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty,they are free to purchase products from our competitors, they may expose us tocompetitive price pressure on each order and they are not required to makeminimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. Because the marketsin which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors havegreater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continueto be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The markets for ourproducts and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidtechnological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and priceerosion. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannotbe sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products andservices will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products and servicesin the markets we serve. Any increase in price or other competition could resultin erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, andcould have a negative impact on our financial condition and results ofoperations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financialresources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to competesuccessfully. Information about theCompanys competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report onForm 10-K under the heading COMPETITION. Our business issubject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operatingresults to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile. Our quarterly and annualoperating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly inthe future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of ourcontrol. Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operatingresults include: ●the timing and      amount, or cancellation or rescheduling, of orders for our products or      services;  ●our ability to      develop, introduce, ship and support new products and product enhancements      and manage product transitions;  ●announcements of new      product and service introductions and reductions in the price of products      and services offered by our competitors; ●our ability to      achieve cost reductions; ●our ability to obtain      sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our      products; ●our ability to      achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our      products;  ●our ability to      maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channels      through which they are sold;  ●the loss of any one      of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those      customers; ●increased      competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized      competitors; ●fluctuations in      demand for our products and services; and ●telecommunications      and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions      generally.7Due in part to factors suchas the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and productavailability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to theend of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter mayadversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delaydelivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and otherfactors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could varysignificantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not berelied upon as indications of future performance. Because some of ourcomponents, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased fromsole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject tounexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key componentsare complex to manufacture and have long lead times. Also, our DBS products aremanufactured by a single subcontractor, and an alternative supply source may notbe readily available. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, ordegradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receivingadequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, productshipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer.Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than isnecessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customerdemand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on theCompanys business, financial condition or results of operations. If we do not meetproduct introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we haveexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existingcustomers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on theaddition of new product features. In the past, we have experienced delays inintroducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in somemarkets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products thatcomply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Ourinability to develop new products or product features on a timely basis, or thefailure of new products or product features to achieve market acceptance, couldadversely affect our business.If demand for ourproducts and services fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficultto manage our business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross marginsand profitability. Our cost structure is basedin part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly thoserelating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products and services may makeit difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. Ifdemand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reducethese fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A suddendownturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsoleteif products and services evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newerproducts and services. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be furtherconstrained because we must continue to invest in research and development tomaintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for ourexisting customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we mayincur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procurescarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costscould reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these resultscould adversely affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. Because we currentlysell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products and servicesin countries other than the United States, we are subject to differentregulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products and services thatcomply with the standards of different countries, which could result in ourinability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political,economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result inreduced sales of our products and services and which could adversely affect ourbusiness. 8If our sales are to grow inthe longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Manycountries require communications equipment used in their country to comply withunique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocationschemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with differentstandards, we will be unable to sell our products and services in thoselocations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than weanticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have notcompleted their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not knowthe standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standardsand regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate orcomply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will beadversely affected. Sales to customers outsidethe U.S. accounted for 17%, 21% and 19% of our total sales for fiscal years2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell ourproducts and services to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will besubject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries orjurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Latin America, Africa, theMiddle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade betweenthe countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes inexchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries,or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition ofthese countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products to decrease,or subject us to increased regulation including future import and exportrestrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, a substantialportion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procuredfrom foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwanand other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policytoward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic orfinancial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supplychain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.Our globaloperations, particularly following our acquisition of LoJack, expose us to risksand challenges associated with conducting business internationally.We face several risksinherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance withinternational and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationaloperations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, laborrelations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and traderestrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as theForeign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other local laws thatprohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerationsto customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a riskthat some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent ornegligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certainformal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws andregulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officersor our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of businessactivities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, andprohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could includeprohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries andcould materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansionefforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and ouroperating results. Disruptions in globalcredit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our businessand results of operations.There is significantuncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Creditmarket dislocations could causeinterest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability ofcredit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products if theyresponded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducingtheir capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 17%of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currenciescan have an impact on our results of operations which are expressed in U.S.dollars. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect profit margins onsales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins onsales of products that include components obtained from suppliers locatedoutside of the United States. We may not be able toadequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able tooffer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Other than in our Satelliteproducts business, which currently does not depend upon patented technology, ourability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in largepart, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. Wecurrently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws,confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protectour intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with onlylimited protection. We currently hold 30 U.S. patents and 6 foreign patents. Aspart of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreementswith all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite theseprecautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technologywithout authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore,effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limitedin some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rightsmay not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independentlydevelop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or designaround any intellectual property rights we hold. 9We rely on access tothird-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could bematerially and adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in thefuture. Many of our hardwaresolutions and services are designed to include third-party intellectualproperty, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating tosuch intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experienceand industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonableterms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available onacceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and,therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed tous. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around apatent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of ourhardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would beable to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results ofoperations. Our competitors haveor may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardwaresolutions, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which couldimpede our ability to offer our hardware solutions, software and services andotherwise adversely affect us. Third parties may claim that we infringe theirproprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of ourproducts and subject us to litigation over intellectual property rights or othercommercial issues. Several of our competitorshave obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover hardwaresolutions, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offeredby us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents heldby our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a riskof our infringement on such claims by our hardware solutions, software andservices. In addition, patent applications in the United States may beconfidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate theextent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe onfuture patent rights held by others. Even with technology thatwe develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventionsclaimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging inour normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development andthe sale of any of our hardware solutions, software and services. Furthermore,because of rapid technological changes in the M2M marketplace, current extensivepatent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible thatcertain components of our hardware solutions, software, services, and businessmethods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual propertyrights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may beinfringing such rights. In the highly competitiveand technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation overintellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some thirdparties (referred to as non-practicing, or patent-assertion, entities) arepursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwise unutilizedintellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into underthreat of continued litigation. These lawsuits relate to the validity,enforceability, and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of thirdparties. We may have to defend ourselves against allegations that we violatedpatents or proprietary rights of third parties. Regardless of merit,responding to such litigation may be costly, unpredictable, time-consuming, andoften involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions, and coulddivert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In certaincases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensingagreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that theselicenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we could loseour right to develop, manufacture, or market products, product launches could bedelayed, or we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages orroyalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. If a temporary orpermanent injunction is granted by a court prohibiting us from marketing orselling certain hardware solutions, software and services or a successful claimof infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, ourfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adverselyaffected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringingtechnology.10For example, we arecurrently engaged in litigation with Omega Patents, LLC (Omega). In December2013, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against the Company by Omega, anon-practicing entity, also known as a patent-assertion entity. Omega allegedthat certain of the Companys vehicle tracking products infringed on certainpatents asserted by Omega. On February 24, 2016, a jury in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Middle District of Florida awarded Omega damages of $2.9 million,for which CalAmp recorded a full accrual for this liability in the fiscal 2016fourth quarter. Following trial, Omega made a motion seeking an injunction andrequesting the court to exercise its discretion to treble damages and assessattorneys fees. The Companys responsive motion is pending, and the judgesruling has not yet been rendered. CalAmp intends to pursue an appeal at theCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In addition to its appeal, CalAmp isseeking to invalidate a number of Omegas patents in actions filed with the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office. While it is not feasible to predict with certaintythe outcome of this litigation, its ultimate resolution could be material tocash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, if an injunction is issued bythe court, we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling a number of ourproducts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to Note 15  LegalProceedings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.Any acquisitions wepursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and resultsof operations. As part of our businessstrategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunitiesthat we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of ourbusiness. In fiscal 2014, we acquired Wireless Matrix and Radio SatelliteIntegrators. In fiscal 2016, we acquired Crashboxx, and subsequent to the end offiscal 2016 we acquired LoJack. We may acquire additional businesses, assets, ortechnologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any orall of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or share price: ●use a substantial      portion of our available cash;  ●require a      significant devotion of managements time and resources in the pursuit or      consummation of any acquisition; ●incur substantial      debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may      adversely affect our liquidity; ●issue equity or      equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders      percentage ownership;  ●assume contingent      liabilities; and  ●take substantial      charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entailnumerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties inassimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel;unanticipated costs; diversion of managements attention from existingoperations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no priorexperience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existingbusiness or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantialaccounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization ofpurchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense,any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results. We may notbe able to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate withour existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel thatwe acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operatingresults. Any acquisitions wemake and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing businessrelationships with our suppliers and customers. If we make anyacquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers andcustomers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affectedby the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships.If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, wecould suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers andsuppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.We depend to someextent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven businessmodels, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and togrow. If we do not have continuedaccess to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliverservices and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieveprofitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on thenetworks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of theirsystems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchasedfrom third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterruptedservice free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy ourcustomers needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacityor needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase andprofitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers wereto significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreementswith the wireless carriers generally have one- to three-year terms. Some ofthese wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors, and if theycompete with us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on theirnetworks. 11Our failure topredict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolvingwireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell newproducts.In our industry, it iscritical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wirelesstechnology standards and that our products comply with these standards inrelevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturingproducts that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure ofour products to comply with any one of these or future applicable standardscould prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consumingengineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wirelessoperators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products,then sales of our new products designed to those standards could be materiallyharmed. Our business could beadversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell. Our MRM and WirelessNetworks businesses depend upon Internet-based systems that are proprietary toour Company. These applications, which are hosted at independent data centersand are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by ourcustomers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices forpurposes of determining location, speed or other conditions of vehicles andother mobile or fixed assets, and to deliver configuration code or executablecommands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed or wereotherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the properfunctioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, andcould result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary orpermanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with thesedevices. Evolving regulationand changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase ourexpenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions wecan offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financialcondition. As Internet commercecontinues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agenciesbecomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because theInternet is a critical component of our SaaS and PaaS business model. Inaddition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other chargesimposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing theInternet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet useor restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a declinein the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, whichcould harm our business. Evolving regulationrelating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to complianceefforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm ourbusiness and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutionsenable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleetmanagement such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, inthe case of our field service application, includes customer information, jobdata, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of oursolutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user withactionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources,including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and variousstate governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection,distribution and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions,including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation(including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirementsgoverning data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. If our privacy ordata security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, withcurrent or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation,regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws andregulations limit our customers ability to use and share this data, or ourability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet,demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and ourresults of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 12We may be subject tobreaches of our information technology systems, which could damage ourreputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers access to ourservices. Our business operationsrequire that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property,proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in oursecure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our datacenters and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches andother system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that ourinfrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to besecure. We require user names and passwords in order to access our informationtechnology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies tosecure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, ourinformation technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or otherdisruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used orstored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft ofour, our customers, or our business partners intellectual property,proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. Acybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adverselyaffecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our productsor services. In addition, a cyber attack could result in other negativeconsequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations,increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Some CalAmp productsare subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly andunpredictable. Some CalAmp products aresubject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal CommunicationsCommission regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiationof electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to beconnected to the telecommunication networks. Although CalAmp has obtained therequired FCC and various country approvals for all products it currently sells,there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for futureproducts on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirementsmay change or the Company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessaryapprovals from countries other than the United States in which it currentlysells its products or in which it may sell its products in the future.We may be subject toproduct liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs ofdoing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations. We are subject to a risk ofproduct liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually orallegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or servicesresults, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverageto appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liabilityclaims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance maynot continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Therecan be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend theseclaims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in thefuture. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be,defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of suchproducts. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/orbearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed ourhistorical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. The Companysinability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in its products could havea material adverse effect on the Companys business.Many of the Companysproduct lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold and other materials whichare considered to be conflict minerals under the SECs rules. Those rulesrequire public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use ofconflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo andadjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similarrules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect ourcosts, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationshipswith customers and suppliers. Risks Relating to OurConvertible Notes and Indebtedness We may still incursubstantially more debt or take other actions that could diminish our ability tomake payments on the convertible notes.We and our subsidiaries maybe able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to therestrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may besecured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governingthe convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing orfuture debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions thatare not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notesthat could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on theconvertible notes when due. 13We may not have theability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertiblenotes in cash, repay the convertible notes at maturity or repurchase theconvertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may containlimitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of theconvertible notes.Holders of the $172.5million of 1.625% convertible senior notes due 2020 that we issued in May 2015(the convertible notes) will have the right to require us to repurchase all ora portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental changeat a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertiblenotes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Theconvertible notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Companys commonstock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Companyselection, based on an initial conversion rate of 36.2398 shares of common stockper $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to aninitial conversion price of $27.594 per share of common stock, subject tocustomary adjustments. Holders may convert their notes at their option at anytime prior to November 15, 2019 upon the occurrence of certain events in thefuture, as defined in the Indenture. During the period from November 15, 2019 toMay 13, 2020, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardlessof the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of the convertible notes, unless weelect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion(other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will berequired to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes beingconverted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtainfinancing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the convertiblenotes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notesbeing converted or at their maturity. In addition, our ability torepurchase or to pay cash upon conversions or at maturity of the convertiblenotes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing ourfuture indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the convertible notes at a timewhen the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable onfuture conversions of the convertible notes as required by the indenture wouldconstitute a default under the indenture. A fundamental change under theindenture or a default under the indenture could also lead to a default underagreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the relatedindebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or graceperiods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness andrepurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.The conditionalconversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affectour financial condition and operating results. In the event theconditional conversion feature of the convertible notes is triggered, holders ofthe convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at anytime during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect toconvert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversionobligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than payingcash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settlea portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, whichcould adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not electto convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicableaccounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal ofthe convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which wouldresult in a material reduction of our net working capital. The accounting methodfor convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as theconvertible notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financialresults. Accounting StandardsCodification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC470-20), requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equitycomponents of convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) thatmay be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner thatreflects the issuers non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, theequity component of the convertible notes is required to be included in theadditional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidatedbalance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as originalissue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of theconvertible notes. As a result, we are required to recognize a greater amount ofnon-cash interest expense in our consolidated income statements in the currentand future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discountedcarrying value of the convertible notes to their principal amount over the termof the convertible notes. We will report lower net income (or greater netlosses) in our consolidated financial results because ASC 470-20 will requireinterest to include both the current periods amortization of the original issuediscount and the instruments non-convertible interest rate. This couldadversely affect our reported or future consolidated financial results, thetrading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertiblenotes. 14In addition, under certaincircumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments(such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cashare currently accounted for utilizing a method in which the shares of commonstock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, are notincluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extentthat the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principalamount. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if thenumber of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess,if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be surethat the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use ofthis method. If we are unable to use this method in accounting for the sharesissuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, if any, then our dilutedconsolidated earnings per share could be adversely affected. The convertible notehedge and warrant transactions may adversely affect the value of our commonstock. In connection with the saleof the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactionswith certain financial institutions that we refer to as the optioncounterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offsetthe potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of convertiblenotes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of theprincipal amount upon conversion of any convertible notes. We also entered intowarrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we soldwarrants for the purchase of our common stock. The warrant transactions couldseparately have a dilutive effect if and to the extent that the market price pershare of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.We have been advised thatthe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify theirinitial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives withrespect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock orother securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturityof the convertible notes (and are likely to do so during any observation periodrelated to a conversion of convertible notes or following any repurchase ofconvertible notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchasedate or otherwise). This activity could suppress or inflate the market price ofour common stock. The effect, if any, ofthese activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price ofour common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including marketconditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activitiescould, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and thetrading price of the convertible notes. We are subject tocounterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedgetransactions.The option counterpartiesare financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we willbe subject to the risk that one or more option counterparties may default underthe convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of theoption counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of theoption counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will becomean unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure atthe time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but,generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase inthe market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market priceof our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stabilityor viability of any of the option counterparties. Risks Relating to OurCommon Stock and the Securities Market Future issuances ofshares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of ourstockholders. Any issuance of equitysecurities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and couldsubstantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issueequity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to financeour operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions,strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt toequity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options orfor other reasons. In May 2015, we issued the convertible notes and, to theextent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes, thatconversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. 15Anti-takeoverdefenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from beingacquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for ourcommon stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the DelawareGeneral Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three yearsfrom the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specificconditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections whichwould make it difficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without theapproval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignatedpreferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations andother actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing couldhinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price thatinvestors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.The trading price ofshares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price ofshares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly tradedcompany, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly inthe past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and couldbe subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors,including:●actual or anticipated fluctuations in      revenues or operating results; ●failure to meet      securities analysts or investors expectations of      performance; ●changes in key      management personnel; ●announcements of      technological innovations or new products by us or our      competitors; ●developments in or      disputes regarding patents and proprietary  rights; ●proposed and      completed acquisitions by us or ourcompetitors; ●the mix of products      and services sold; ●the timing, placement      and fulfillment of significant orders; ●product and service      pricing and discounts; ●acts of war or      terrorism; and ●general economic      conditions.Our stock price hasbeen highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.The market price of ourstock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described inthis Annual Report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatilityin quarterly revenues and earnings due to comments by securities analysts andour failure to meet market expectations. Over the two-year periodended February 28, 2016, the price of CalAmp common stock as reported on TheNASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a high of $34.85 to a low of $14.01. Thestock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particularcompanies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility havesometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation.If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Lack of expecteddividends may make our stock less attractive as aninvestment.We intend to retain allfuture earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipatepaying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Incertain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market tradingprices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividendpolicy. 16Risks Relating to theLoJack Acquisition We may be unable tosuccessfully integrate LoJacks business and realize the anticipated benefits ofthe acquisition. We will be required todevote significant management attention and resources to integrating thebusiness practices and operations of LoJack into our company. Prior to theacquisition, LoJack operated independently, with its own business, corporateculture, locations, employees, and systems. Potential difficulties that we mayencounter in the integration process include the following: ●the inability to combine the businesses of LoJack with      CalAmps pre-existing operations in a manner that permits us to achieve      the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition, including cost savings      and other synergies; ●distracting management from day-to-day      operations; ●potential incompatibility of corporatecultures; ●lost sales if customers of either LoJack or CalAmp decide      not to do business with us; ●the failure to retain key employees of either LoJack or      us; ●potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased      expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with the acquisition;      and ●difficulties in applying our operating and administrative      control policies and procedures to LoJack.For all these reasons, itis possible that the integration process following the LoJack acquisition coulddivert managements attention, disrupt our ongoing business, or otherwise proveunsuccessful. Any such issues could adversely affect our ability to maintainrelationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve theanticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results. We expect to continueto incur transaction and integration expenses related to the LoJack acquisition.We expect to continue toincur certain expenses in connection with integrating LoJacks operations,policies and procedures with ours, some of which may be significant. While wehave assumed that a certain amount of transaction and integration expenses willbe incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affectthe total amount or the timing of these expenses"
8,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2015-04-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following list describes several risk factors which are applicable to our Company: The Company has two significant customers, the loss of either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys future sales and its ability to grow. EchoStar accounted for 15% of the Companys consolidated revenues for fiscal 2015, and a major original equipment manufacturer in the heavy equipment industry accounted for 11% of the Companys consolidated revenues in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter. The loss of EchoStar or the heavy equipment OEM as a customer, a deterioration in either customers overall business, or a decrease in either customers volume of sales, could result in decreased sales for us and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow our business. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from these key customers could result in write-offs or in the loss of future business and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products from our competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and they are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.  6Because the marketsin which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors havegreater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continueto be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.The market for our productsis intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change,evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expectcompetition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offerings andnew competitors enter the market. Given the highly competitive environment inwhich we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currentlyenjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establish and sustain our productsin the market. Any increase in price or other competition could result inerosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, andcould have a negative impact on our financial condition and results ofoperations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financialresources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to competesuccessfully. Information about theCompanys competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report onForm 10-K under the heading COMPETITION. Our business issubject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operatingresults to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile. Our quarterly and annualoperating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly inthe future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of ourcontrol. Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operatingresults include: ●the timing and amount of, or cancellation or      rescheduling of, orders for our products; ●our ability to develop, introduce, ship and      support new products and product enhancements and manage product      transitions; ●announcements, new product introductions and      reductions in the price of products offered by our    competitors; ●our ability to achieve cost    reductions; ●our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of      sole or limited source components for our products; ●our ability to achieve and maintain production      volumes and quality levels for our products; ●our ability to maintain the volume of products      sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are    sold; ●the loss of any one of our major customers or a      significant reduction in orders from those customers; ●increased competition, particularly from      larger, better capitalized competitors; ●fluctuations in demand for our products and      services; and ●telecommunications and wireless market      conditions specifically and economic conditionsgenerally.Due in part to factors suchas the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and productavailability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to theend of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter mayadversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delaydelivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and otherfactors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could varysignificantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not berelied upon as indications of future performance. 7Because some of ourcomponents, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased fromsole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject tounexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key componentsare complex to manufacture and have long lead times. Also, our DBS products aremanufactured by a single subcontractor, and an alternative supply source may notbe readily available. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, ordegradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receivingadequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, productshipments could be delayed and revenues and profitability could suffer.Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than isnecessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customerdemand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on theCompanys business, financial condition or results of operations. If we do not meetproduct introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we haveexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existingcustomers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on theaddition of new product features. In the past, we have experienced delays inintroducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in somemarkets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products thatoperate at different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varyinggovernmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new productsor product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products or productfeatures to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect ourbusiness.If demand for ourproducts fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage ourbusiness efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins andprofitability. Our cost structure is basedin part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly thoserelating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products may make it difficultto plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand issignificantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixedcosts, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn mayalso leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if productsevolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products. Our ability toreduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue toinvest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and tomaintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in theevent of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expeditedelivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additionalmanufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overallprofitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business,financial condition or results of operations. Because we currentlysell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countriesother than the United States, we are subject to different regulatory policies.We may not be able to develop products that comply with the standards ofdifferent countries, which could result in our inability to sell our productsand, further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditionsaffecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our productsand which could adversely affect our business. If our sales are to grow inthe longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Manycountries require communications equipment used in their country to comply withunique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocationschemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with differentstandards, we will be unable to sell our products in those locations. Ifcompliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, ourbusiness would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed theirradio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standardswith which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatoryrequirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply withthese new standards, our business and results of operations will be adverselyaffected. 8Sales to customers outsidethe U.S. accounted for 21%, 19% and 18% of our total sales for the fiscal yearsended February 28, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Assuming that we continueto sell our products to foreign customers, which is our expectation, we will besubject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries orjurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Latin America, Africa, theMiddle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade betweenthe countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes inexchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries,or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition ofthese countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products to decrease,or subject us to increased regulation including future import and exportrestrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, a substantialportion of our products, components and subassemblies are currently procuredfrom foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan,and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policytoward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic orfinancial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supplychain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.Disruptions in globalcredit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our businessand results of operations.There is significantuncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets. Creditmarket dislocations, including as a result of the Eurozone concerns, could causeinterest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reduce the availability ofcredit, which could negatively affect customer demand for our products if theyresponded to such credit market dislocations by suspending, delaying or reducingtheir capital expenditures. Moreover, since we currently generate more than 20%of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currenciescan have an impact on our results of operations which are expressed in U.S.dollars. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect profit margins onsales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins onsales of products that include components obtained from suppliers locatedoutside of the United States.We may not be able toadequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able tooffer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Other than in our Satelliteproducts business, which currently does not depend upon patented technology, ourability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in largepart, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. Wecurrently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws,confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protectour intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with onlylimited protection. We currently hold 31 patents. As part of our confidentialityprocedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with all employees,including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, thirdparties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology withoutauthorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore,effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limitedin some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rightsmay not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independentlydevelop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or designaround any intellectual property rights we hold. We rely on access tothird-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could bematerially adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in thefuture. Many of our hardwaresolutions and services are designed to include third-party intellectualproperty, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating tosuch intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experienceand industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonableterms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available onacceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and,therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed tous. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around apatent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable to sell some of ourhardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would beable to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.9Our competitors haveor may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardwaresolutions, software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which couldimpede our ability to offer our hardware solutions, software and services andotherwise adversely affect us. We may, from time to time, also be subject tolitigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.Several of our competitorshave obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover hardwaresolutions, software and services directly or indirectly related to those offeredby us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all existing patents heldby our competitors or other third parties containing claims that may pose a riskof our infringement on such claims by our hardware solutions, software andservices. In addition, patent applications in the United States may beconfidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate theextent to which our hardware solutions, software and services may infringe onfuture patent rights held by others.Even with technology thatwe develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventionsclaimed by their patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging inour normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development andthe sale of any of our hardware solutions, software and services. Furthermore,because of rapid technological changes in the M2M marketplace, current extensivepatent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible thatcertain components of our hardware solutions, software, services, and businessmethods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual propertyrights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may beinfringing such rights.In the highly competitiveand technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation overintellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some thirdparties are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal of monetizing otherwiseunutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements enteredinto under threat of continued litigation. Regardless of merit, responding tosuch litigation can consume significant time and expense. In certain cases, wemay consider the desirability of entering into such licensing agreements orarrangements, although no assurance can be given that these licenses can beobtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are foundto be infringing any intellectual property rights, we may be required to paysubstantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibitingus from marketing or selling certain hardware solutions, software and servicesor a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties toa third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materiallyadversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringingtechnology. While in managements opinion we do not have a potential liabilityfor damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claimsrelated to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights thatwould individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition and operating results, the results of such potential claimscannot be predicted with certainty. In any potential matters related toinfringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others, orshould several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reportingperiod, our financial condition and operating results could be materiallyadversely affected.Any acquisitions wepursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and resultsof operations.As part of our businessstrategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunitiesthat we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of ourbusiness. In fiscal 2014, we completed our acquisition of Wireless Matrix andRadio Satellite Integrators. We may acquire additional businesses, assets, ortechnologies in the future. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any orall of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or share price: ●use a substantial      portion of our available cash; ●require a significant devotion of      managements time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of any      acquisition; ●incur substantial      debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may      adversely affect our liquidity; ●issue equity or      equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders      percentage ownership;  ●assume contingent      liabilities; and  ●take substantial      charges in connection with acquired assets.Acquisitions also entailnumerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties inassimilating acquired operations, products, technologies, and personnel;unanticipated costs; diversion of managements attention from existingoperations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no priorexperience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existingbusiness or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantialaccounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization ofpurchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense,any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results. We may notbe able to realize the anticipated benefitsof or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses,products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do socould harm our business and operating results.10Any acquisitions wemake and industry consolidation could adversely affect our existing businessrelationships with our suppliers and customers. If we make anyacquisitions, our existing business relationships with our suppliers andcustomers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry is being affectedby the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategic relationships.If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, wecould suffer a reduction in the volume of business with our customers andsuppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.The finite amount ofradio frequency spectrum may restrict the growth of the wireless communicationsindustry and demand for our products. Radio frequencies arerequired to provide wireless services. Industry growth has been and may continueto be affected by the availability of licenses required to use frequencies andrelated costs. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United Statesand other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocatedto the various wireless services. The growth of the wireless communicationsindustry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or,alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to better utilize thefrequencies currently allocated for such use. We depend to someextent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven businessmodels, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and togrow. If we do not have continuedaccess to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliverservices and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieveprofitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on thenetworks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of theirsystems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchasedfrom third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterruptedservice free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy ourcustomers needs if such third parties failed to provide the required capacityor needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase andprofitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers wereto significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreementswith the wireless carriers generally have one to three-year terms. Some of thesewireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors, and if they competewith us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on their networks.Our failure topredict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolvingwireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell newproducts.In our industry, it iscritical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wirelesstechnology standards and that our products comply with these standards inrelevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturingproducts that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure ofour products to comply with any one of these or future applicable standardscould prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consumingengineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wirelessoperators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products,then sales of our new products designed to those standards could be materiallyharmed. Our business could beadversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell. Our MRM business dependsupon Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our Company. Theseapplications, which are hosted by an independent data center and are connectedvia access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us toconfigure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determininglocation, speed or other conditions, and to deliver configuration code orexecutable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed orwere otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the properfunctioning of the wireless tracking andmonitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages being incurred byus as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers towirelessly communicate with these devices. 11Evolving regulationand changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase ourexpenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions wecan offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financialcondition. As Internet commercecontinues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agenciesbecomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because theInternet is a critical component of our SaaS and PaaS business model. Inaddition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other chargesimposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing theInternet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet useor restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a declinein the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, whichcould harm our business. Evolving regulationrelating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to complianceefforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm ourbusiness and adversely affect our financial condition.Our products and solutionsenable us to collect, manage, and store a wide range of data related to fleetmanagement such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, inthe case of our field service application, includes customer information, jobdata, schedule, invoice and other information. A valuable component of oursolutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user withactionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources,including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and variousstate governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection,distribution, and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions,including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation(including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirementsgoverning data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. If our privacy ordata security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, withcurrent or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation,regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws andregulations limit our customers ability to use and share this data, or ourability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet,demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and ourresults of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We may be subject tobreaches of our information technology systems, which could damage ourreputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers access to ourservices. Our business operationsrequire that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property,proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in oursecure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our datacenters and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches andother system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that ourinfrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to besecure. We require user names and passwords in order to access our informationtechnology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies tosecure the transmission and storage of data. Despite our security measures, ourinformation technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or otherdisruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used orstored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft ofour, our customers, or our business partners intellectual property,proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. Acybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adverselyaffecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our productsor services. In addition, a cyber attack could result in other negativeconsequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations,increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Some CalAmp productsare subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly andunpredictable. Some CalAmp products aresubject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal CommunicationsCommission regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy,biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telecommunicationnetworks. Although CalAmp has obtained the required FCC and various countryapprovals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance thatsuch approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all.In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or the Company may not inthe future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other thanthe United States in which it currently sells its products or in which it maysell its products in the future. 12We may be subject toproduct liability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs ofdoing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations. We are subject to a risk ofproduct liability or warranty claims if our products or services actually orallegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products or servicesresults, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverageto appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liabilityclaims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance maynot continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Therecan be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend theseclaims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in thefuture. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be,defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of suchproducts. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/orbearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed ourhistorical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. Reduced consumer orcorporate spending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 andother uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and couldcontinue to adversely affect our revenues and cash flow. We depend on demand fromthe consumer, original equipment manufacturer, industrial, automotive and othermarkets we serve for the end market applications of our products and services.Our revenues are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. Ifthe significant reductions in consumer or corporate spending as a result ofuncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment continue, our revenues,profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected. The Companysinability to identify the origin of conflict minerals in its products could havea material adverse effect on the Companys business.Many of the Companysproduct lines include tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold, and other materials whichare considered to be conflict minerals under the SECs rules. Those rulesrequire public reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use ofconflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo andadjoining countries in the manufacture of products. Those rules, or similarrules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect ourcosts, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationshipswith customers and suppliers. Risks Relating to OurCommon Stock and the Securities Market Anti-takeoverdefenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from beingacquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for ourcommon stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the DelawareGeneral Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in anybusiness combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three yearsfrom the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specificconditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections whichwould make it difficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without theapproval of our Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignatedpreferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations andother actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing couldhinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price thatinvestors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.13The trading price ofshares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price ofshares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly tradedcompany, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly inthe past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and couldbe subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors,including:●actual or anticipated fluctuations in      revenues or operating results;  ●failure to meet securities analysts or      investors expectations of performance;  ●changes in key management personnel;       ●announcements of technological innovations      or new products by us or our competitors;  ●developments in or disputes regarding      patents and proprietary rights;  ●proposed and completed acquisitions by us or      our competitors;  ●the mix of products      and services sold;  ●the timing, placement and fulfillment of      significant orders;  ●product and service pricing and discounts;       ●acts of war or terrorism; and       ●general      economic conditions.Our stock price hasbeen highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.The market price of ourstock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described inthis Annual Report, as well as other factors, including: ●substantial volatility in quarterly revenues      and earnings due to our current dependence on a small number of      significant customers; ●comments by securities analysts;      and ●our failure to meet market      expectations.Over the two-year periodended February 28, 2015, the price of CalAmp common stock as reported on TheNASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a high of $34.85 to a low of $9.26. Thestock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particularcompanies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility havesometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation.If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of managements attention and resources.Lack of expecteddividends may make our stock less attractive as aninvestment.We intend to retain allfuture earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipatepaying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Incertain cases, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market tradingprices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividendpolicy"
5,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2014-04-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    The following list describes several risk factors which are applicable toour Company: The Company is dependent on asignificant customer, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect onthe Companys future sales and its ability to grow.     EchoStar accounted for 20.7% of the Companys consolidated revenues forfiscal 2014. The loss of EchoStar as a customer, a deterioration in its overallbusiness, or a decrease in its volume of sales, could result in decreased salesfor us and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow ourbusiness. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from this keycustomer could result in write-offs or in the loss of future business and couldhave a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. We do not currently havelong-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingproducts at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.    We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with anyassurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products from usat any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products from ourcompetitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order andthey are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken byour customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,financial condition or results of operations. Because the markets in which wecompete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greaterresources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continue to beaccepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.    The market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized byrapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, andprice erosion. We expect competition to intensify as our competitors expandtheir product offerings and new competitors enter the market. Given the highlycompetitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that anycompetitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient toestablish and sustain our products in the market.Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our marketshare, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negativeimpact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provideassurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise ormarketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. 6     Informationabout the Companys competitors is included in Part I, Item 1 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"". Our business is subject to manyfactors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuateand our stock price to be volatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, manyof which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could affect ourquarterly or annual operating results include:the timing and  amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, orders for our  products; our ability to develop, introduce, ship and  support new products and product enhancements and manage product  transitions; announcements, new product introductions and  reductions in the price of products offered by our  competitors; our ability to achieve cost  reductions; our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole  or limited source components for our products; our ability to achieve and maintain production  volumes and quality levels for our products; our ability to maintain the volume of products  sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are  sold; the loss of any one of our major customers or a  significant reduction in orders from those customers; increased competition, particularly from larger,  better capitalized competitors; fluctuations in demand for our products and  services; and telecommunications and wireless market conditions  specifically and economic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In thefuture, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expensesand results of operations could vary significantly in the future, andperiod-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of futureperformance. Because some of our components,assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole sourcesuppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpectedinterruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.    Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes. Also, our DBS products are manufactured by a single subcontractor, and analternative supply source may not be readily available. In the event of areduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take upto six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers,if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues andprofitability could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation ofcomponent parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantitiessufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competingproducts and we could lose market share. Any ofthese events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,financial condition or results of operations. 7If we do not meet productintroduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.     In the past,we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existingcustomers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on theaddition of new product features. In the past, we have experienced delays inintroducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in somemarkets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products thatoperate at different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varyinggovernmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new productsor product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products or productfeatures to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect ourbusiness.If demand for our productsfluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage the businessefficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.    Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for futuredemand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts indemand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacity andbusiness operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations,we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish grossmargins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excessinventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products evolve during the downturnand demand shifts to newer products. Our ability to reduce costs and expensesmay be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research anddevelopment to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service andsupport for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a suddenupturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery ofcomponents, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturingprocesses. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability.Any of these results could adversely affect our business. Because we currently sell, and weintend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countries other than theUnited States, we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not beable to develop products that comply with the standards of different countries,which could result in our inability to sell our products and, further, we may besubject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries,which could result in reduced sales of our products and which could adverselyaffect our business.     If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow ourinternational business. Many countries require communications equipment used intheir country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations,radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop productsthat work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products inthose locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consumingthan we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countrieshave not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we donot know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore,standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail toanticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results ofoperations will be adversely affected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 19%, 18% and 11% of ourtotal sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2014, 2013 and 2012,respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products to foreigncustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including in LatinAmerica, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption orcurtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our presenttrading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. tradepolicy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political,economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for andsales of our products to decrease, or subject us to increased regulationincluding future import and export restrictions, any of which could adverselyaffect our business.     Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components andsubassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily inHong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries. Anysignificant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significantdownturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chainor otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.8Disruptions in global credit andfinancial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.     There issignificant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financialmarkets. Credit market dislocations, including as a result of the Eurozoneconcerns, could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to rise or reducethe availability of credit, which could negatively affect customer demand forour products if they responded to such credit market dislocations by suspending,delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since we generatemore than 10% of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuations in foreigncurrencies can have an impact on our results of operations which are expressedin U.S. dollars. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect profitmargins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States andmargins on sales of products that include components obtained from supplierslocated outside of the United States.We may not be able to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offersimilar products and services that would harm our competitive position.    Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does notdepend upon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless datacommunications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual propertyfor some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents,trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractualprovisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, thesemechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 32patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosureagreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers.Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, or develop similar technologyindependently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rightsis unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of ourintellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should ourcompetitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products andservices, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold. We rely on access to third-partypatents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materiallyadversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.    Many of our hardware solutions and services are designed to includethird-party intellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek orrenew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that,based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can beobtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenseswould be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may benonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the sametechnology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unableto design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable tosell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurancethat we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies,without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations. Our competitors have or mayobtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardware solutions,software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede ourability to offer our hardware solutions, software and services and otherwiseadversely affect us. We may, from time to time, also be subject to litigationover intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.    Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtainpatents that cover hardware solutions, software and services directly orindirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we areaware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third partiescontaining claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by ourhardware solutions, software and services. In addition, patent applications inthe United States may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly,we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software andservices may infringe on future patent rights held by others.     Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party mayclaim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiatelitigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities,such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our hardwaresolutions, software and services. Furthermore, because of technological changesin the M2M industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuanceof new patents, it is possible that certaincomponents of our hardware solutions, software, services, and business methodsmay unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights ofthird parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may beinfringing such rights. 9     In the highlycompetitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular,litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, andsome third parties are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal ofmonetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensingarrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. Regardless ofmerit, responding to such litigation can consume significant time and expense.In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into suchlicensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given thatthese licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will notoccur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we maybe required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanentinjunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain hardware solutions,software and services or a successful claim of infringement against us requiresus to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operatingresults could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether we candevelop non-infringing technology. While in managements opinion we do not havea potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legalproceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or otherintellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, theresults of such potential claims cannot be predicted with certainty. In anypotential matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectualproperty rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved againstus in the same reporting period, our financial condition and operating resultscould be materially adversely affected. Any acquisitions we make coulddisrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results ofoperations.    As part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue toreview acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous orcomplementary to the development of our business. In fiscal 2014, we completedour acquisition of Wireless Matrix and Radio Satellite Integrators. We mayacquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. If we makeany acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one ofwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations or share price: use a substantial portion of our available  cash; incur substantial debt, which may not be available  to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our  liquidity; issue equity or equity-based securities that would  dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership; assume contingent liabilities;  and take substantial charges in connection with  acquired assets.     Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, withoutlimitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products,technologies, and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of managementsattention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we havelimited or no prior experience; and potential loss of key employees from eitherour existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result insubstantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses,amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-basedcompensation expense, any of which could materially adversely affect ouroperating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of orsuccessfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products,technologies or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harmour business and operating results.Any acquisitions we make andindustry consolidation could adversely affect our existing businessrelationships with our suppliers and customers.     If we make any acquisitions, our existing business relationships with oursuppliers and customers could be adversely affected. Moreover, our industry isbeing affected by the trend toward consolidation and the creation of strategicrelationships. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changingenvironment, we could suffer a reduction in the volume of business with ourcustomers and suppliers, or we could lose customers or suppliers entirely, whichcould materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operatingresults. 10The finite amount of radiofrequency spectrum may restrict the growth of the wireless communicationsindustry and demand for our products.      Radiofrequencies are required to provide wireless services. Industry growth has beenand may continue to be affected by the availability of licenses required to usefrequencies and related costs. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in theUnited States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrumspace is allocated to the various wireless services. The growth of the wirelesscommunications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are notallocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to betterutilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use. We depend to some extent uponwireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, andemerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.    If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Ourability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buysufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliabilityand security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered usingairtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties toprovide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be ableto satisfy our customers needs if such third parties failed to provide therequired capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses wouldincrease and profitability could be materially adversely affected if wirelesscarriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Ourexisting agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one to three-yearterms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become our competitors, andif they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on theirnetworks. Our failure to predict carrierand end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industrystandards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell newproducts.    In our industry, it is critical to our success that we accuratelyanticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products complywith these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused onengineering and manufacturing products that comply with several differentwireless standards. Any failure of our products to comply with any one of theseor future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction andrequire costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if aninsufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards towhich we engineer our products, then sales of our new products designed to thosestandards could be materially harmed. Our business could be adverselyimpacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.     Our MRM business depends upon several Internet-based systems that areproprietary to our Company. These applications, which are hosted by anindependent data center and are connected via access points to cellularnetworks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate withwireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or otherconditions, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to thedevices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised insome way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wirelesstracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages beingincurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of ourcustomers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. Evolving regulation and changesin applicable laws relating to the Internet may increase our expendituresrelated to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer,which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.    As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increased regulation byfederal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularlysensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of ourSaaS and PaaS business model. In addition, taxation of services provided overthe Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by privateorganizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposinggreater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over theInternet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viabilityof Internet-based services, which could harm our business. 11Evolving regulation relating todata privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts orotherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business andadversely affect our financial condition.     Our products and solutions enable usto collect, manage, and store a wide range of data related to fleet managementsuch as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage and, in the case ofour field service application, includes customer information, job data,schedule, and invoice, and other information. A valuable component of oursolutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user withactionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources,including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and variousstate governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection,distribution, and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions,including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation(including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirementsgoverning data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. If our privacy ordata security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, withcurrent or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation,regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws andregulations limit our customers ability to use and share this data, or ourability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet,demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and ourresults of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We may be subject to breaches ofour information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor,and customer relationships, and our customers access to ourservices.      Our business operations require thatwe use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietarybusiness information and personally identifiable information, in our secure datacenters and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers andnetworks of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions.It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secureand is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. We require user namesand passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also useencryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission andstorage of data. Despite our security measures, our information technologysystems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems.Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on ournetworks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, ourcustomers, or our business partners intellectual property, proprietarybusiness information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecuritybreach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting themarkets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.In addition, a cyber attack could result in other negative consequences,including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increasedcybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Some CalAmp products are subjectto mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries thatare subject to change, which could make compliance costly and unpredictable.     Some CalAmp products are subject tocertain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States, Canada and othercountries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) regulates many aspects of communication devices, includingradiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices tobe connected to the telephone network. In Canada, similar regulations areadministered by Industry Canada. Although CalAmp has obtained the required FCCand Industry Canada approvals for all products it currently sells, there can beno assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timelybasis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or theCompany may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals fromcountries other than Canada or the United States in which it currently sells itsproducts or in which it may sell its products in the future. We may be subject to productliability, warranty and recall claims that may increase the costs of doingbusiness and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.      We are subject to a risk of productliability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedlyfail to perform as expected or the use of our products or services results, orare alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While wemaintain what we believe to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage toappropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liabilityclaims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance maynot continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Therecan be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to defend theseclaims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in thefuture. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be,defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of suchproducts. Individual quarters were above or below the annual averages. Thefuture cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the costof repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experienceand have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. 12Reduced consumer or corporatespending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and otheruncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and could continueto adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.      We depend on demand from theconsumer, original equipment manufacturer, industrial, automotive and othermarkets we serve for the end market applications of our products and services.Our revenues are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. Ifthe significant reductions in consumer or corporate spending as a result ofuncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment continue, our revenues,profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected. Rises in interest rates couldadversely affect our financial condition.      An increase in prevailing interestrates could have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on ourvariable rate bank debt with Square 1 Bank, which rise and fall upon changes ininterest rates on a periodic basis. Any increased interest expense associatedwith increases in interest rates affects our profitability and cash flow.The Companys inability toidentify the origin of conflict minerals in its products could have a materialadverse effect on the Companys business.     Many of the Companys product linesinclude tantalum, tungsten, tin and other materials which are considered to beconflict minerals under the SECs recently-adopted rules. Those rules requirepublic reporting companies to provide disclosure regarding the use of conflictminerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoiningcountries in the manufacture of products. We are currently working with ourvendors to determine the sourcing of all product components and will endeavor toavoid the utilization of conflict minerals sourced from the DRC and adjoiningcountries in our products. Until we complete our sourcing review with all of ourvendors, we cannot provide complete assurances regarding the country of originfor the components used in our products. If we cannot guarantee that allproducts exclude conflict minerals sourced from the DRC, certain of ourcustomers may discontinue, or materially reduce, purchases of the Companysproducts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Common Stockand the Securities Market Anti-takeover defenses in ourcharter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit theprice that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in anacquisition.     Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any businesscombination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from thetime the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions aremet. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make itdifficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without the approval ofour Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stockand provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actionsto be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay orprevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might bewilling to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The trading price of shares ofour common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of ourcommon stock could decline.     As a publicly traded company, thetrading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. Thefuture trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject towide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including:actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating  results;   failure to meet securities analysts or investors expectations of  performance;   changes in key management personnel;   announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our  competitors; 13developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary  rights;   proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;   the mix of products and services sold;   the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;   product and service pricing and discounts;   acts of war or terrorism; and   general economic conditions. Our stock price has been highlyvolatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.     The market price of our stock can behighly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as wellas other factors, including: substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to our  current dependence on a small number of major customers;   comments by securities analysts; and   our failure to meet market expectations.      Over the two-year period endedFebruary 28, 2014, the price of CalAmp common stock as reported on The NasdaqStock Market ranged from a high of $33.59 to a low of $4.14. The stock markethas from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations thatwere unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In thepast, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequentlybecome the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation wereinstituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversionof managements attention and resources.Lack of expected dividends maymake our stock less attractive as an investment.     We intend to retain all futureearnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate payingany cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Generally,stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and soour stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy"
14,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2013-04-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    The following list describes several risk factors which are applicable toour Company: The Company is dependent on asignificant customer, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect onthe Companys future sales and its ability to grow.     EchoStar accounted for 22% of the Companys consolidated revenues forfiscal 2013. The loss of EchoStar as a customer, a deterioration in its overallbusiness, or a decrease in its volume of sales, could result in decreased salesfor us and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow ourbusiness. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from this keycustomer could result in write-offs or in the loss of future business and couldhave a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. We do not currently havelong-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingproducts at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.    We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with anyassurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products from usat any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products from ourcompetitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order andthey are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken byour customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,financial condition or results of operations. 6Because the markets in which wecompete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greaterresources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continue to beaccepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.     The market forour products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technologicalchange, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. Weexpect competition to intensify as our competitors expand their productofferings and new competitors enter the market. Given the highly competitiveenvironment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitiveadvantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establish andsustain our products in the market. Any increase in price or other competitioncould result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtainedmarket share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition andresults of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have thefinancial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilitiesto compete successfully.     Information about the Companys competitors is included in Part I, Item 1of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"". Our business is subject to manyfactors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuateand our stock price to be volatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, manyof which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could affect ourquarterly or annual operating results include:the timing and amount of, or cancellation or  rescheduling of, orders for our products; our ability to develop, introduce, ship and  support new products and product enhancements and manage product  transitions; announcements, new product introductions and  reductions in the price of products offered by our  competitors; our ability to achieve cost reductions;   our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole  or limited source components for our products; our ability to achieve and maintain production  volumes and quality levels for our products; our ability to maintain the volume of products  sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are  sold; the loss of any one of our major customers or a  significant reduction in orders from those customers;  increased competition, particularly from larger,  better capitalized competitors; fluctuations in demand for our products and  services; and  telecommunications and wireless market conditions  specifically and economic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In thefuture, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expensesand results of operations could vary significantly in the future, andperiod-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of futureperformance. 7Because some of our components,assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole sourcesuppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpectedinterruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.     Some of ourkey components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. Also, ourDBS products are manufactured by a single subcontractor, and an alternativesupply source may not be readily available. In the event of a reduction orinterruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to sixmonths to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any.As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and results ofoperations could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation ofcomponent parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantitiessufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competingproducts and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. If we do not meet productintroduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.    In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficultiesthat have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products andenhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, someof our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of ourproducts on the addition of new product features. In the past, we haveexperienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, inorder to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions ofexisting products that operate at different frequencies and comply with diverse,new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to developnew products or product features on a timely basis, or the failure of newproducts or product features to achieve market acceptance, could adverselyaffect our business.If demand for our productsfluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage the businessefficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.    Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for futuredemand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts indemand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacity andbusiness operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations,we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish grossmargins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excessinventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products evolve during the downturnand demand shifts to newer products. Our ability to reduce costs and expensesmay be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research anddevelopment to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service andsupport for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a suddenupturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery ofcomponents, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturingprocesses. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability.Any of these results could adversely affect our business. Because we currently sell, and weintend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countries other than theUnited States, we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not beable to develop products that comply with the standards of different countries,which could result in our inability to sell our products and, further, we may besubject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries,which could result in reduced sales of our products and which could adverselyaffect our business.     If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow ourinternational business. Many countries require communications equipment used intheir country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations,radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop productsthat work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products inthose locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consumingthan we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countrieshave not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we donot know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore,standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail toanticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results ofoperations will be adversely affected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 18%, 11% and 9% ofCalAmps total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2013, 2012 and2011, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products to foreigncustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Africa,the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of tradebetween the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners,changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward thesecountries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financialcondition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our productsto decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import andexport restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.8     Additionally,a substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies arecurrently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong,mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shiftin U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in thepolitical, economic or financial condition of these countries could causedisruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which couldadversely affect our business.Disruptions in global credit andfinancial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.    There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit andfinancial markets. Credit market dislocations, including as a result of theEurozone concerns, could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to riseor reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customerdemand for our products if they responded to such credit market dislocations bysuspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since wegenerate more than 10% of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuationsin foreign currencies can have an impact on our results of operations which areexpressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, currency variations can adversely affectprofit margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the UnitedStates and margins on sales of products that include components obtained fromsuppliers located outside of the United States.We may not be able to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offersimilar products and services that would harm our competitive position.    Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does notdepend upon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless datacommunications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual propertyfor some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents,trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractualprovisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, thesemechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 30patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosureagreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers.Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, or develop similar technologyindependently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rightsis unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of ourintellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should ourcompetitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products andservices, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold. We rely on access to third-partypatents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materiallyadversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.    Many of our hardware solutions and services are designed to includethird-party intellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek orrenew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that,based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can beobtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenseswould be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may benonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the sametechnology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unableto design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable tosell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurancethat we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies,without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations. Our competitors have or mayobtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardware solutions,software and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede ourability to offer our hardware solutions, software and services and otherwiseadversely affect us. We may, from time to time, also be subject to litigationover intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.    Several of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtainpatents that cover hardware solutions, software and services directly orindirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we areaware of all existing patents held by our competitors or other third partiescontaining claims that may pose a risk of our infringement on such claims by ourhardware solutions, software and services. In addition, patent applications inthe United States may be confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly,we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutions, software andservices may infringe on future patent rights held by others.     Even with technology that we develop independently, a third party mayclaim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may initiatelitigation to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities,such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our hardwaresolutions, software and services. Furthermore, because of technological changesin the M2M industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuanceof new patents, it is possible that certain components of our hardwaresolutions, software, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe thepatents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time totime, we have been notified that we may be infringing suchrights. 9     In the highlycompetitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular,litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, andsome third parties are pursuing a litigation strategy with the goal ofmonetizing otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensingarrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. Regardless ofmerit, responding to such litigation can consume significant time and expense.In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into suchlicensing agreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given thatthese licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will notoccur. If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we maybe required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanentinjunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain hardware solutions,software and services or a successful claim of infringement against us requiresus to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operatingresults could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether we candevelop non-infringing technology. While in managements opinion we do not havea potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legalproceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or otherintellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, theresults of such potential claims cannot be predicted with certainty. In anypotential matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectualproperty rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved againstus in the same reporting period, our financial condition and operating resultscould be materially adversely affected. The finite amount of radiofrequency spectrum may restrict the growth of the wireless communicationsindustry and demand for our products.     Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. Industrygrowth has been and may continue to be affected by the availability of licensesrequired to use frequencies and related costs. The allocation of frequencies isregulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world andlimited spectrum space is allocated to the various wireless services. The growthof the wireless communications industry may be affected if adequate frequenciesare not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not developed tobetter utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use. We depend to some extent uponwireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, andemerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.    If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Ourability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buysufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliabilityand security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered usingairtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties toprovide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be ableto satisfy our customers needs if such third parties failed to provide therequired capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses wouldincrease and profitability could be materially adversely affected if wirelesscarriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Ourexisting agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one to three-yearterms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become our competitors, andif they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on theirnetworks. Our business could be adverselyimpacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.     Our MRM business depends upon several Internet-based systems that areproprietary to our Company. These applications, which are hosted by anindependent data center and are connected via access points to cellularnetworks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate withwireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or otherconditions, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to thedevices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised insome way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wirelesstracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages beingincurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of ourcustomers to wirelessly communicate with these devices. 10We may be subject to breaches ofour information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor,and customer relationships, and our customers access to our services.     Our businessoperations require that we use and store personally identifiable information ofour employees and certain customers. We require user names and passwords inorder to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption andauthentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data.These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party securitybreaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or otherirregularity, and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to ourdata or accounts. If a computer security breach affects our systems, it coulddamage our reputation and also expose us to litigation and possible liability,which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition. Some CalAmp products are subjectto mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries thatare subject to change, which could make compliance costly andunpredictable.    Some CalAmp products are subject to certain mandatory regulatoryapprovals in the United States, Canada and other countries in which it operates.In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulatesmany aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagneticenergy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telephonenetwork. In Canada, similar regulations are administered by Industry Canada.Although CalAmp has obtained the required FCC and Industry Canada approvals forall products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvalscan be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition,such regulatory requirements may change or the Company may not in the future beable to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than Canada or theUnited States in which it currently sells its products or in which it may sellits products in the future.We may be subject to productliability, warranty and recall claims, which may increase the costs of doingbusiness and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.     We are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if ourproducts or services actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or theuse of our products results, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/orproperty damage. While we maintain what we believe to be reasonable limits ofinsurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, largeproduct liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limitsand insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms,if at all. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs todefend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability lossesin the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are allegedto be, defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges ofsuch products. In the past five years, our warranty expense has fluctuatedbetween approximately 0.3% and 9.5% of sales on an annual basis. Individualquarters were above or below the annual averages. The future cost associatedwith providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair orreplacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.Reduced consumer or corporatespending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and otheruncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and could continueto adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.     We depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer,industrial, automotive and other markets we serve for the end marketapplications of our products. Our revenues are based on certain levels ofconsumer and corporate spending. If the significant reductions in consumer orcorporate spending as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomicenvironment continue, our revenues, profitability and cash flow could beadversely affected. Rises in interest rates couldadversely affect our financial condition.    An increase in prevailing interest rates could have an immediate effecton the interest rates charged on our variable rate bank debt with Square 1 Bank,which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates on a periodic basis. Anyincreased interest expense associated with increases in interest rates affectsour profitability and cash flow.11Risks Relating to Our Common Stockand the Securities MarketAnti-takeover defenses in ourcharter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit theprice that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in anacquisition.     Section 203 ofthe Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation fromengaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for aperiod of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder,unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place variousprotections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy theCompany without the approval of our Board of Directors, including authorized butundesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of boardnominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of theforegoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit theprice that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of ourcommon stock. The trading price of shares ofour common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of ourcommon stock could decline.    As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock hasfluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our commonstock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations inresponse to such factors, including:actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or  operating results; failure to meet securities analysts or investors  expectations of performance; changes in key management  personnel; announcements of technological innovations or new  products by CalAmp or its competitors; developments in or disputes regarding patents and  proprietary rights; proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our  competitors; the mix of products and services  sold; the timing, placement and fulfillment of  significant orders; product and service pricing and  discounts; acts of war or terrorism; and general economic conditions.Our stock price has been highlyvolatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.    The market price of our stock has been highly volatile due to the risksand uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors,including: substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and  earnings due to our current dependence on a small number of major  customers; comments by securities analysts;  and our failure to meet market expectations.      Over the two-year period ended February 28, 2013, the price of CalAmpcommon stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a high of $11.50to a low of $2.60. The stock market has from time to time experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performanceof particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatilityhave sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class actionlitigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result insubstantial costs and a diversion of managements attention andresources.12Lack of expected dividends maymake our stock less attractive as an investment.     We intend toretain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do notanticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture. Generally, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher markettrading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividendpolicy.Risk Factors
 Relating to theWireless Matrix Acquisition We may be unable to successfullyintegrate Wireless Matrixs business and realize the anticipated benefits of theacquisition.     We will be required to devote significant management attention andresources to integrating the business practices and operations of WirelessMatrix into our company. Potential difficulties that we may encounter in theintegration process include the following:the inability to combine the businesses of  Wireless Matrix and CalAmps pre-existing operations in a manner that permits  us to achieve the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition, including cost  savings and other synergies; lost sales if customers of either Wireless Matrix  or us decide not to do business with us after theacquisition; the failure to retain key employees of either  Wireless Matrix or us; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen  increased expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with the  acquisition; and difficulties in applying our operating and  administrative control policies and procedures to WirelessMatrix.    For all these reasons, it is possible that the integration processfollowing the Wireless Matrix acquisition could divert managements attention,disrupt our ongoing business, or otherwise prove unsuccessful. Any such issuescould adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers,vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition,or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financialresults.We expect to incur transactionand integration expenses related to the Wireless Matrixacquisition.    We expect to incur certain expenses in connection with completing theWireless Matrix acquisition and integrating Wireless Matrixs operations,policies and procedures with ours, some of which may be significant. While wehave assumed that a certain amount of transaction and integration expenses willbe incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affectthe total amount or the timing of these expenses"
9,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2012-04-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The followinglist describes several risk factors which are applicable to our Company:The Company is dependent on asignificant customer, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect onthe Companys future sales and its ability to grow.     EchoStar accounted for 28% of the Companys consolidated revenues forfiscal 2012. The loss of EchoStar as a customer, a deterioration in its overallbusiness, or a decrease in its volume of sales, could result in decreased salesfor us and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow ourbusiness. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from this keycustomer could result in write-offs or in the loss of future business and couldhave a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. We do not currently havelong-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingproducts at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.    We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with anyassurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products from usat any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products from ourcompetitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order andthey are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken byour customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,financial condition or results of operations. Because the markets in which wecompete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greaterresources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continue to beaccepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.    The market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized byrapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, andprice erosion. We expect competition to intensify as our competitors expandtheir product offerings and new competitors enter the market. Given the highlycompetitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that anycompetitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient toestablish and sustain our products in the market. Any increase in price or othercompetition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we haveobtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financialcondition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we willhave the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and supportcapabilities to compete successfully.     Information about the Companys competitors is included Part I, Item 1 ofthis Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"". Our business is subject to manyfactors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuateand our stock price to be volatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, manyof which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could affect ourquarterly or annual operating results include:the timing and amount of, or cancellation or  rescheduling of, orders for our products; our ability to develop, introduce, ship and  support new products and product enhancements and manage product  transitions; announcements, new product introductions and  reductions in the price of products offered by our  competitors; our ability to achieve cost  reductions; our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole  or limited source components for our products; 6our ability to achieve and maintain production  volumes and quality levels for our products; our ability to maintain the volume of products  sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are  sold; the loss of any one of our major customers or a  significant reduction in orders from those customers; increased competition, particularly from larger,  better capitalized competitors; fluctuations in demand for our products and  services; and telecommunications and wireless market conditions  specifically and economic conditions generally.      Due in part tofactors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and productavailability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to theend of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter mayadversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delaydelivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and otherfactors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could varysignificantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not berelied upon as indications of future performance. Because some of our components,assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole sourcesuppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpectedinterruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.    Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes. Also, our DBS products are manufactured by a single subcontractor, and analternative supply source may not be readily available. In the event of areduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take upto six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers,if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and resultsof operations could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation ofcomponent parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantitiessufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competingproducts and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations. If we do not meet productintroduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.    In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficultiesthat have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products andenhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, someof our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of ourproducts on the addition of new product features. In the past, we haveexperienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, inorder to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions ofexisting products that operate at different frequencies and comply with diverse,new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to developnew products or product features on a timely basis, or the failure of newproducts or product features to achieve market acceptance, could adverselyaffect our business.If demand for our productsfluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage the businessefficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.    Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for futuredemand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts indemand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacity andbusiness operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations,we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish grossmargins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excessinventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products evolve during the downturnand demand shifts to newer products. Our ability to reduce costs and expensesmay be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research anddevelopment to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service andsupport for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a suddenupturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery ofcomponents, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturingprocesses. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability.Any of these results could adversely affect our business. 7Because we currently sell, and weintend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countries other than theUnited States, we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not beable to develop products that comply with the standards of different countries,which could result in our inability to sell our products and, further, we may besubject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries,which could result in reduced sales of our products and which could adverselyaffect our business.      If our salesare to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our internationalbusiness. Many countries require communications equipment used in their countryto comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequencyallocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work withdifferent standards, we will be unable to sell our products in those locations.If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate,our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completedtheir radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know thestandards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards andregulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate orcomply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will beadversely affected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 11%, 9% and 7% ofCalAmps total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2012, 2011 and2010, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products to foreigncustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Africa,the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of tradebetween the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners,changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward thesecountries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financialcondition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our productsto decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import andexport restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.    Additionally, a substantial portion of our products, components andsubassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily inHong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries. Anysignificant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significantdownturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countriescould cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations,which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if the Chinesegovernment allows the value of its currency to rise vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar,our product housings and subassemblies that are sourced in China could becomemore expensive, putting pressure on our profit margins. Disruptions in global credit andfinancial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.    There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit andfinancial markets. Credit market dislocations, including as a result of theEurozone concerns, could cause interest rates and the cost of borrowing to riseor reduce the availability of credit, which could negatively affect customerdemand for our products if they responded to such credit market dislocations bysuspending, delaying or reducing their capital expenditures. Moreover, since wegenerate more than 10% of our revenues outside the United States, fluctuationsin foreign currencies can have an impact on our results of operations which areexpressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, currency variations can adversely affectmargins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States andmargins on sales of products that include components obtained from supplierslocated outside of the United States.We may not be able to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offersimilar products and services that would harm our competitive position.    Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does notdepend upon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless datacommunications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual propertyfor some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents,trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractualprovisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, thesemechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 28patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosureagreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers.Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and useour technology without authorization, or develop similar technologyindependently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rightsis unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of ourintellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should ourcompetitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products andservices, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold. 8We rely on access to third-partypatents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materiallyadversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.     Many ofour hardware solutions and services are designed to include third-partyintellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licensesrelating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on pastexperience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained onreasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would beavailable on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may benonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the sametechnology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unableto design around a patent where we do not hold a license, we may be unable tosell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurancethat we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies,without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations. Our competitors have or mayobtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our hardware solutionsand services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our abilityto offer our hardware solutions and services and otherwise adversely affect us.We may, from time to time, also be subject to litigation over intellectualproperty rights or other commercial issues.      Several of our competitors haveobtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover hardware solutions andservices directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be noassurance that we are aware of all existing patents held by our competitors orother third parties containing claims that may pose a risk of our infringementon such claims by our hardware solutions and services. In addition, patentapplications in the United States may be confidential until a patent is issuedand, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our hardware solutionsand services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.      Even with technology that we developindependently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed bytheir patents and may initiate litigation to stop us from engaging in our normaloperations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale ofany of our hardware solutions and services. Furthermore, because oftechnological changes in the machine-to-machine (M2M) industry, currentextensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possiblethat certain components of our hardware solutions, services, and businessmethods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual propertyrights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may beinfringing such rights.      In the highly competitive andtechnology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation overintellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some thirdparties are pursuing a litigation strategy the goal of which is to monetizeotherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangementsentered into under threat of continued litigation. Regardless of merit,responding to such litigation can consume significant time and expense. Incertain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into such licensingagreements or arrangements, although no assurance can be given that theselicenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.If we are found to be infringing any intellectual property rights, we may berequired to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanentinjunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain hardware solutionsand services or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to payroyalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results couldbe materially adversely affected, regardless of whether we can developnon-infringing technology. While in managements opinion we do not have apotential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legalproceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or otherintellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, theresults of such potential claims cannot be predicted with certainty. In anypotential matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectualproperty rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved againstus in the same reporting period, our financial condition and operating resultscould be materially adversely affected. Availability of radiofrequencies may restrict the growth of the wireless communications industry anddemand for our products.      Radio frequencies are required toprovide wireless services. Industry growth has been and may continue to beaffected by the availability of licenses required to use frequencies and relatedcosts. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and othercountries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated to thevarious wireless services. The growth of the wireless communications industrymay be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, ifnew technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currentlyallocated for such use. 9We depend to some extent uponwireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, andemerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.     If we donot have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may beunable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow andachieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacityon the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security oftheir systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtimepurchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provideuninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able tosatisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity orneeded level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase andprofitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers wereto significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreementswith the wireless carriers generally have one to three-year terms. Some of thesewireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors, and if they competewith us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on their networks.Our business could be adverselyimpacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietaryInternet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with thewireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.      Our MRM business depends uponseveral Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our Company. Theseapplications, which are hosted by an independent Data Center and are connectedvia access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us toconfigure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determininglocation, speed or other conditions, and to deliver configuration code orexecutable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed orwere otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the properfunctioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, andcould result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary orpermanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with thesedevices. We may be subject to breaches ofour information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor,and customer relationships, and our customers access to our services.     Our business requires it to use andstore personally identifiable information of our employees and customers. Werequire user names and passwords in order to access our information technologysystems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure thetransmission and storage of data.      These security measures may becompromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error,malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and may resultin persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. If a computersecurity breach affects our systems, it could damage our reputation and alsoexpose us to litigation and possible liability, which could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.CalAmps products aresubject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries that are subject to change, which could make compliance costly andunpredictable.     CalAmps products are subject tocertain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States, Canada and othercountries in which it operates. In the United States, the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) regulates many aspects of communication devices, includingradiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices tobe connected to the telephone network. In Canada, similar regulations areadministered by Industry Canada. Although CalAmp has obtained necessary FCC andIndustry Canada approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be noassurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timelybasis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or theCompany may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals fromcountries other than Canada or the United States in which it currently sells itsproducts or in which it may sell its products in the future. We may be subject to productliability, warranty and recall claims, which may increase the costs of doingbusiness and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.      We are subject to a risk of productliability or warranty claims if our products or services actually or allegedlyfail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or are allegedto result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain what webelieve to be reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respondto such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, couldexceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to beavailable on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We cannot assure you thatwe will not incur significant costs to defend theseclaims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in thefuture. In addition, if any of our designed products are, or are alleged to be,defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of suchproducts. In the past five years, our warranty expense has fluctuated betweenapproximately 0.3% and 9.5% of sales on an annual basis. Individual quarterswere above or below the annual averages. The future cost associated withproviding product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement ofour products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.10Reduced consumer or corporatespending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and otheruncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and could continueto adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.      We dependon demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer, industrial,automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications of ourproducts. Our revenues are based on certain levels of consumer and corporatespending. If the significant reductions in consumer or corporate spending as aresult of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment continue, ourrevenues, profitability, ability to make debt payments and cash flow could beadversely affected. Our ability to make payments ofprincipal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future financialperformance and ability to generate positive operating cash flows, which issubject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, businessand other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which arebeyond our control.      If we are unable to generate sufficientcash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be requiredto, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;   obtain additional financing in the debt or equity markets;   sell selected assets or businesses;   reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or   reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.     Such measures might not besufficient to enable us to service our debt, and, if not, we could then be indefault under the applicable terms governing our debt, which could have amaterial adverse effect on us. In addition, any such financing, refinancing orsale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if atall. Rises in interest rates couldadversely affect our financial condition.      An increase in prevailing interestrates could have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on ourvariable rate bank debt with Square 1 Bank, which rise and fall upon changes ininterest rates on a periodic basis. Any increased interest expense associatedwith increases in interest rates affects our cash flow and could affect ourability to service our debt. Risks Relating to Our Common Stockand the Securities Market Anti-takeover defenses in ourcharter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit theprice that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in anacquisition.     Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any businesscombination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from thetime the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions aremet. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make itdifficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without the approval ofour Board of Directors, including authorized but undesignated preferred stockand provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actionsto be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay orprevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might bewilling to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. 11The trading price of shares ofour common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of ourcommon stock could decline.     As apublicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuatedsignificantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may bevolatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to suchfactors, including:actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or  operating results;  failure to meet  securities analysts or investors expectations of performance;   changes in key  management personnel;  announcements of  technological innovations or new products by CalAmp or its competitors;   developments in or  disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  proposed and  completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  the mix of products  and services sold;  the timing,  placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  product and service  pricing and discounts;  acts of war or  terrorism; and  general economic  conditions.Our stock price has been highlyvolatile in the past and could be highly volatile in thefuture.     The market price of our stock hasbeen highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this AnnualReport, as well as other factors, including: substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and  earnings due to our current dependence on a small number of major  customers;  comments by securities analysts;  and our failure to meet market expectations.       Over thetwo-year period ended February 28, 2012, the price of CalAmp common stock asreported on The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a high of $5.14 to a low of$1.96. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price andvolume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance ofparticular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatilityhave sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class actionlitigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result insubstantial costs and a diversion of managements attention andresources.Lack of expected dividends maymake our stock less attractive as an investment.     We intend to retain all futureearnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate payingany cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Generally,stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and soour stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy"
13,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2011-04-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       The following list describes several risk factors which are unique to our Company:  The Company is dependent on a significant customer, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future sales and its ability to grow.       EchoStar accounted for about one-third of the Company’s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2011. The loss of EchoStar as a customer, deterioration in its overall business, or a decrease in its volume of sales, could result in decreased sales for us and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow our business. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from this key customer could result in write-offs or in the loss of future business and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.       We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customers can cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products from our competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and they are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share.       The market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expect competition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products in the market. Any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully.       Information about the Company’s competitors is included Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"".  6  Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile.      Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include:the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, orders for our products;   our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions;   announcements, new product introductions and reductions in the price of products offered by our competitors;  our ability to achieve cost reductions;  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products;  our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;   our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold;   the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers;  increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors;  fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and  telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally.      Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.  Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.       Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. Also, our DBS outdoor receiver housings, subassemblies and some of our electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for which alternative sources are not readily available. In the event of a reduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months to begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As a result, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.       In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements and which caused us to incur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on the addition of new product features. In the past, we have experienced delays in introducing some new product features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets, we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operate at different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Our inability to develop new products or product features on a timely basis, or the failure of new products or product features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business. 7  If demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage the business efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.       Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and cause losses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete if products evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products. Our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability. Any of these results could adversely affect our business.  Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countries other than the United States, we are subject to different regulatory policies. We may not be able to develop products that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result in our inability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political, economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products and which could adversely affect our business.       If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our international business. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards. If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell our products in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change. If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.       Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 9%, 7%, and 11% of CalAmp’s total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Assuming that we continue to sell our products to foreign customers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business.       Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if the Chinese government allows the value of its currency to rise vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, our product housings and subassemblies that are sourced in China could become more expensive, putting pressure on our profit margins.  We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.       Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does not depend upon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection. We currently hold 30 patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with all employees, including officers, managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.  8  We may be subject to infringement claims that may disrupt the conduct of our business and affect our profitability.       We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others, even though we take steps to assure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporate unlicensed copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property into our products. It is possible that third parties may claim that our products and services infringe upon their trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delays in introducing new or improved products or services, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challenged intellectual property. Successful infringement claims against us may materially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.  Availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wireless communications industry and demand for our products.       Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated to the various wireless services. The growth of the wireless communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use.       Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the availability of licenses required to use frequencies and related costs. Over the last several years, network deployments for public safety mobile broadband data communications has been slowed due to the unavailability of the portion of the 700MHz spectrum intended for public safety use. Demand for our products may continue to be adversely affected so long as the rules for utilizing such spectrum, which are determined by governmental agencies, remain unclear. We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven business models, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.       If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers’ needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase and profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors, and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on their networks.  Our business could be adversely impacted by the interruption, failure or corruption of our proprietary Internet-based systems that are used to configure and communicate with the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell.       Our Mobile Resource Management business depends upon several Internet-based systems that are proprietary to our Company. These applications, which are hosted by a Tier 1 Data Center and are connected via access points to cellular networks, are used by our customers and by us to configure and communicate with wireless devices for purposes of determining location, speed or other conditions, and to deliver configuration code or executable commands to the devices. If these Internet-based systems failed or were otherwise compromised in some way, it could adversely affect the proper functioning of the wireless tracking and monitoring devices that we sell, and could result in damages being incurred by us as a result of the temporary or permanent inability of our customers to wirelessly communicate with these devices.  9  New laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase costs or reduce opportunities for us to earn revenue.       Except as described below under “Governmental Regulation,"" we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) or any other governmental agency, other than regulations applicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered in California. However, in the future, we may become subject to regulation by the FCC or another regulatory agency. In addition, the wireless carriers that supply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the FCC, and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services. CalAmp’s products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries that are subject to change, making compliance costly and unpredictable.      CalAmp’s products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States, Canada and other countries in which it operates. In the United States, the FCC regulates many aspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telephone network. In Canada, similar regulations are administered by Industry Canada. Although CalAmp has obtained necessary FCC and Industry Canada approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatory requirements may change or the Company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than Canada or the United States in which it currently sells its products or in which it may sell its products in the future.       The FCC and Industry Canada may be slow in adopting new regulations allowing private wireless networks to deliver higher data rates in licensed frequency bands for public safety applications. This could adversely affect demand for private networks as traditional private network users may opt for public network connections for all or part of their wireless communication needs. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition since the Company’s Wireless Networks data products are currently used in private networks.  Reduced consumer or corporate spending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and other uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.       We depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer, industrial, automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications of our products. Our revenues are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. If the significant reductions in consumer or corporate spending as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment continue, our revenues, profitability, ability to make debt payments and cash flow could be adversely affected.  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future financial performance and ability to generate positive operating cash flows, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.       If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;  obtain additional financing in the debt or equity markets;  sell selected assets or businesses;  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or  reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.      Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, and, if not, we could then be in default under the applicable terms governing our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all.  10  Rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition.      An increase in prevailing interest rates could have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate bank debt with Square 1 Bank, which rise and fall, subject to a minimum monthly interest payment, upon changes in interest rates on a periodic basis. Any increased interest expense associated with increases in interest rates affects our cash flow and could affect our ability to service our debt.  Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market  Anti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquired or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.      Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy the Company without the approval of our Board of Directors, including a stockholder rights plan, authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoing could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of our common stock could decline.      As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results;  failure to meet securities analysts’ or investors’ expectations of performance;  changes in key management personnel;  announcements of technological innovations or new products by CalAmp or its competitors;  developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  the mix of products and services sold;  the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  product and service pricing and discounts;  acts of war or terrorism; and  general economic conditions. Our stock price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future.      The market price of our stock has been highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as other factors, including: substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to our current dependence on a small number of major customers;   comments by securities analysts; and  our failure to meet market expectations. 11       Over the two-year period ended February 28, 2011, the price of CalAmp common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a high of $3.77 to a low of $0.37. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources. Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.      We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Generally, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy. "
11,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2010-05-06,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following list describes several risk factors which are unique to our Company:The Company is dependent on its major customer, the loss of which could have a material adverseeffect on the Companys future sales and its ability to grow.The Companys top customer, EchoStar, accounted for almost half of the Companys consolidatedrevenues for fiscal 2010. The loss of EchoStar as a customer, deterioration in its overallbusiness, or a decrease in its volume of sales, could result in decreased sales for us and couldhave a material adverse impact on our ability to grow our business. A substantial decrease orinterruption in business from this key customer could result in write-offs or in the loss of futurebusiness and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations.We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasingproducts at any time, which could significantly harm our revenues.We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreementswith our customers do not currently provide us with any assurance of future sales. These customerscan cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchaseproducts from our competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order andthey are not required to make minimum purchases. Any of these actions taken by our customers couldhave a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results ofoperations. 6 Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors havegreater resources than us, we cannot be certain that our products will continue to be accepted inthe marketplace or capture increased market share.The market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technologicalchange, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expect competition tointensify as our competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market.Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that anycompetitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establish andsustain our products in the market. Any increase in price or other competition could result inerosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and could have a negativeimpact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that wewill have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities tocompete successfully.Information about the Companys competitors is included Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K under the heading COMPETITION.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating resultsto fluctuate and our stock price to continue to be volatile.Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuatesignificantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.Some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include:  the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, orders for our products;  our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products and productenhancements and manage product transitions;  announcements, new product introductions and reductions in the price of products offeredby our competitors;  our ability to achieve cost reductions;  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for ourproducts;  our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for ourproducts;  our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channelsthrough which they are sold;  the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders fromthose customers;  increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized competitors;  fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and  telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditionsgenerally.Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates, purchase orders andproduct availability, significant volume shipments of products could occur close to the end of afiscal quarter. Failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operatingresults. In the future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders withoutnotice. Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue, expenses and results of operationscould vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied uponas indications of future performance.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchasedfrom sole source suppliers or require long lead times, our business is subject to unexpectedinterruptions, which could cause our operating results to suffer.Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times. Also, our DBSoutdoor receiver housings, subassemblies and some of our electronic components are purchased fromsole source vendors for which alternative sources are not readily available. In the event of areduction or interruption of supply, or degradation in quality, it could take up to six months tobegin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers, if any. As aresult, product shipments could be delayed and revenues and results of operations couldsuffer. Furthermore, if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary tomanufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand, customers could choose topurchase competing products and we could lose market share. Any of these events could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. 7 If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could be adversely affected.In the past, we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements and which caused us toincur unexpected expenses. In addition, some of our existing customers have conditioned theirfuture purchases of our products on the addition of product features. In the past we haveexperienced delays in introducing new features. Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets,we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operate at differentfrequencies and comply with diverse, new or varying governmental regulations in each market. Ourinability to develop new products or product features on a timely basis, or the failure of newproducts or product features to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.If demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may be difficult to manage thebusiness efficiently, which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability.Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for future demand. Many costs,particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.Rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products may make it difficult to plan productioncapacity and business operations efficiently. If demand is significantly below expectations, wemay be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which can diminish gross margins and causelosses. A sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory, which may be rendered obsoleteas products evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products. Our ability to reducecosts and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research anddevelopment to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for ourexisting customer base. Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant coststo rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components and outsource additionalmanufacturing processes. These costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability.Any of these results could adversely affect our business.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of our products in countriesother than the United States, we are subject to different regulatory schemes. We may not be ableto develop products that comply with the standards of different countries, which could result inour inability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political, economic, andother conditions affecting such countries, which could result in reduced sales of our products andwhich could adversely affect our business.If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow our internationalbusiness. Many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply withunique regulations, including safety regulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards.If we cannot develop products that work with different standards, we will be unable to sell ourproducts in those locations. If compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than weanticipate, our business would be adversely affected. Some countries have not completed theirradio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we wouldbe required to comply. Furthermore, standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change.If we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards, our business and results of operationswill be adversely affected.Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 7%, 12% and 6% of CalAmps total sales forthe fiscal years ended February 28, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Assuming that we continueto sell our products to foreign customers, we will be subject to the political, economic and otherconditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including in Africa, theMiddle East, Europe and Asia. Any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries inwhich we operate and our present trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift inU.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in the political, economic orfinancial condition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of our products todecrease, or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions,any of which could adversely affect our business.Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassemblies are currently procuredfrom foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and other PacificRim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significantdownturn in the political, economic or financial condition of these countries could causedisruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, which couldadversely affect our business. In addition, if the Chinese government allows the value of itscurrency to rise vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, our product housings and subassemblies that are sourcedin China could become more expensive, putting pressure on our profit margins. 8 We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our competitors may be ableto offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position.Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does not depend upon patentedtechnology, our ability to succeed in wireless data communications markets may depend, in largepart, upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless technologies. We currently relyprimarily on patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractualprovisions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, these mechanisms provide uswith only limited protection. We currently hold 30 patents. As part of our confidentialityprocedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with all employees, including officers,managers and engineers. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtainand use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently.Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in someforeign countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with anylegal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicate ourproducts and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.We may be subject to infringement claims that may disrupt the conduct of our business and affectour profitability.We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to theintellectual property of others, even though we take steps to assure that neither our employees norour contractors knowingly incorporate unlicensed copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectualproperty into our products. It is possible that third parties may claim that our products andservices infringe upon their trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights. Any suchclaims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delays in introducingnew or improved products or services, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements orrequire us to stop using the challenged intellectual property. Successful infringement claimsagainst us may materially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.Availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wireless communications industryand demand for our products.Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies isregulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum spaceis allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless communications industry may beaffected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are notdeveloped to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use.Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the availability of licensesrequired to use frequencies and related costs. Over the last several years, frequency spectrum hasbeen reallocated for specific applications and the related frequency relocation costs haveincreased significantly. This significant reassignment of spectrum has slowed, and may continue toslow, the growth of the wireless communications industry. Growth is slowed because some customershave funding constraints limiting their ability to purchase new technology to upgrade systems andthe financial results for a number of businesses have been affected by the industrys rate ofgrowth. Slowed industry growth may restrict the demand for our products.A failure to rapidly transition or to transition at all to newer digital technologies couldadversely affect our business.Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our wireless businesses to continueits transition to newer digital technologies, and to successfully compete in these markets and gainmarket share. We face intense competition in these markets from both established companies and newentrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive to develop and bring tomarket. If we are unable to successfully make this transition, our business and results ofoperations could be adversely impacted. 9 We depend to some extent upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unproven businessmodels, and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow.If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, we may beunable to deliver services and our sales could decrease. Our ability to grow and achieveprofitability partly depends on our ability to buysufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and securityof their systems. Some of our wireless services are delivered using airtime purchased from thirdparties. We depend on these third parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors ordefects and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide therequired capacity or needed level of service. In addition, our expenses would increase andprofitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to significantlyincrease the prices of their services. Our existing agreements with the wireless carriersgenerally have one-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, ourcompetitors, and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with airtime on theirnetworks.New laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase costs or reduce opportunities forus to earn revenue.Except as described below under Governmental Regulation, we are not currently subject todirect regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any other governmentalagency, other than regulations applicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that areheadquartered in California. However, in the future, we may become subject to regulation by the FCCor another regulatory agency. In addition, the wireless carriers that supply airtime and certainhardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the FCC, and regulations that affect them couldincrease our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services.CalAmps products are subject to mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States and othercountries that are subject to change, making compliance costly and unpredictable.CalAmps products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the United States,Canada and other countries in which it operates. In the United States, the FCC regulates manyaspects of communication devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safetyand rules for devices to be connected to the telephone network. In Canada, similar regulations areadministered by Industry Canada. Although CalAmp has obtained necessary FCC and Industry Canadaapprovals for all products it currently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can beobtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, such regulatoryrequirements may change or the Company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessaryapprovals from countries other than Canada or the United States in which it currently sells itsproducts or in which it may sell its products in the future.The FCC and Industry Canada may be slow in adopting new regulations allowing private wirelessnetworks to deliver higher data rates in licensed frequency bands for public safety applications.This could adversely affect demand for private networks as traditional private network users mayopt for public network connections for all or part of their wireless communication needs. Thiscould have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financialcondition since the Companys Wireless Networks data products are currently used in privatenetworks.Reduced consumer or corporate spending due to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 andother uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment have affected and could continue to adverselyaffect our revenues and cash flow.We depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer, industrial, automotiveand other markets we serve for the end market applications of our products. Our revenues are basedon certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. If the significant reductions in consumer orcorporate spending as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment continue,our revenues, profitability, ability to make debt payments and cash flow could be adverselyaffected.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our futurefinancial performance and ability to generate positive operating cash flows, which is subject togeneral economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affectingour consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service ourdebt, we may be required to, among other things:  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;  obtain additional financing in the debt or equity markets; 10   sell selected assets or businesses;  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or  reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, and, if not, we couldthen be in default under the applicable terms governing our debt, which could have a materialadverse effect on us. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not beavailable on economically favorable terms, if at all.Rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition.An increase in prevailing interest rates could have an immediate effect on the interest ratescharged on our variable rate bank debt with Square 1 Bank, which rise and fall, subject to aminimum monthly interest payment, upon changes in interest rates on a periodic basis. Anyincreased interest expense associated with increases in interest rates affects our cash flow andcould affect our ability to service our debt.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities MarketAnti-takeover defenses in our charter and under Delaware law could prevent us from being acquiredor limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in an acquisition.Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation fromengaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three yearsfrom the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. Inaddition, we have in place various protections which would make it difficult for a company orinvestor to buy the Company without the approval of our Board of Directors, including a stockholderrights plan, authorized but undesignated preferred stock and provisions requiring advance notice ofboard nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings. All of the foregoingcould hinder, delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors mightbe willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.The trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors and the price ofshares of our common stock could decline.As a publicly traded company, the trading price of our common stock has fluctuatedsignificantly in the past. The future trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatileand could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results;  failure to meet securities analysts or investors expectations of performance;  changes in key management personnel;  announcements of technological innovations or new products by CalAmp or its competitors;  developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights;  proposed and completed acquisitions by us or our competitors;  the mix of products and services sold;  the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders;  product and service pricing and discounts;  acts of war or terrorism; and  general economic conditions. 11 Our stock price is highly volatile and we expect it to remain highly volatile.The market price of our stock has been highly volatile and we expect it to remain highlyvolatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, as well as otherfactors, including:  substantial volatility in quarterly revenues and earnings due to our current dependenceon a small number of major customers;  comments by securities analysts; and  our failure to meet market expectations.Over the two-year period ended February 28, 2010, the price of CalAmp common stock as reportedon The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a high of $3.77 to a low of $0.37. The stock market hasfrom time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to theoperating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experiencedvolatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation.If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversionof managements attention and resources.Lack of expected dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do notanticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Generally,stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price maybe lower as a result of our dividend policy"
12,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2009-05-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The following list describes several risk factors which are unique toour Company:The Company is dependent on its major customers, the loss of any of whichcould have a material adverse effect on the Company's future sales and itsability to grow.     The Company's top two customers, Echostar and DirecTV, accounted for15.7% and 10.3%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues forfiscal 2009.  Echostar and DirecTV in the aggregate accounted for 34.8% ofCalAmp's consolidated revenues for fiscal 2008 and 69.5% of its consolidatedrevenues for fiscal 2007.  EFJ accounted for 4.8%, 14.2% and 5.3% of CalAmp'sconsolidated revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The lossof Echostar, DirecTV or EFJ as a customer, a deterioration in the overallbusiness of any of them, or a decrease in the volume of sales by any of them,could result in decreased sales and could have a material adverse impact onCalAmp's ability to grow its business.  A substantial decrease orinterruption in business from any of these key customers could result inwrite-offs or in the loss of future business and could have a materialadverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results ofoperations.We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customersmay cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm ourrevenues.     We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.  As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us withany assurance of future sales.  These customers can cease purchasing productsfrom us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products fromour competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on eachorder and they are not required to make minimum purchases.Changes in the forecasted product demand from a DBS customer may require anincrease in our inventory reserves and/or reserve for vendor commitmentliabilities.     At February 28, 2009, the Company had on-hand inventory of approximately$3.1 million and outstanding purchase commitments of $3.4 million formaterials that are specific to the products that the Company manufactures fora key DBS customer, which amounts are not currently reserved for because theCompany believes these materials can be used in the ordinary course ofbusiness as future shipments of products are made to this customer.Nonetheless, changes in the forecasted product demand from this customercould require that the inventory reserve and/or the reserve for vendorcommitment liabilities be increased to cover some portion of these amounts.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many ofour competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that ourproducts will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increasedmarket share.     The market for DBS products and other wireless products is intenselycompetitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingstandards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expectcompetition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offeringsand new competitors enter the market.  Given the highly competitiveenvironment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitiveadvantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establishand sustain our products in the market.  Any increase in price or othercompetition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent wehave obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on our financialcondition and results of operations.  We cannot provide assurance that wewill have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing andsupport capabilities to compete successfully.     Information about the Company's competitors is included in Part I, Item1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"".Our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly orannual operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to continue to bevolatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors,many of which are outside of our control.  Some of the factors that couldaffect our quarterly or annual operating results include:      >  the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, orders         for our products;      >  our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products and         product enhancements and manage product transitions;      >  announcements, new product introductions and reductions in the price         Of products offered by our competitors;      >  our ability to achieve cost reductions;      >  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source         components for our products;      >  our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality         levels for our products;      >  our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of         distribution channels through which they are sold;      >  the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant         reduction in orders from those customers;      >  increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized         competitors;      >  fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and      >  telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and         economic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur at the end of a fiscal quarter.  Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results.  Inthe future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice.  Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue,expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future,and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications offuture performance.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturingservices are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times,our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause ouroperating results to suffer.     Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes.  Also, our DBS dish antennas, LNBF housings, subassemblies and some ofour electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for whichalternative sources are not readily available.  In the event of a reductionor interruption of supply, or a degradation in quality, as many as six monthscould be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies fromalternative suppliers, if any.  As a result, product shipments could bedelayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer.  Furthermore, ifwe receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary tomanufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand,customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share.If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could beadversely affected.     Our inability to develop new products or product features on a timelybasis, or the failure of new products or product features to achieve marketacceptance, could adversely affect our business.  In the past, we haveexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses.  In addition, some of ourexisting customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products onthe addition of product features. In the past we have experienced delays inintroducing new features.  Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets,we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operateat different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varying governmentalregulations in each market.If demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may bedifficult to manage the business efficiently, which may result in reducedgross margins and profitability.     Our cost structure is based in part on our expectations for futuredemand.  Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.  Rapid and unpredictable shiftsin demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacityand business operations efficiently.  If demand is significantly belowexpectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which candiminish gross margins and cause losses.  A sudden downturn may also leave uswith excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete as products evolveduring the downturn and demand shifts to newer products.  Our ability toreduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continueto invest in research and development to maintain our competitive positionand to maintain service and support for our existing customer base.Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant coststo rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components andoutsource additional manufacturing processes.  These costs could reduce ourgross margins and overall profitability.  Any of these results couldadversely affect our business.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of ourproducts in countries other than the United States, we are subject todifferent regulatory schemes.  We may not be able to develop products thatwork with the standards of different countries, which could result in ourinability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political,economic, and other conditions affecting such countries, which could resultin reduced sales of our products and which could adversely affect ourbusiness.     If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow ourinternational business.  Many countries require communications equipment usedin their country to comply with unique regulations, including safetyregulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards.  If we cannotdevelop products that work with different standards, we will be unable tosell our products in those locations.  If compliance proves to be moreexpensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would beadversely affected.  Some countries have not completed their radio frequencyallocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which wewould be forced to comply.  Furthermore, standards and regulatoryrequirements are subject to change.  If we fail to anticipate or comply withthese new standards, our business and results of operations will be adverselyaffected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 12%, 6% and 6% ofCalAmp's total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2009, 2008 and2007, respectively.  Assuming that we continue to sell our products toforeign customers, we will be subject to the political, economic and otherconditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S.,including Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.  Any interruption orcurtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and ourpresent trading partners, changes in exchange rates, significant shift inU.S. trade policy toward these countries, or significant downturn in thepolitical, economic or financial condition of these countries, could causedemand for and sales of our products to decrease, or subject us to increasedregulation including future import and export restrictions, any of whichcould adversely affect our business.     Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassembliesare currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong,mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries.  Any significantshift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturnin the political, economic or financial condition of these countries couldcause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, whichcould adversely affect our business.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and ourcompetitors may be able to offer similar products and services that wouldharm our competitive position.     Other than in our Satellite products business, which currently does notdepend upon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless datacommunications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectualproperty for some of our wireless technologies.  We currently rely primarilyon patents, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures andcontractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property.However, these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection.  Wecurrently hold 21 patents.  As part of our confidentiality procedures, weenter into non-disclosure agreements with all employees, including officers,managers and engineers.  Despite these precautions, third parties could copyor otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or developsimilar technology independently.  Furthermore, effective protection ofintellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreigncountries.  The protection of our intellectual property rights may notprovide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently developsimilar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around anyintellectual property rights we hold.We may be subject to infringement claims that may disrupt the conduct of ourbusiness and affect our profitability.     We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to timerelating to the intellectual property of others, even though we take steps toassure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporateunlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products.  It is possiblethat third parties may claim that our products and services infringe upontheir trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights.  Any such claims,regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delaysin introducing new or improved products or services, require us to enter intoroyalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challengedintellectual property.  Successful infringement claims against us maymaterially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.Availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wirelesscommunications industry and demand for our products.     Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services.  Theallocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and othercountries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated towireless services.  The growth of the wireless communications industry may beaffected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if newtechnologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currentlyallocated for such use.     Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by theavailability of licenses required to use frequencies and related costs.  Overthe last several years, frequency spectrum has been reallocated for specificapplications and the related frequency relocation costs have increasedsignificantly.  This significant reassignment of spectrum has slowed and maycontinue to slow the growth of the industry.  Growth is slowed because somecustomers have funding constraints limiting their ability to purchase newtechnology to upgrade systems and the financial results for a number ofbusinesses have been affected by the industry's rate of growth.  Slowedindustry growth may restrict the demand for our products.A failure to rapidly transition or to transition at all to newer digitaltechnologies could adversely affect our business.     Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our wirelessbusinesses to continue their transition to newer digital technologies, and tosuccessfully compete in these markets and gain market share. We face intensecompetition in these markets from both established companies and newentrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive todevelop and bring to market.We depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others, unprovenbusiness models and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existingservices and to grow.     If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease.Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our abilityto buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on thereliability and security of their systems.  Some of our wireless services aredelivered using airtime purchased from third parties.  We depend on thesethird parties to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defectsand would not be able to satisfy our customers' needs if they failed toprovide the required capacity or needed level of service.  In addition, ourexpenses would increase and profitability could be materially adverselyaffected if wireless carriers were to significantly increase the prices oftheir services.  Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generallyhave one-year terms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become,our competitors, and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide uswith airtime on their networks.New laws and regulations that impact the industry could increase costs orreduce opportunities for us to earn revenue.     Except as described below under ""Governmental Regulation"", we are notcurrently subject to direct regulation by the Federal CommunicationsCommission (""FCC"") or any other governmental agency, other than regulationsapplicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered inCalifornia. However, in the future, we may become subject to regulation bythe FCC or another regulatory agency. In addition, the wireless carriers thatsupply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject to regulation bythe FCC, and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduceour ability to continue selling and supporting our services.Governmental Regulation     CalAmp's products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvalsin the United States, Canada and other countries in which it operates.  Inthe United States, the FCC regulates many aspects of communication devices,including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rulesfor devices to be connected to the telephone network.  In Canada, similarregulations are administered by Industry Canada.  Although CalAmp hasobtained necessary FCC and Industry Canada approvals for all products itcurrently sells, there can be no assurance that such approvals can beobtained for future products on a timely basis, or at all.  In addition, suchregulatory requirements may change or the Company may not in the future beable to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than Canada orthe United States in which it currently sells its products or in which it maysell its products in the future.     The FCC and Industry Canada may be slow in adopting new regulationsallowing private wireless networks to deliver higher data rates in licensedfrequency bands for public safety applications.  This could adversely affectdemand for private networks as traditional private network users may opt forpublic network connections for all or part of their wireless communicationneeds.  This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,results of operations and financial condition since the Company's PublicSafety Mobile data products are currently used predominantly in privatenetworks.Our bank credit agreement has a maturity date of December 31, 2009.      At February 28, 2009, outstanding borrowings on the bank term loanamounted to $17.6 million.  The Company believes that it will be able torefinance the bank term loan from the proceeds of an asset based loan beforethe December 31, 2009 maturity date, possibly supplemented by proceeds ofanother funding source.  However, there is no assurance that the Company willbe able to refinance the term loan from other funding sources, particularlygiven the current credit market difficulties, or will be able to extend thematurity date of the bank loan in the event efforts to refinance the loan arenot successful.Reduced consumer or corporate spending due to uncertainties in themacroeconomic environment could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow,and our ability to make payments on our debt and operate our businesses.      We depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer,industrial, automotive and other markets we serve for the end marketapplications of our products.  Our revenues are based on certain levels ofconsumer and corporate spending.  If the significant reductions in consumeror corporate spending as a result of uncertain conditions in themacroeconomic environment continue, our revenues, profitability and cash flowcould be adversely affected.      Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on ourindebtedness depends upon our future financial performance and ability togenerate positive operating cash flows, which is subject to general economicconditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factorsaffecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in thefuture to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things:>   refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;>   obtain additional financing in the debt or equity markets;>   sell selected assets or businesses;>   reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or>   reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.      Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt,and, if not, we could then be in default under the applicable terms governingour debt, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  In addition, anysuch financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available oneconomically favorable terms, if at all.Rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition.      An increase in prevailing interest rates has an immediate effect on theinterest rates charged on our variable rate bank debt, which rise and fallupon changes in interest rates on a periodic basis.   Any increased interestexpense associated with increases in interest rates affects our cash flow andcould affect our ability to service our debt.It is possible that our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq and ifthis were to occur, the market price and liquidity of our common stock couldbe negatively affected.       Nasdaq has established certain standards for the continued listing ofa security on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.  The standards for continuedlisting include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for thelisted securities be at least $1.00 per share.  Under these rules, a securityis considered deficient if it fails to achieve at least a $1.00 closing bidprice for a period of 30 consecutive business days.  Our common stock hastraded below $1.00 for substantially all of the period since October 2008.Although Nasdaq has suspended this rule until at least July 20, 2009, thereis no assurance that the minimum bid price of the Company's stock will be incompliance when this rule is reinstated and that Nasdaq will not initiateprocedures to delist our common stock if we fail to comply with this rule.If our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, the price of our commonstock and the ability of holders to sell such stock could be adverselyaffected, and we would be required to comply with the initial listingrequirements to be relisted on Nasdaq"
17,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2008-05-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The following list describes several risk factors which are unique toour Company:The Company is dependent on its significant customers, the loss of any ofwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future sales andits ability to sustain its growth.     The Company's top three customers, DirecTV, EFJ and Echostar, accountedfor 23.9%, 14.2% and 10.9%, respectively, of the Company's consolidatedrevenues for fiscal 2008.  DirecTV, EFJ and Echostar in the aggregateaccounted for 74.8% of CalAmp's consolidated revenues for fiscal 2007 and81.6% of its consolidated revenues for fiscal 2006.  The loss of DirecTV, EFJor Echostar as a customer, a deterioration in the overall business of any ofthem, or a decrease in the volume of sales by any of them, could result indecreased sales and could have a material adverse impact on CalAmp's abilityto grow its business.  A substantial decrease or interruption in businessfrom any of the Company's significant customers could result in write-offs orin the loss of future business and could have a material adverse effect onthe Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customersmay cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm ourrevenues.     We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.  As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us withany assurance of future sales.  These customers can cease purchasing productsfrom us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products fromour competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on eachorder and they are not required to make minimum purchases.Changes in the forecasted product demand from a DBS customer may require anincrease in our inventory reserves and/or reserve for vendor commitmentliabilities.     The Company has on-hand inventory of approximately $10.1 million andoutstanding purchase commitments of $8.6 million for materials that arespecific to the products that the Company manufactures for a key DBScustomer, which amounts are not currently reserved for because the Companybelieves these materials can be used in the ordinary course of business asfuture shipments of products are made to this customer.  Nonetheless, changesin the forecasted product demand from this customer could require that theinventory reserve and/or the reserve for vendor commitment liabilities beincreased to cover some portion of these amounts.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many ofour competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that ourproducts will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increasedmarket share.     The market for DBS products and other wireless products is intenselycompetitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingstandards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expectcompetition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offeringsand new competitors enter the market.  Given the highly competitiveenvironment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitiveadvantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establishand sustain our products in the market.  Any increase in price or othercompetition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent wehave obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on our financialcondition and results of operations.  We cannot provide assurance that wewill have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing andsupport capabilities to compete successfully.     Information about the Company's competitors is included in Part I, Item1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"".Multiple factors beyond the Company's control may cause fluctuations in ouroperating results and may cause our business to suffer.     The revenues and results of our operations may fluctuate significantly,depending on a variety of factors, including the following:  >   our dependence on two major customers in our satellite products      business that currently account for a substantial portion of our      overall sales;  >   the introduction of new products and services by competitors; and  >   seasonality in the equipment market for the U.S. DBS subscription      television industry.     We will not be able to control many of these factors.  In addition, ifour revenues in a particular period do not meet expectations, we may not beable to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause ourbusiness to suffer.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause the Company'squarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and its stock price to bevolatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors,many of which are outside of our control.  Some of the factors that couldaffect our quarterly or annual operating results include:  >   the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, orders      for our products;  >   our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products and      product enhancements and manage product transitions;  >   announcements, new product introductions and reductions in price of      products offered by our competitors;  >   our ability to achieve cost reductions;  >   our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source      components for our products;  >   our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality      levels for our products;  >   our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of      distribution channels through which they are sold;  >   the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction      in orders from those customers;  >   increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized      competitors;  >   fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and  >   telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and      economic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur at the end of a fiscal quarter.  Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results.  Inthe future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice.  Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue,expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future,and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications offuture performance.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturingservices are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times,our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause ouroperating results to suffer.     Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes.  Also, our DBS dish antennas, LNBF housings, subassemblies and some ofour electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for whichalternative sources are not readily available.  In the event of a reductionor interruption of supply, or a degradation in quality, as many as six monthscould be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies fromalternative suppliers, if any.  As a result, product shipments could bedelayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer.  Furthermore, ifwe receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary tomanufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand,customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share.If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could beadversely affected.     Our inability to develop new products or product features on a timelybasis, or the failure of new products or product features to achieve marketacceptance, could adversely affect our business.  In the past, we haveexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused us to incur unexpected expenses.  In addition, some of ourexisting customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products onthe addition of product features. In the past we have experienced delays inintroducing new features.  Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets,we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operateat different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varying governmentalregulations in each market.If demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may bedifficult to manage the business efficiently which may result in reducedgross margins and profitability.     Our cost structure will be based in part on our expectations for futuredemand.  Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.  Rapid and unpredictable shiftsin demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacityand business operations efficiently.  If demand is significantly belowexpectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which candiminish gross margins and cause losses.  A sudden downturn may also leave uswith excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete as products evolveduring the downturn and demand shifts to newer products.  Our ability toreduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continueto invest in research and development to maintain our competitive positionand to maintain service and support for our existing customer base.Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant coststo rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components andoutsource additional manufacturing processes.  These costs could reduce ourgross margins and overall profitability.  Any of these results couldadversely affect our business.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow the sales of, certain of ourproducts in countries other than the United States, we are subject todifferent regulatory schemes.  We may not be able to develop products thatwork with the standards of different countries, which could result in ourinability to sell our products and, further, we may be subject to political,economic, and other conditions affecting such countries that could result inreduced sales of our products and which could adversely affect our business.     If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow ourinternational business.  Many countries require communications equipment usedin their country to comply with unique regulations, including safetyregulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards.  If we cannotdevelop products that work with different standards, we will be unable tosell our products in those locations.  If compliance proves to be moreexpensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would beadversely affected.  Some countries have not completed their radio frequencyallocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which wewould be forced to comply.  Furthermore, standards and regulatoryrequirements are subject to change.  If we fail to anticipate or comply withthese new standards, our business and results of operations will be adverselyaffected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 6%, 6% and 5% ofCalAmp's total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2008, 2007 and2006, respectively.  Assuming that we continue to sell our products to suchcustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including Africa,the Middle East, Europe and Asia.  Any interruption or curtailment of tradebetween the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners,change in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward thesecountries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financialcondition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of ourproducts to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including futureimport and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness.     Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassembliesare currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong,mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries.  Any significantshift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturnin the political, economic or financial condition of these countries couldcause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, whichcould adversely affect our business.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and ourcompetitors may be able to offer similar products and services that wouldharm our competitive position.     Other than in our DBS products business, which currently does not dependupon patented technology, our ability to succeed in wireless datacommunications markets may depend, in large part, upon our intellectualproperty for some of our wireless.  We currently rely primarily on patents,trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractualprovisions to establish and protect our intellectual property.  Thesemechanisms provide us with only limited protection.  We currently hold 23patents and have 2 patent applications pending.  As part of ourconfidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with allof our executive officers, managers and supervisory employees.  Despite theseprecautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use ourtechnology without authorization, or develop similar technologyindependently.  Furthermore, effective protection of intellectual propertyrights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries.  The protectionof our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedyshould our competitors independently develop similar technology, duplicateour products and services, or design around any intellectual property rightswe hold.We may be subject to infringement claims which may disrupt the conduct of ourbusiness and affect our profitability.     We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to timerelating to the intellectual property of others, even though we take steps toassure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporateunlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products.  It is possiblethat third parties may claim that our products and services may infringe upontheir trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights.  Any such claims,regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delaysin introducing new or improved products or services, require us to enter intoroyalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challengedintellectual property.  Successful infringement claims against us maymaterially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.We may engage in future acquisitions that have adverse consequences for ourbusiness.     In May 2006 we acquired Dataradio and the TechnoCom MRM product line, inMarch 2007 we acquired Aircept and in April 2007 we acquired Smartlink RadioNetworks.  We may make additional acquisitions of businesses, products ortechnologies in the future in order to complement our existing productofferings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technologicalcapabilities.  However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to locatesuitable acquisition opportunities.  The acquisitions that we have completedand that we may complete in the future could result in the following, any ofwhich could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of ourstock: (1) issuances of our equity securities that would dilute thepercentage ownership of our current stockholders; (2) large one-time write-offs; (3) the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; (4) difficultiesin the assimilation and integration of the acquired companies; (5) diversionof management's attention from other business concerns; (6) contractualdisputes; (7) risks of entering geographic and business markets in which wehave no or only limited prior experience; and (8) potential loss of keyemployees or customers of acquired organizations.Availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wirelesscommunications industry and demand for our products.     Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services.  Theallocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and othercountries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated towireless services.  The growth of the wireless communications industry may beaffected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if newtechnologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currentlyallocated for such use.     Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by theavailability of licenses required to use frequencies and related costs.  Overthe last several years, frequency spectrum has been reallocated for specificapplications and the related frequency relocation costs have increasedsignificantly.  This significant reassignment of spectrum has slowed and maycontinue to slow the growth of the industry.  Growth is slowed because somecustomers have funding constraints limiting their ability to purchase newtechnology to upgrade systems and the financial results for a number ofbusinesses have been affected by the industry's rate of growth.  Slowedindustry growth may restrict the demand for our products.A failure to rapidly transition or to transition at all to newer digitaltechnologies could adversely affect our business.     Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our wirelessbusinesses to continue their transition to newer digital technologies, and tosuccessfully compete in these markets and gain market share. We face intensecompetition in these markets from both established companies and newentrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive todevelop and bring to market.We will depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others,unproven business models and emerging wireless carrier models to deliverexisting services and to grow.     If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease.Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our abilityto buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on thereliability and security of their systems.  All of our services will bedelivered using airtime purchased from third parties.  We will depend onthese companies to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defectsand would not be able to satisfy our customers' needs if they failed toprovide the required capacity or needed level of service.  In addition, ourexpenses would increase and profitability could be materially adverselyaffected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services.Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one-yearterms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors,and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with theirservices.New laws and regulations that impact the industry could increase costs orreduce opportunities for us to earn revenue.     Except as described below under ""Governmental Regulation"", we are notcurrently subject to direct regulation by the Federal CommunicationsCommission or any other governmental agency, other than regulationsapplicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered inCalifornia. However, in the future, we may become subject to regulation bythe FCC or another regulatory agency. In addition, the wireless carriers thatsupply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject to regulation bythe FCC, and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduceour ability to continue selling and supporting our services.Governmental Regulation     CalAmp's products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvalsin the United States, Canada and other countries in which it operates.  Inthe United States, the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") regulatesmany aspects of communication devices including radiation of electromagneticenergy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to thetelephone network.  In Canada, similar regulations are administered byIndustry Canada.  Although CalAmp has obtained necessary FCC and IndustryCanada approvals for all products it currently sells, there can be noassurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timelybasis, or at all.  In addition, such regulatory requirements may change orthe Company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvalsfrom countries other than Canada or the United States in which it currentlysells its products or in which it may sell its products in the future.     The FCC and Industry Canada may be slow in adopting new regulationsallowing private wireless networks to deliver higher data rates in licensedfrequency bands for public safety applications.  This could adversely affectdemand for private networks as traditional private network users may opt forpublic network connections for all or part of their wireless communicationneeds.  This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,results of operations and financial condition since the Company's PublicSafety Mobile data products are currently used predominantly in privatenetworks"
0,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2007-05-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The following list describes several risk factors which are unique toour Company:The Company is dependent on its significant customers, the loss of any ofwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future sales andits ability to sustain its growth.     The Company's top two customers, Echostar and DirecTV, accounted for48.2% and 18.0%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales for fiscal2007. Echostar and DirecTV in the aggregate accounted for 69.2% of CalAmp'stotal net sales for fiscal 2006 and 60.5% of its total net sales for fiscal2005.  The loss of either Echostar or DirecTV as a customer, a deteriorationin the overall business of either of them, or a decrease in the volume ofsales by either of them, could result in decreased sales and could have amaterial adverse impact on CalAmp's ability to grow its DBS business.  Asubstantial decrease or interruption in business from any of the Company'ssignificant customers could result in write-offs or in the loss of futurebusiness and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,financial condition or results of operations.We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customersmay cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm ourrevenues.     We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.  As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us withany assurance of future sales.  These customers can cease purchasing productsfrom us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products fromour competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on eachorder and they are not required to make minimum purchases.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many ofour competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that ourproducts will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increasedmarket share.     The market for DBS products and other wireless products is intenselycompetitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingstandards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expectcompetition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offeringsand new competitors enter the market.  Given the highly competitiveenvironment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitiveadvantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establishand sustain our products in the market.  Any increase in price or othercompetition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent wehave obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on our financialcondition and results of operations.  We cannot provide assurance that wewill have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing andsupport capabilities to compete successfully.     Information about the Company's competitors is included in Part I, Item1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"".Multiple factors beyond the Company's control may cause fluctuations in ouroperating results and may cause our business to suffer.     The revenues and results of our operations may fluctuate significantly,depending on a variety of factors, including the following:	*  our dependence on a few major customers in our satellite         products business that currently account for a substantial majority of         our overall sales;	*  the introduction of new products and services by competitors;         and	*  seasonality in the equipment market for the U.S. DBS         subscription television industry.     We will not be able to control many of these factors.  In addition, ifour revenues in a particular period do not meet expectations, we may not beable to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause ourbusiness to suffer.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause the Company'squarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and its stock price to bevolatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors,many of which are outside of our control.  Some of the factors that couldaffect our quarterly or annual operating results include:	*	the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of,            orders for our products;	*	our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products            and product enhancements and manage product transitions;	*	announcements, new product introductions and reductions in price            of products offered by our competitors;	*	our ability to achieve cost reductions;	*	our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited            source components for our products;	*	our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and            quality levels for our products;	*	our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix            of distribution channels through which they are sold;	*	the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant            reduction in orders from those customers;      *     increased competition, particularly from larger, better            Capitalized competitors;	*     fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and	*	telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically            and economic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur at the end of a fiscal quarter.  Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results.  Inthe future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice.  Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue,expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future,and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications offuture performance.     Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturingservices are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times,our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause ouroperating results to suffer.     Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes.  Also, our DBS dish antennas, LNBF housings, subassemblies and some ofour electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for whichalternative sources are not readily available.  In the event of a reductionor interruption of supply, or a degradation in quality, as many as six monthscould be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies fromalternative suppliers, if any.  As a result, product shipments could bedelayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer.  Furthermore, ifwe receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary tomanufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand,customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share.If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could beadversely affected.     Our inability to develop new products or product features on a timelybasis, or the failure of new products or product features to achieve marketacceptance, could adversely affect our business.  In the past, CalAmp hasexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused them to incur unexpected expenses.  In addition, some of ourexisting customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products onthe addition of product features. In the past we have experienced delays inintroducing new features.

Our cost structure will be based in part on our expectations for futuredemand.  Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.  Rapid and unpredictable shiftsin demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacityand business operations efficiently.  If demand is significantly belowexpectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which candiminish gross margins and cause losses.  A sudden downturn may also leave uswith excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete as products evolveduring the downturn and demand shifts to newer products.  Our ability toreduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continueto invest in research and development to maintain our competitive positionand to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base.Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant coststo rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components andoutsource additional manufacturing processes.  These costs could reduce ourgross margins and overall profitability.  Any of these results couldadversely affect our business.Because we currently sell, and we intend to grow, the sales of certain of ourproducts in countries other than the United States, we are subject todifferent regulatory schemes.  We may not be able to develop products thatwork with the standards of different countries, which could result in ourinability to sell our products, and, further, we may be subject to political,economic, and other conditions affecting such countries that could result inreduced sales of our products and which could adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, standards and regulatoryrequirements are subject to change.  If we fail to anticipate or comply withthese new standards, our business and results of operations will be adverselyaffected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 6%, 5% and 3% ofCalAmp's total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2007, 2006 and2005, respectively.  Assuming that we continue to sell our products to suchcustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including Africa,the Middle East, Europe and Asia.  Any interruption or curtailment of tradebetween the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners,change in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward thesecountries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financialcondition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of ourproducts to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including futureimport and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness.     Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassembliesare currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong,mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries.  Any significantshift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturnin the political, economic or financial condition of these countries couldcause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, whichcould adversely affect our business.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and ourcompetitors may be able to offer similar products and services that wouldharm our competitive position.     Other than in our DBS products business, which currently does not dependupon patented technology, our ability to succeed in the wireless accessbusiness may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for someof our wireless products as well as software applications marketed by ourSolutions Division.  We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark andtrade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions toestablish and protect our intellectual property.  These mechanisms provide uswith only limited protection.  We currently hold 27 patents and have 1 patentapplication pending.  As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enterinto non-disclosure agreements with all of our executive officers, managersand supervisory employees.  Despite these precautions, third parties couldcopy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, ordevelop similar technology independently.  Furthermore, effective protectionof intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreigncountries.  The protection of our intellectual property rights may notprovide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently developsimilar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around anyintellectual property rights we hold.We may be subject to infringement claims which may disrupt the conduct of ourbusiness and affect our profitability.     We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to timerelating to the intellectual property of others, even though we take steps toassure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporateunlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products.  It is possiblethat third parties may claim that our products and services may infringe upontheir trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights.  Any such claims,regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delaysin introducing new or improved products or services, require us to enter intoroyalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challengedintellectual property.  Successful infringement claims against us maymaterially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.We may engage in future acquisitions that have adverse consequences for ourbusiness.     In April 2002 we completed the acquisition of the assets and business ofKaul-Tronics, Inc., in April 2004 we completed the acquisition of Vytek, andin April 2005 we acquired the Skybility business.  In May 2006 we acquiredDataradio and the TechnoCom MRM product line, in March 2007 we acquiredAircept and in April 2007 we acquired Smartlink Radio Networks.  We may makeadditional acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies in the futurein order to complement our existing product offerings, augment our marketcoverage or enhance our technological capabilities.  However, we cannot besure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities.  Theacquisitions that we have completed and that we may complete in the futurecould result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our resultsof operations or the price of our stock: (1) issuances of our equitysecurities that would dilute the percentage ownership of our currentstockholders; (2) large one-time write-offs; (3) the incurrence of debt andcontingent liabilities; (4) difficulties in the assimilation and integrationof the acquired companies; (5) diversion of management's attention from otherbusiness concerns; (6) contractual disputes; (7) risks of entering geographicand business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience;and (8) potential loss of key employees or customers of acquiredorganizations.Availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wirelesscommunications industry and demand for our products.

We face intensecompetition in these markets from both established companies and newentrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive todevelop and bring to market.We will depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others,unproven business models and emerging wireless carrier models to deliverexisting services and to grow.     If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease.Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our abilityto buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on thereliability and security of their systems.  All of our services will bedelivered using airtime purchased from third parties.  We will depend onthese companies to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defectsand would not be able to satisfy our customers' needs if they failed toprovide the required capacity or needed level of service.  In addition, ourexpenses would increase and profitability could be materially adverselyaffected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services.Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one-yearterms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors,and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with theirservices.Our software may contain defects or errors, and its sales could decrease ifthis injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software.     Our current software products and platforms are complex and must meetthe stringent technical requirements of customers. Therefore, we must developservices quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software andtelecommunications markets. Software as complex as that which will be offeredby us is likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially whenfirst introduced or when new versions are released. Some existing contractsrelated to software contain provisions that require us to repair or replaceproducts that fail to work. To the extent that such products are repaired orreplaced in the future, our expenses may increase, resulting in a decline inour gross margins. In addition, our software may not be free from errors ordefects after delivery to customers has begun, which could result in therejection of our software or services, damage to our reputation, lostrevenue, diverted development resources and increased service and warrantycosts.New laws and regulations that impact the industry could increase costs orreduce opportunities for us to earn revenue.     Except as described below under ""Governmental Regulation"", we are notcurrently subject to direct regulation by the Federal CommunicationsCommission or any other governmental agency, other than regulationsapplicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered inCalifornia. However, in the future, we may become subject to regulation bythe FCC or another regulatory agency. In addition, the wireless carriers thatsupply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject to regulation bythe FCC and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduceour ability to continue selling and supporting our services.Governmental Regulation     Dataradio's products are subject to certain mandatory regulatoryapprovals in the United States, Canada and other countries in which itoperates.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission(""FCC"") regulates many aspects of communication devices including radiationelectromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to beconnected to the telephone network.  In Canada, similar regulations areadministered by Industry Canada.  Although Dataradio has obtained necessaryFCC and Industry Canada approvals for all products it currently sells, therecan be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future productson a timely basis, or at all.  In addition, such regulatory requirements maychange or the Company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessaryapprovals from countries other than Canada or the United States in which itcurrently sells its products or in which it may sell its products in thefuture.     The FCC and Industry Canada may be slow in adopting new regulationsallowing private wireless networks to deliver higher data rates in licensedfrequency bands for public safety applications.  This could adversely affectdemand for private networks as traditional private network users may opt forpublic network connections for all or part of their wireless communicationneeds.  This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,results of operations and financial condition since Dataradio's products areused in private networks but not public networks"
2,CAMP,CALAMP CORP,2006-05-10,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The following list describes several risk factors which are unique toour Company:The Company is dependent on its significant customers, the loss of any ofwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future sales andits ability to sustain its growth.     The Company's top two customers, Echostar and DirecTV, accounted for55.5% and 13.7%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales for fiscal2006. Echostar and DirecTV in the aggregate accounted for 60.5% of CalAmp'stotal net sales for fiscal 2005 and 62.3% of its total net sales for fiscal2004.  The loss of either Echostar or DirecTV as a customer, a deteriorationin the overall business of either of them, or a decrease in the volume ofsales by either of them, could result in decreased sales and could have amaterial adverse impact on CalAmp's ability to sustain its growth.  Asubstantial decrease or interruption in business from any of the Company'ssignificant customers could result in write-offs or in the loss of futurebusiness and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,financial condition or results of operations.We do not currently have long-term contracts with customers and our customersmay cease purchasing products at any time, which could significantly harm ourrevenues.     We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.  As aresult, our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us withany assurance of future sales.  These customers can cease purchasing productsfrom us at any time without penalty, they are free to purchase products fromour competitors, they may expose us to competitive price pressure on eachorder and they are not required to make minimum purchases.Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many ofour competitors have greater resources than us, we cannot be certain that ourproducts will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increasedmarket share.     The market for DBS products and other wireless products is intenselycompetitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingstandards, short product life cycles, and price erosion. We expectcompetition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offeringsand new competitors enter the market.  Given the highly competitiveenvironment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitiveadvantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establishand sustain our products in the market.  Any increase in price or othercompetition could result in erosion of our market share, to the extent wehave obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on our financialcondition and results of operations.  We cannot provide assurance that wewill have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing andsupport capabilities to compete successfully.     Information about the Company's competitors is included in Part I, Item1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""COMPETITION"".Multiple factors beyond the Company's control may cause fluctuations in ouroperating results and may cause our business to suffer.     The revenues and results of our operations may fluctuate significantly,depending on a variety of factors, including the following:	* our dependence on a few major customers in our satellite productsbusiness that currently account for a substantial majority of our overallsales;	* the introduction of new products and services by competitors; and	* seasonality in the equipment market for the U.S. DBS subscriptiontelevision industry.     We will not be able to control many of these factors.  In addition, ifour revenues in a particular period do not meet expectations, we may not beable to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause ourbusiness to suffer.Our business is subject to many factors that could cause the Company'squarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and its stock price to bevolatile.     Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the pastand may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors,many of which are outside of our control.  Some of the factors that couldaffect our quarterly or annual operating results include:      * the timing and amount of, or cancellation or rescheduling of, ordersfor our products;      * our ability to develop, introduce, ship and support new products andproduct enhancements and manage product transitions;      * announcements, new product introductions and reductions in price ofproducts offered by our competitors;      * our ability to achieve cost reductions;      * our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited sourcecomponents for our products;      * our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and qualitylevels for our products;      * our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix ofdistribution channels through which they are sold;      * the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reductionin orders from those customers;      * increased competition, particularly from larger, better capitalized   competitors;      * fluctuations in demand for our products and services; and      * telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically andeconomic conditions generally.     Due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates,purchase orders and product availability, significant volume shipments ofproducts could occur at the end of a fiscal quarter.  Failure to shipproducts by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results.  Inthe future, our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orderswithout notice.  Due to these and other factors, our quarterly revenue,expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future,and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications offuture performance.Because some of our components, assemblies and electronics manufacturingservices are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times,our business is subject to unexpected interruptions, which could cause ouroperating results to suffer.     Some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long leadtimes.  Also, our DBS dish antennas, LNB housings, subassemblies and some ofour electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for whichalternative sources are not readily available.  In the event of a reductionor interruption of supply, or a degradation in quality, as many as six monthscould be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies fromalternative suppliers, if any.  As a result, product shipments could bedelayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer.  Furthermore, ifwe receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary tomanufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand,customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could losemarket share.Our lack of product diversification means that any decline in price or demandfor our company's products would adversely affect our business.     Our satellite and wireless access products will account for asubstantial portion of our revenue and are expected to do so for theforeseeable future.  Consequently, a decline in the price of, or demand for,our satellite or wireless access products, or their failure to achieve ormaintain broad market acceptance, could adversely affect our business.If we do not meet product introduction deadlines, our business could beadversely affected.     Our inability to develop new products or product features on a timelybasis, or the failure of new products or product features to achieve marketacceptance, could adversely affect our business.  In the past, CalAmp hasexperienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed thedevelopment, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements andwhich caused them to incur unexpected expenses.  In addition, some of ourexisting customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products onthe addition of product features. In the past we have experienced delays inintroducing new features.  Furthermore, in order to compete in some markets,we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operateat different frequencies and comply with diverse, new or varying governmentalregulations in each market.If demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, it may bedifficult to manage the business efficiently which may result in reducedgross margins and profitability.     Our cost structure will be based in part on our expectations for futuredemand.  Many costs, particularly those relating to capital equipment andmanufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.  Rapid and unpredictable shiftsin demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacityand business operations efficiently.  If demand is significantly belowexpectations, we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs, which candiminish gross margins and cause losses.  A sudden downturn may also leave uswith excess inventory, which may be rendered obsolete as products evolveduring the downturn and demand shifts to newer products.  Our ability toreduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continueto invest in research and development to maintain our competitive positionand to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base.Conversely, in the event of a sudden upturn, we may incur significant coststo rapidly expedite delivery of components, procure scarce components andoutsource additional manufacturing processes.  These costs could reduce ourgross margins and overall profitability.  Any of these results couldadversely affect our business.Because we intend to sell some of our products in countries other than theUnited States, subjecting us to different regulatory schemes, and we willhave a significant foreign supply base, we may not be able to developproducts that work with the different standards resulting in our inability tosell our products, and, further, we may be subject to political, economic,and other conditions affecting such countries that could result in reducedsales of our products and which could adversely affect our business.     If our sales are to grow in the longer term, we believe we must grow ourinternational business.  Many countries require communications equipment usedin their country to comply with unique regulations, including safetyregulations, radio frequency allocation schemes and standards.  If we cannotdevelop products that work with different standards, we will be unable tosell our products in those locations.  If compliance proves to be moreexpensive or time consuming than we anticipate, our business would beadversely affected.  Some countries have not completed their radio frequencyallocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which wewould be forced to comply.  Furthermore, standards and regulatoryrequirements are subject to change.  If we fail to anticipate or comply withthese new standards, our business and results of operations will be adverselyaffected.     Sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 5%, 3% and 4% ofCalAmp's total sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2006, 2005 and2004, respectively.  Assuming that we continue to sell our products to suchcustomers, we will be subject to the political, economic and other conditionsaffecting countries or jurisdictions other than the U.S., including Africa,the Middle East, Europe and Asia.  Any interruption or curtailment of tradebetween the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners,change in exchange rates, significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward thesecountries, or significant downturn in the political, economic or financialcondition of these countries, could cause demand for and sales of ourproducts to decrease, or subject us to increased regulation including futureimport and export restrictions, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness.     Additionally, a substantial portion of our components and subassembliesare currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in Hong Kong,mainland China, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries.  Any significantshift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturnin the political, economic or financial condition of these countries couldcause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations, whichcould adversely affect our business.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and ourcompetitors may be able to offer similar products and services that wouldharm our competitive position.     Other than in our DBS products business, which currently does not dependupon patented technology, our ability to succeed in the wireless accessbusiness may depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property for someof our wireless products as well as software applications marketed by ourSolutions Division.  We currently rely primarily on patents, trademark andtrade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions toestablish and protect our intellectual property.  These mechanisms provide uswith only limited protection.  We currently hold 19 patents and have 8 patentapplications pending.  As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enterinto non-disclosure agreements with all of our executive officers, managersand supervisory employees.  Despite these precautions, third parties couldcopy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, ordevelop similar technology independently.  Furthermore, effective protectionof intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreigncountries.  The protection of our intellectual property rights may notprovide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently developsimilar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around anyintellectual property rights we hold.We may be subject to infringement claims which may disrupt the conduct of ourbusiness and affect our profitability.     We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to timerelating to the intellectual property of others, even though we take steps toassure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporateunlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products.  It is possiblethat third parties may claim that our products and services may infringe upontheir trademark, patent, copyright, or trade secret rights.  Any such claims,regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive, cause delaysin introducing new or improved products or services, require us to enter intoroyalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challengedintellectual property.  Successful infringement claims against us maymaterially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability.We may engage in future acquisitions that have adverse consequences for ourbusiness.     In April 2002 we completed the acquisition of the assets and business ofKaul-Tronics, Inc., in April 2004 we completed the acquisition of Vytek, andin April 2005 we acquired the Skybility business.  We may make additionalacquisitions of businesses, products or technologies in the future in orderto complement our existing product offerings, augment our market coverage orenhance our technological capabilities.  However, we cannot be sure that wewill be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities.  The acquisitionsthat we have completed and that we may complete in the future could result inthe following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations orthe price of our stock: (1) issuances of our equity securities that woulddilute the percentage ownership of our current stockholders; (2) large one-time write-offs; (3) the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; (4)difficulties in the assimilation and integration of the acquired companies;(5) diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; (6)contractual disputes; (7) risks of entering geographic and business marketsin which we have no or only limited prior experience; and (8) potential lossof key employees or customers of acquired organizations.Cost of licenses to use radio frequencies may restrict the growth of thewireless communications industry and demand for our products.     Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services.  Theallocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and othercountries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated towireless services.  The growth of the wireless communications industry may beaffected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if newtechnologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currentlyallocated for such use.     Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the cost ofnew licenses required to use frequencies and the related frequency relocationcosts.  Typically, governments sell these licenses at auctions.  Over thelast several years, the costs of these licenses and the related frequencyrelocation costs have increased significantly.  The significant cost forlicenses and related frequency relocation costs have slowed and may continueto slow the growth of the industry.  Growth is slowed because some operatorshave funding constraints limiting their ability to purchase new licenses, paythe relocation costs or technology to upgrade systems and the financialresults for a number of businesses have been affected by the industry's rateof growth.  Slowed growth among operators may restrict the demand for ourproducts.A failure to rapidly transition or to transition at all to newer digitaltechnologies could adversely affect our business.     Our success, in part, will be affected by the ability of our wirelessbusinesses to continue its transition to newer digital technologies, andsuccessfully compete in that business and gain market share. We face intensecompetition in these markets from both established companies and newentrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive todevelop and bring to market.We will depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others,unproven business models and emerging wireless carrier models to deliverexisting services and to grow.     If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliablenetworks, we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease.Our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our abilityto buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on thereliability and security of their systems.  All of our services will bedelivered using airtime purchased from third parties.  We will depend onthese companies to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defectsand would not be able to satisfy our customers' needs if they failed toprovide the required capacity or needed level of service.  In addition, ourexpenses would increase and profitability could be materially adverselyaffected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services.Our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one-yearterms. Some of these wireless carriers are, or could become, our competitors,and if they compete with us, they may refuse to provide us with theirservices.Our software may contain defects or errors, and its sales could decrease ifthis injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software.     Our current software products and platforms are complex and must meetthe stringent technical requirements of customers. Therefore, we must developservices quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software andtelecommunications markets. Software as complex as that which will be offeredby us is likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially whenfirst introduced or when new versions are released. Some existing contractsrelated to software contain provisions that require us to repair or replaceproducts that fail to work. To the extent that such products are repaired orreplaced in the future, our expenses may increase, resulting in a decline inour gross margins. In addition, our software may not be free from errors ordefects after delivery to customers has begun, which could result in therejection of our software or services, damage to our reputation, lostrevenue, diverted development resources and increased service and warrantycosts.New laws and regulations that impact the industry could increase costs orreduce opportunities for us to earn revenue.     We are not currently subject to direct regulation by the FederalCommunications Commission or any other governmental agency, other thanregulations applicable to Delaware corporations of similar size that areheadquartered in California. However, in the future, we may become subject toregulation by the FCC or another regulatory agency. In addition, the wirelesscarriers that supply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject toregulation by the FCC and regulations that affect them could increase ourcosts or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services"
